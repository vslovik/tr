<seg id="2"> THUNDER </seg>
<seg id="3"> No nobody. Does not exist! </seg>
<seg id="4"> A sexy cheerleader who knows how to express himself ... </seg>
<seg id="5"> .. with a classic training νaga and a bit of brains in the head. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Not even one who knows how to pronounce "inextricable" ... </seg>
<seg id="7"> ..nothing to do a course of diction. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Well, you know ... IMONI </seg>
<seg id="9"> (Marie-Cécile) Why do you say so? Talk to some agent. </seg>
<seg id="10"> They have playful and bravery actresses. - Yes. I can handle it. </seg>
<seg id="11"> At the age of Vanda, at that time, a woman had married ... </seg>
<seg id="12"> He had had five children and had taken tuberculosis. </seg>
<seg id="13"> But nowadays they all talk like girls of ten years ... </seg>
<seg id="14"> .. who breathed the helium: "Too, too mythical!" </seg>
<seg id="15"> "It's a splash!" </seg>
<seg id="16"> I have nothing but a parade of thirty-five stronts ... </seg>
<seg id="17"> Half as a whore and the other half by lesbian. </seg>
<seg id="18"> I'd be a Vanda better than most of those girls. </seg>
<seg id="19"> With a suit and a pair of socks the game is done. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Ready? Ready, honey? </seg>
<seg id="21"> Oh, shit ... Ready? </seg>
<seg id="22"> - Fuck! (Vanda) Toc toc. </seg>
<seg id="23"> I'm late, are not they? Oh fuck! </seg>
<seg id="24"> Porca puttana! - If it is for "Furry Venus" ... </seg>
<seg id="25"> .. they've all gone for half an hour. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I'm sorry, but I was on the other side of Paris. </seg>
<seg id="27"> My cell phone was unloaded, I broke a heel ... </seg>
<seg id="28"> ... on one of those ventilation grids that you do not know what to do. </seg>
<seg id="29"> And then there was a guy on the metro that was rubbing me on ... </seg>
<seg id="30"> .. for everything the journey. </seg>
<seg id="31"> And finally, the thunderstorm. I'm wet to the marrow! </seg>
<seg id="32"> Dude, that's just my day. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Pussy fucking pussy! </seg>
<seg id="34"> Maybe there's a Valium in the medicine cabinet, do you want to watch? </seg>
<seg id="35"> No, it's just my usual luck. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Thank you, Lord, for making me the easy thing. </seg>
<seg id="37"> By the way, I'm present. </seg>
<seg id="38"> - Vanda Jourdain. - As? Vanda? </seg>
<seg id="39"> Do you understand? </seg>
<seg id="40"> I even got the right name. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Do you know many girls who are called "Vanda"? </seg>
<seg id="42"> I'm done for that part ... </seg>
<seg id="43"> .. and you put the metro station in the tunnel with the sleeve. </seg>
<seg id="44"> - Her name is? - Thomas Noavachek. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Pleasure ... Hey, for a moment! </seg>
<seg id="46"> - You are the author. - Yeah, well ... no. </seg>
<seg id="47"> I just did the adaptation. </seg>
<seg id="48"> "Yes, but she is also the director, are not they?" - Yes, I would say yes. </seg>
<seg id="49"> I love her pièces at least what I know. </seg>
<seg id="50"> "Anatomy of the shadow", immense! I have two left! </seg>
<seg id="51"> It's not mine. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Oh! But stupid. </seg>
<seg id="53"> - Do you mean that other one. - The other one? - What's wrong. </seg>
<seg id="54"> However this is too strong, at least for what I read. </seg>
<seg id="55"> It's ok, okay? Sexy in my opinion. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Or erotic, kind if you like humiliation and stuff like that. </seg>
<seg id="57"> They usually do not wander around in leather and with collar ... </seg>
<seg id="58"> They are a reserved type. </seg>
<seg id="59"> But I thought I should help get into the party. </seg>
<seg id="60"> - Is that shit sad? - Not exactly. </seg>
<seg id="61"> - It's set in 1870. - Ah, I understand. </seg>
<seg id="62"> - Do not do that much in 1870, are not they? - No not much. </seg>
<seg id="63"> - Maybe sadomasochists are already doing so. - Yes, I must know. </seg>
<seg id="64"> - I took a photo and the curriculum. - Very well, thank you. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Are they? Here ... </seg>
<seg id="66"> - Here is the photo ... and the curriculum. - Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="67"> It's true, it's a bit short, but I'm done for this part. </seg>
<seg id="68"> I stared at Hedda Gabbler and said I was delirious. </seg>
<seg id="69"> - The Oratory Theater? - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="70"> I did not have the pleasure of following their last season. </seg>
<seg id="71"> Do you have an appointment for this audition? </seg>
<seg id="72"> At 14. 15 ... a while ago. </seg>
<seg id="73"> - Vanda how ... he said? - Jourdain? </seg>
<seg id="74"> Everyone always wonders if it's an art name. </seg>
<seg id="75"> I do not know his name here. </seg>
<seg id="76"> Daννero? My agent swore that it was all right. </seg>
<seg id="77"> - I'm not in the list? - Please leave. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Fuck! Thank you again, Lord. </seg>
<seg id="79"> - But I'm here. - Wait, what does he do? </seg>
<seg id="80"> I also have the stage dress! </seg>
<seg id="81"> - No! - Wait! </seg>
<seg id="82"> - I have a bad suit. - It's useless. </seg>
<seg id="83"> Do not you want me to audition? - I do not want to do it, no! </seg>
<seg id="84"> - Since I'm here, we might blow it. - They're all gone. </seg>
<seg id="85"> - There is nobody to give her a joke. - She can do it. </seg>
<seg id="86"> For me it would be an honor for the author to give me the joke. </seg>
<seg id="87"> - The adapter. - It would be a force! </seg>
<seg id="88"> - Directly from the adapter. - All right, all right! </seg>
<seg id="89"> - To say no, Miss ... - Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="90"> - Let's get somebody out of here. - Oh yes? </seg>
<seg id="91"> - And who are you looking for? - Someone a little more ... </seg>
<seg id="92"> ..how to say... </seg>
<seg id="93"> All right, do not try. Someone who is not me. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Too low, too high, too wicked, too playful ... </seg>
<seg id="95"> My curriculum is too short, well I understand. </seg>
<seg id="96"> - But no, wait. - I got the balls full. </seg>
<seg id="97"> - Quiet. - It's not right. </seg>
<seg id="98"> Yes, I have enough. </seg>
<seg id="99"> My day was a nightmare. </seg>
<seg id="100"> We will organize other auditions. </seg>
<seg id="101"> Now I'm here, and I wanna go back tomorrow. </seg>
<seg id="102"> My day was also very stressful. </seg>
<seg id="103"> I had auditions at an army of failures. </seg>
<seg id="104"> One even a tooth device. </seg>
<seg id="105"> - It would not be the case now. - Okay. - I need to rest. </seg>
<seg id="106"> - Then they wait for me for dinner. - Yes, I see. </seg>
<seg id="107"> It will be better to do it when I become less tired. </seg>
<seg id="108"> Thanks for being kidded and compliments for the dress. </seg>
<seg id="109"> - Let's see you very soon. - Maybe it was but it's nice to say it. </seg>
<seg id="110"> A person's air is pleasing. </seg>
<seg id="111"> This is shit shit ... </seg>
<seg id="112"> Do not count the thirty euros for this fucking shit. </seg>
<seg id="113"> - Can not find "1800 and something"? - Sure! </seg>
<seg id="114"> - Do a lot of Vanda, do not you? - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="115"> In my opinion, I wear a stale dress ... </seg>
<seg id="116"> ... because at that time they all hated their ass. </seg>
<seg id="117"> - This is an inaccessibility. - Let her know how it is. </seg>
<seg id="118"> SINGLE CELL PHONE Please, be kind! </seg>
<seg id="119"> - Yup? - Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="120"> The line has fallen, but it was the thunderstorm. </seg>
<seg id="121"> No, no! </seg>
<seg id="122"> I do not talk to you, someone has just come in. </seg>
<seg id="123"> No I do not think so. </seg>
<seg id="124"> Then I take sushi along the road. </seg>
<seg id="125"> Hello. </seg>
<seg id="126"> Can you help me close it? </seg>
<seg id="127"> Thomas Noavachek in person will give me the jokes. </seg>
<seg id="128"> It will not be of great help to them, I'm not an actor. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Let's go, she's perfect. It's spit Kowalski. </seg>
<seg id="130"> - Well, Kushemski. - Kushemski. </seg>
<seg id="131"> - She is Kushemski. - I would not say that. </seg>
<seg id="132"> At your service, mess. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Where do we start from? Choose her, I do not have any preferences. </seg>
<seg id="134"> Let's take the first scene. </seg>
<seg id="135"> Okay. </seg>
<seg id="136"> - Does it have its share? - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="137"> - It's a bit run-down. - That's the full text. </seg>
<seg id="138"> - Who gave it to her? - I do not know. </seg>
<seg id="139"> - He sent me my agent. - And how did he get it? </seg>
<seg id="140"> Is this a problem? Is it top secret? Should not I see it? </seg>
<seg id="141"> It does not matter. </seg>
<seg id="142"> - Did you read it? - Yes, escape, on the metro. </seg>
<seg id="143"> I have no trace of anything. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Do you have Lou Reed's "Venus in furs" song? </seg>
<seg id="145"> No, it's from an Austrian novel: </seg>
<seg id="146"> "The Furry Venus" written by Léopold Von Sacher-Masoch. </seg>
<seg id="147"> I bet he can read the Austrian and read it in the original version. </seg>
<seg id="148"> Effectively yes. </seg>
<seg id="149"> The book made a scandal when it was published in 1870. </seg>
<seg id="150"> I believe it! It is only a sad saddle porn. </seg>
<seg id="151"> - It's not a porn sad. - Do not you find porn? </seg>
<seg id="152"> Not a little bit? </seg>
<seg id="153"> Since it was written in the Middle East in the 1800s and something? </seg>
<seg id="154"> "Furry Venus" is a beautiful love story ... </seg>
<seg id="155"> .. is one of the great texts in world literature. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Oh yes? For me, it's a porn. </seg>
<seg id="157"> And sadomasochism I know what it is, do them in the theater. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The term "masochism" comes from Sacher-Masoch and this book. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Ah! Masochism-Masoch. I should have arrived! </seg>
<seg id="160"> So this guy gave his name to sadomaso. </seg>
<seg id="161"> It was not his intention. - I would like to see! </seg>
<seg id="162"> Believe me a wrote a nice novel and everyone said it was porn. </seg>
<seg id="163"> - You broke the book? - No, I did it. </seg>
<seg id="164"> I have reinvented the dialogues, situations and ... </seg>
<seg id="165"> - There's so much to me here. - Great! </seg>
<seg id="166"> Do you wanna, kind, like place? </seg>
<seg id="167"> Type in a hotel that you find in a remote spot to the east ... </seg>
<seg id="168"> In the Austro-Hungarian Empire. - Make me remember. </seg>
<seg id="169"> - It's complicated. - Is that kind of a nice hotel? </seg>
<seg id="170"> Yes, it is a spa for wealthy people ... </seg>
<seg id="171"> .. a luxurious place. </seg>
<seg id="172"> The curtain is raised and Kushemski is in his room. </seg>
<seg id="173"> He's reading his book while he's having coffee. </seg>
<seg id="174"> And then ... toc toc! Enter Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="175"> And is it symbolic of the character of the character you read? </seg>
<seg id="176"> No, but there are still people reading the books. </seg>
<seg id="177"> - Even for books of paper. - Wrong. </seg>
<seg id="178"> This guy's what's called? Sévran, Séveran, Savrìne .. </seg>
<seg id="179"> - Séviser Von Kushemski. - Yes, yes. </seg>
<seg id="180"> What kind of person is it? </seg>
<seg id="181"> Tell me about the agents. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Rich, lazy, typical of his era, clever, traveler, educated. </seg>
<seg id="183"> - Intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="184"> - Just saying. - Ah, "so to speak." Adoro. </seg>
<seg id="185"> - I do not know it for so long. - What's strange? </seg>
<seg id="186"> - So she is a distinguished one, like her. - Do you want to talk about the character? </seg>
<seg id="187"> Yes, I know it by heart ... but yes, please, if you want! </seg>
<seg id="188"> I would say that under more than a dozen points is a joyous woman of her time ... </seg>
<seg id="189"> .. in spite of the principles that professes but ... </seg>
<seg id="190"> - In spite of what? Principles that profess. </seg>
<seg id="191"> A first person is a person in the post, posed and very educated. </seg>
<seg id="192"> Do not tell me! Anything else? </seg>
<seg id="193"> Something I do not know already like ... </seg>
<seg id="194"> Let's lose, I'll arrange it. </seg>
<seg id="195"> - Does it bother you if I change lighting? - Like lighting! </seg>
<seg id="196"> It's a bit over, do not you think? </seg>
<seg id="197"> Please, do it as if it were at your home. </seg>
<seg id="198"> Is not this better? </seg>
<seg id="199"> Not bad. </seg>
<seg id="200"> Aspects. </seg>
<seg id="201"> I would not know what button to crush. </seg>
<seg id="202"> So it is much better. </seg>
<seg id="203"> This is what I imagine. </seg>
<seg id="204"> Yes, it's the diva. </seg>
<seg id="205"> The scribe? </seg>
<seg id="206"> The book that has been reported to him? </seg>
<seg id="207"> There is the postcard, great! </seg>
<seg id="208"> What is this? </seg>
<seg id="209"> - A fake symbol? - They're the remains of the previous show. </seg>
<seg id="210"> A Belgian production of ... </seg>
<seg id="211"> "Red Shadows" adapted to musical comedy. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Do you want me to put me on? </seg>
<seg id="213"> Do you prefer ... </seg>
<seg id="214"> ..just in the middle. </seg>
<seg id="215"> Courtyard or garden side? - Garden. </seg>
<seg id="216"> Do you want us to re-read the text before we begin? </seg>
<seg id="217"> No, let's start. Up to do? </seg>
<seg id="218"> - End of page three. - Okay. And then he threw me out, did not they? </seg>
<seg id="219"> - In the meantime, we think we're screaming. - And then he threw me out. </seg>
<seg id="220"> - Look, I ... Ah, yes! Dimenticaνo ... </seg>
<seg id="221"> - The phrase that on page 0, like the quotation. The epigraph? </seg>
<seg id="222"> Yes, that. </seg>

<seg id="224"> It is a quotation that appears in the novel, is taken from the Book of Judith. </seg>
<seg id="225"> Is it in the Bible? - In the Apocryphal Books of the Bible, yes. </seg>
<seg id="226"> I do not know anything at all. </seg>
<seg id="227"> - Oh yes. Do not you think it's sexist? </seg>
<seg id="228"> "The Almighty Lord struck him and put him in the hands of a woman." </seg>
<seg id="229"> I just mention it to Sacher-Masoch's novel. </seg>
<seg id="230"> Yes, but I did not put it on zero page ... </seg>
<seg id="231"> She does nothing, I do not care, I'm just an actress. </seg>
<seg id="232"> I forget the fur! </seg>
<seg id="233"> - She's holding a stool, is not she? - Yes, in fact. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Fur, fur ... </seg>
<seg id="235"> Soft fur ... </seg>
<seg id="236"> Maybe it is not ... </seg>

<seg id="253"> Thank you very much. </seg>
<seg id="254"> I just asked the waitress to retire. </seg>
<seg id="255"> I should have done it, but there is a bold postcard inside. </seg>
<seg id="256"> It's a Titian, are not you? </seg>
<seg id="257"> Yup. </seg>
<seg id="258"> "Venus in the Mirror", one of my favorite paintings. </seg>
<seg id="259"> His Venus looks like he is well served ... </seg>

<seg id="262"> - How do you say, excuse me? - To the original. </seg>
<seg id="263"> Yes, it's a copy ... faithful to the original. </seg>
<seg id="264"> I understand his infatuation, it is a fascinating picture. </seg>
<seg id="265"> Thank you for having bothered to bring me back. </seg>
<seg id="266"> I could not avoid noticing the strange poetry written in the back. </seg>
<seg id="267"> "Furry Venus". Is it his work? </seg>
<seg id="268"> - They're bad guys. - Poor? Really? </seg>
<seg id="269"> "To love and be loved, or what a charm ..." </seg>

<seg id="276"> "My Venus in Fur." </seg>

<seg id="278"> If I were in her, I would pay close attention to this bookmark. </seg>
<seg id="279"> I appreciate your discretion. </seg>
<seg id="280"> Do you want to sit down for a moment? </seg>
<seg id="281"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="282"> - Can I take the fur? - Very kind to you. </seg>
<seg id="283"> It's a Tartar fur, do not you? </seg>
<seg id="284"> A Caucasian zibellino? I would say Kazakhstan. </seg>
<seg id="285"> A Kazakh cabbage jelly, exactly. </seg>
<seg id="286"> Kushemski, standing, looks at the fur in his hands. </seg>
<seg id="287"> But she's trembling! </seg>
<seg id="288"> Yes, please forgive me. </seg>
<seg id="289"> - Can I offer you something to drink? - Willingly. </seg>

<seg id="296"> So you are a poet, Herr Kuskhemski? </seg>
<seg id="297"> Lost time. </seg>
<seg id="298"> And is a passionate fox expert? </seg>
<seg id="299"> The love for the fur is ... </seg>
<seg id="300"> - Jumping this joke, the next is ... - No, read. </seg>
<seg id="301"> Love for fur is innate. </seg>
<seg id="302"> It is a passion given to everyone by nature. </seg>
<seg id="303"> It puts us a little more of a commitment. </seg>
<seg id="304"> Love for fur is innate. </seg>
<seg id="305"> It is a passion given to everyone by nature. </seg>
<seg id="306"> Caring a soft and thick fur ... </seg>
<seg id="307"> ... feel that particular tickle, that electricity ... </seg>
<seg id="308"> I think that for her is not just a gift of nature. </seg>
<seg id="309"> Did her mother embezzle her in a zibellino when she was small? </seg>
<seg id="310"> I'm indiscreet. </seg>
<seg id="311"> Please forgive me. - No me... </seg>
<seg id="312"> It was one of my aunts to have a passion for the fur. </seg>
<seg id="313"> - That's why that explains everything. - We can all easily explain. </seg>
<seg id="314"> - But we remain inextricable. - ίnestricabili? </seg>
<seg id="315"> - What do you mean? - Wisdom makes us what we are. </seg>
<seg id="316"> End of page three. </seg>
<seg id="317"> THUNDER </seg>
<seg id="318"> Effectively yes ... </seg>
<seg id="319"> - Very well, Vanda. - I was looking for clutches. </seg>
<seg id="320"> - I did what I could. He seemed very confident. </seg>
<seg id="321"> That's what it means to know how to create an atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="322"> - I'm a professional. - Yeah, yeah ... </seg>
<seg id="323"> - Stop it, I'll drop it red. - I did not say it was perfect. </seg>
<seg id="324"> - No, of course. - Are we going to go for a while? </seg>
<seg id="325"> After Kushemski made his speech ... </seg>
<seg id="326"> .. you go to ... </seg>
<seg id="327"> - Read this to help me enter the character. - żo recito. </seg>
<seg id="328"> - She's doing fine, Thomas. - No, it's an impression. </seg>
<seg id="329"> She speaks very well. </seg>
<seg id="330"> Has anyone ever thought about someone for Kushemski? - Not exactly. </seg>
<seg id="331"> - I have options. - She should do it. </seg>
<seg id="332"> - Yes sure! - I think so seriously. </seg>
<seg id="333"> - She would be very good at it. - However, it is difficult. </seg>
<seg id="334"> - Let's get all this out to the actors ... - He's the director, he's his dad. </seg>
<seg id="335"> - For director is the first one. - It would not be. </seg>
<seg id="336"> I decided to do it because the directors never understand anything. </seg>
<seg id="337"> - You do not know what I endured ... - That's why it's perfect. </seg>
<seg id="338"> - You know what you need to do. - I've got everything in my head. </seg>
<seg id="339"> I want to use the "Lyrical Suite" by Alban Berg for transitions ... </seg>
<seg id="340"> - Great as an idea! - Do you know the "Lyrical Suite"? </seg>
<seg id="341"> No, but do you understand that I want to say? </seg>
<seg id="342"> - You know the story of interiority, characters, everything! - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="343"> For Kushemski, she should look something like an accent ... </seg>
<seg id="344"> ... or stuff like that. - He's a distinguished man. </seg>
<seg id="345"> - Yes. - And with one I do not know ... </seg>
<seg id="346"> Aristocratic. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Is it quite distinct if I move that way? </seg>
<seg id="348"> Or is it just stupid? </seg>
<seg id="349"> It's a bit chunky but it's great. </seg>
<seg id="350"> - Would not it be a room for you? - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="351"> - I was joking! - Want to pass it on? </seg>
<seg id="352"> Courage, it will help. </seg>
<seg id="353"> But it's magnificent. </seg>
<seg id="354"> - Is it wrong or is it vintage? - So they told me. </seg>
<seg id="355"> Siegfried Mueller ... </seg>
<seg id="356"> ..Vienna ... </seg>
<seg id="357"> .. 1869. </seg>
<seg id="358"> I did not do it. </seg>
<seg id="360"> It looks tailor made for her. </seg>
<seg id="361"> - How do you feel about it? - Very well. </seg>
<seg id="362"> And I'm brushing it. </seg>
<seg id="363"> - It's her figure. - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="364"> Hello nice guy. </seg>
<seg id="365"> And that dog collar how much did he pay for it? </seg>
<seg id="366"> It is a reminder of the period when the pavement is bathed. </seg>
<seg id="367"> Joke! </seg>
<seg id="368"> Let's get back from a few more farther backs. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Did her mother embezzle her in a zibellino when she was small? </seg>
<seg id="370"> I'm indiscreet, please excuse me. </seg>
<seg id="371"> It was one of my aunts to have a passion for the fur. </seg>
<seg id="372"> - It's all right for him to say this. - Yes, no wonder. </seg>
<seg id="373"> - Then take courage. - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="374"> I'm indiscreet, please excuse me. </seg>
<seg id="375"> It was one of my aunts to have a passion for the fur. </seg>
<seg id="376"> - That's why that explains everything. - We can all easily explain. </seg>
<seg id="377"> But we remain inextricable. </seg>
<seg id="378"> lnestricabili! </seg>
<seg id="379"> What do you mean? </seg>
<seg id="380"> Wisdom makes us what we are in an unpredictable moment. </seg>
<seg id="381"> Coffee is your liking? </seg>
<seg id="382"> I just tasted it but it looks great. </seg>
<seg id="383"> And this is symbolic, do not you? Ίl coffee is he ... </seg>
<seg id="384"> .. and she just tasted it but she's already excited. </seg>
<seg id="385"> In fact, he unmasks me. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Have you ever experienced such a "unforeseen moment"? </seg>
<seg id="387"> Actually yes, but I do not want to bother you. </seg>
<seg id="388"> All the while, so fascinates me. </seg>
<seg id="389"> Like one of those English policing novels. </seg>
<seg id="390"> I look like mysterious aunt who loved the fur. </seg>
<seg id="391"> - This part we can skip it. - No, read it. I want to hear it. </seg>
<seg id="392"> I look like mysterious aunt who loved the fur. </seg>
<seg id="393"> I was an infernal baby ... </seg>
<seg id="394"> Cruel and cruel. </seg>
<seg id="395"> Martyrize our maids and our cat. </seg>
<seg id="396"> I also behave badly with one of my aunts. </seg>
<seg id="397"> The Countess was a majestic, vulgar and terrible woman .. </seg>
<seg id="398"> - What's up? - Anything. </seg>
<seg id="399"> It's just that by telling her to hear high the words I wrote ... </seg>
<seg id="400"> ... two in the morning on a screen seem to be dimmed. </seg>
<seg id="401"> If she's yanking her big! </seg>
<seg id="402"> What did your aunt do? </seg>
<seg id="403"> One evening she was hesitant. </seg>
<seg id="404"> It came to my room ... </seg>
<seg id="405"> With his big black coat of Russia. </seg>
<seg id="406"> In the hand there is a need, a branch of birch ... </seg>
<seg id="407"> With her there was the cook and the maid. </seg>
<seg id="408"> The fur has been removed and the sleeves are rolled ... </seg>
<seg id="409"> I have tried to escape ... </seg>
<seg id="410"> The other women have taken hold of me ... </seg>
<seg id="411"> They lowered my pants and threw me on the fur. </seg>
<seg id="412"> They keep me silent as my aunt casts me with her. </seg>
<seg id="413"> My buttocks and bare thighs were on fire. </seg>
<seg id="414"> The maids encourage her. </seg>
<seg id="415"> They played for me, they treat me as feminine. </seg>
<seg id="416"> I do not mind it but my aunt continued to hit me ... </seg>
<seg id="417"> .. until the moment I did not beg to stop ... </seg>
<seg id="418"> .. for piety. </seg>
<seg id="419"> When she finally stopped, she forced me to thank her ... </seg>
<seg id="420"> And kissing her feet. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Then later he left the room threatening to return. </seg>
<seg id="422"> And all this in the presence of the maids ... </seg>
<seg id="423"> And our cat. </seg>
<seg id="424"> Starting from that moment ... </seg>
<seg id="425"> ... fur was no longer a simple fur ... </seg>
<seg id="426"> A branch of birch a simple branch. </seg>
<seg id="427"> In a moment she made me ... what I am. </seg>
<seg id="428"> - And is he coming back? - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="429"> In my dreams, with her black fur and her śerga. </seg>
<seg id="430"> And she wants to make me sleepy again, night after night. </seg>
<seg id="431"> - My friend. Poor? </seg>
<seg id="432"> She taught me the most precious thing in the world. </seg>
<seg id="433"> - And what did she teach her? - That nothing is more sensual than pain. </seg>
<seg id="434"> That nothing is more exciting than degradation. </seg>
<seg id="435"> The Countess has done well to her. </seg>
<seg id="436"> My ideal is quenched. </seg>
<seg id="437"> From that day I look for her double. </seg>
<seg id="438"> And when I meet that woman I will marry her. </seg>
<seg id="439"> This passage is sensational! </seg>
<seg id="440"> Thank you, they asked me a lot of them. </seg>
<seg id="441"> In practical terms, is it a kind of child maltreatment? </seg>
<seg id="442"> It does not matter. </seg>
<seg id="443"> What the fuck does the child abuse with this story? </seg>
<seg id="444"> Punch this, this mania of our day ... </seg>
<seg id="445"> To bring everything back to a social problem of the dick. </seg>
<seg id="446"> - Maltreatment is not just ... - Do not follow the stereotypes! </seg>
<seg id="447"> We are not talking about anthropology or sociology! </seg>
<seg id="448"> - Let's do theater. - Yes, but anyway ... </seg>
<seg id="449"> Here's much more about the issue of corporal punishment. </seg>
<seg id="450"> All right, excuse me! </seg>
<seg id="451"> In what impetuous and dull world we live! </seg>
<seg id="452"> Why do we always try to bring everything back to something else? </seg>
<seg id="453"> What else will he pull out right now? Sexism, racism, class struggle? </seg>
<seg id="454"> Well, you are certainly unique, Herr Kushemski. </seg>
<seg id="455"> If I were in her, I would be careful. </seg>
<seg id="456"> His ideal woman might reel more cruel than he does not want. </seg>
<seg id="457"> I'm ready to run the risk. </seg>
<seg id="458"> I know what she is ... A suzrasensuale. </seg>
<seg id="459"> An ascetic of the ull. </seg>
<seg id="460"> And you, Frau Vanda νon Dunaye, who or what? </seg>
<seg id="461"> I am a pagan. </seg>
<seg id="462"> It means they are playful, beautiful, rich ... </seg>
<seg id="463"> .. and that you can take advantage of them as much as possible. </seg>
<seg id="464"> I will not deny anything. </seg>
<seg id="465"> I have the utmost respect for its principles. </seg>
<seg id="466"> Please excuse me, but I am afraid of his respect. </seg>
<seg id="467"> I will love the man who will please me ... </seg>
<seg id="468"> .. and I'm happy with the man who will make me happy ... </seg>
<seg id="469"> I just do it until it makes me happy and then I'll find another one. </seg>
<seg id="470"> For a man there is no greater cruelty than the unfaithfulness of a woman. </seg>
<seg id="471"> For a woman there is worse: forced loyalty. </seg>
<seg id="472"> - Can I move? - Yes, yes ... he moved. </seg>
<seg id="473"> In our company ... </seg>
<seg id="474"> ... the woman can only have power through the intercession of a man. </seg>
<seg id="475"> What will be the woman when she will equal the man? </seg>
<seg id="476"> When will she hurt her? </seg>
<seg id="477"> Little Vanda is a sack for his time! </seg>
<seg id="478"> How do you know all the jokes? </seg>
<seg id="479"> - I do not know, I learn in a hurry. - He knows all the text by heart! </seg>
<seg id="480"> Did not she say Vanda is in a good position in spite of what? </seg>
<seg id="481"> - Principles that profess. - Here are those. - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="482"> According to you Vanda does not believe all these stories. </seg>
<seg id="483"> That's what he says ... the rights of women, blah blah blah ... </seg>
<seg id="484"> But for her, kind of, a character, mind. </seg>
<seg id="485"> Because he said "the principles he professes" and not "his principles." </seg>
<seg id="486"> I think I really liked the alliteration: "of the principles that profess." </seg>
<seg id="487"> I see! </seg>
<seg id="488"> He sold the soul for an all-match. </seg>
<seg id="489"> It is, I declare myself guilty. </seg>
<seg id="490"> Said among us, Thomas, you're a little dick. </seg>
<seg id="491"> If it allows, I would say that ... </seg>
<seg id="492"> She is better than a pagan. It seems to me a goddess. </seg>
<seg id="493"> - Really? And which? - Venus. </seg>
<seg id="494"> And is Vanda Venere, or am I kidding? </seg>
<seg id="495"> Is Venus who has taken human semblance to come to torment him? </seg>
<seg id="496"> Not exactly. </seg>
<seg id="497"> - Or rather not exactly. - Okay, there are! It's dull. </seg>
<seg id="498"> - She wants you to be ambivalent. - Ambiguo. - Yes, that one. </seg>
<seg id="499"> In reality, it is the story of "The Baccanti". </seg>
<seg id="500"> What was "The Baccanti"? </seg>
<seg id="501"> - It's a knife, do not you? - It's a very old pièce. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Citizens of Corinth. It is before you a Testiculus ... </seg>
<seg id="503"> ... but mortal cursed by gods for his offenses ... </seg>
<seg id="504"> ..and completely fucked up to the end of time. </seg>
<seg id="505"> - Is this a pie of this kind? - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="506"> Diòniso goes down to Earth and makes the arrogant king of Tebe ... </seg>
<seg id="507"> .. a tremula gelatin laden by a woman. - It would be exciting. </seg>
<seg id="508"> After that, the unleashed women of Tebe the Baccanti broke it. </seg>
<seg id="509"> And Diòniso came back to his house, triumphant. - I think I've seen her. </seg>
<seg id="510"> In our case, however, this is not about Diòniso but Aphrodite. </seg>
<seg id="511"> Who is it? </seg>
<seg id="512"> - It's the Greek version of Venus. - But it is the same person. </seg>
<seg id="513"> The same goddess. - Ave or Aphrodite! </seg>
<seg id="514"> Aye, oh Aphrodite. Are they so unbearably pedantic? </seg>
<seg id="515"> Yes, but I find it a nice thing. </seg>
<seg id="516"> Yup. </seg>
<seg id="517"> What are we doing? </seg>
<seg id="518"> It seems to me a goddess. </seg>
<seg id="519"> Really? And which? </seg>
<seg id="520"> Venus. </seg>
<seg id="521"> But Venus can only rule in a world of slaves. </seg>
<seg id="522"> Then it will be better for me to find one. </seg>
<seg id="523"> Would you like to be my slave, Herr Doktor Kushemski? </seg>
<seg id="524"> I am already. </seg>
<seg id="525"> I was depressed by his slaughter from the time he entered this room. </seg>
<seg id="526"> Have you already fallen in love with me? </seg>
<seg id="527"> Deeply. </seg>
<seg id="528"> I'm suffering as if I've known her forever. </seg>
<seg id="529"> - I'm sorry. - Get up straight away and get away from me. </seg>
<seg id="530"> I have to confess that it intrigues me. </seg>
<seg id="531"> I love her frankness and the clarity of her thoughts. </seg>
<seg id="532"> From a point of physical illness, she has charm, no doubt. </seg>
<seg id="533"> But if a man submits me, I sniff a trap ... </seg>
<seg id="534"> There are no traps. You love Me! </seg>
<seg id="535"> - You see? He has already begun to give orders. - Marry me. </seg>
<seg id="536"> I'm a naughty woman, Herr Kushemski. </seg>
<seg id="537"> To love me, she will have to give great courage. </seg>
<seg id="538"> - I've already explained my principles. - I do not care. </seg>
<seg id="539"> - I want my wife down. - She does not know anything about me. </seg>
<seg id="540"> - You dominate me. - Is absurd. </seg>
<seg id="541"> You give me complete power over me, for eternity. </seg>
<seg id="542"> Do me what you want. </seg>
<seg id="543"> - Dominate me, peep me if you want me. - This comes to me unexpected. </seg>
<seg id="544"> - Let's get that side. - Thing? </seg>
<seg id="545"> - He puts himself in the middle, bottom. - No, I'm fine here. </seg>
<seg id="546"> He would have to move there. </seg>
<seg id="547"> It takes power and puts itself in a position of power. </seg>
<seg id="548"> Recapture. </seg>
<seg id="549"> - This comes to me unexpected. - Yes. - Not good! </seg>
<seg id="550"> It does not die, I do. </seg>
<seg id="551"> You give me complete power over me for eternity, unconditionally. </seg>
<seg id="552"> Do me what you want. Dominate me. </seg>
<seg id="553"> I peek if you want. </seg>
<seg id="554"> - This comes to me unexpected. - She does not even pretend to smoke? </seg>
<seg id="555"> Want me to put me here, I put myself here. </seg>
<seg id="556"> And then it's just a hearing. </seg>
<seg id="557"> It is also a hearing to see if you accept to be direct. </seg>
<seg id="558"> Do what I say and stay there. </seg>
<seg id="559"> You give me complete power over me for eternity, unconditionally. </seg>
<seg id="560"> Do me what you want, dominate me. </seg>
<seg id="561"> - Peak if you want. - This comes to me unexpected. </seg>
<seg id="562"> - You're right, it's better. - Keep going. </seg>
<seg id="563"> What do you want in the depths of your heart? </seg>
<seg id="564"> To belong to her ... </seg>
<seg id="565"> ..compare in its sublime essence ... </seg>
<seg id="566"> ..discover and sneeze it ... </seg>
<seg id="567"> ..drug her stockings, put on her shoes ... </seg>
<seg id="568"> ..nothing more than my own. </seg>
<seg id="569"> And this she calls him love? - It's the only love we have. </seg>
<seg id="570"> In love, as in politics, only one of the parties must have power. </seg>
<seg id="571"> One must be the hammer and the other the anvil. </seg>
<seg id="572"> I agree that I am an anvil. </seg>
<seg id="573"> That's enough. </seg>
<seg id="574"> Keep it, I like it! </seg>
<seg id="575"> Thomas, but what intelligence, especially for women. </seg>
<seg id="576"> - You understand them by women. - Yes, yes ... years of studies. </seg>
<seg id="577"> - Where was I left? - She was an anvil. </seg>
<seg id="578"> Vanda, I'm looking for the pain and her pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="579"> Never let yourself be dominated by the feelings of others. </seg>
<seg id="580"> She uses her lover as he would serve her. </seg>
<seg id="581"> The domain, saves it like a lemon. </seg>
<seg id="582"> She is amazing. </seg>
<seg id="583"> If you do not want me as a husband, take me as a slave. </seg>
<seg id="584"> I deal with cruelty. </seg>
<seg id="585"> Why should I mistreat anyone who loves me? </seg>
<seg id="586"> - But I would love her even more. - I do not want to be worshiped. </seg>
<seg id="587"> All women want to be worshiped, like our Creator. </seg>
<seg id="588"> Create me! I ruin! It reduces me to nothing! </seg>
<seg id="589"> SELLING THE CELL </seg>
<seg id="590"> For a moment, excuse me. </seg>
<seg id="591"> Ready? Yup. </seg>
<seg id="592"> No, I have not left yet. </seg>
<seg id="593"> Everything is alright. </seg>
<seg id="594"> It's all right ... </seg>
<seg id="595"> I do not know. </seg>
<seg id="596"> The moment, huh? </seg>
<seg id="597"> Do I call you when I leave? </seg>
<seg id="598"> Yes, I too, my love. </seg>
<seg id="599"> - Yes, then ... Yes, all right. </seg>
<seg id="600"> Excuse me, huh? </seg>
<seg id="601"> For the hearing I do not know. </seg>
<seg id="602"> Now I'm at the temporary agency, maybe they have something. </seg>
<seg id="603"> As a typist, a nightmare in an important law firm. </seg>
<seg id="604"> The contract is for tomorrow. </seg>
<seg id="605"> I do not know! </seg>
<seg id="606"> Whatever will be, will be. </seg>
<seg id="607"> That's right, I'm sorry. </seg>
<seg id="608"> - Crazy! - His half? </seg>
<seg id="609"> Is that still said? - She says half today? </seg>
<seg id="610"> - Do not I know ... asshole? - Ah okay. </seg>
<seg id="611"> - Wondering why I lied? - No, I do not care. </seg>
<seg id="612"> How is that Vanda saying? </seg>
<seg id="613"> "I will not deny anything, I have other cats to fuck." </seg>
<seg id="614"> - Stupid way of saying. - She's the hammer, he's the anvil. </seg>
<seg id="615"> What I have to say? "Yes, dear, all you need"? </seg>
<seg id="616"> This has nothing to do with love, but with my ass. </seg>
<seg id="617"> And if he does, he must take the rest. </seg>
<seg id="618"> - That's what he's talking about. - Oh yes? </seg>
<seg id="619"> Do you play me? </seg>
<seg id="620"> - I do not know, do you believe it? - Stop doing it. </seg>
<seg id="621"> Can not one of you say what you think? </seg>
<seg id="622"> Talking with her is more complicated than dancing the tango. </seg>
<seg id="623"> Do not you want her to have a coffee? </seg>
<seg id="624"> Why, what is it? </seg>
<seg id="625"> - Are you dying? - Absolutely not! </seg>
<seg id="626"> I'm just offering her a coffee. </seg>
<seg id="627"> - Is it a symbolic coffee? - No, it's a coffee. </seg>
<seg id="628"> What would his wife say if she wanted to offer me a "no coffee"? </seg>
<seg id="629"> - I'm not married. - Ma νa? </seg>
<seg id="630"> I guess so soon on the phone. </seg>
<seg id="631"> - He was my girlfriend. - It's the same. </seg>
<seg id="632"> What would you think? In an interview he said: </seg>
<seg id="633"> "The theater is the best way to get girls in bed". </seg>
<seg id="634"> Do not tell me she read that stuff. </seg>
<seg id="635"> I was young, it was my first interview. </seg>
<seg id="636"> - Have you ever been married? - Never. </seg>
<seg id="637"> - And she still lives with her mother? - I'm strange but not so much. </seg>
<seg id="638"> Is your fur going to pass his passion? </seg>
<seg id="639"> - No, it's love. - She's strangely funny. </seg>
<seg id="640"> And my wife must be my muse. </seg>
<seg id="641"> So your girlfriend has a pair of wings and everything else? </seg>
<seg id="642"> In love you have to launch completely. </seg>
<seg id="643"> And she dives. - I swear to fish ... </seg>
<seg id="644"> With fireworks, dizziness and thunder. </seg>
<seg id="645"> Coffee yes or no coffee? </seg>
<seg id="646"> I conceive of giving myself to a man for the sake of losing his slave. </seg>
<seg id="647"> I would say that we are not compatible at all, Herr Kushemski. </seg>
<seg id="648"> We will annul ourselves. </seg>
<seg id="649"> And I'd say we're done for each other. </seg>
<seg id="650"> Is not that what you hear, Vanda? Is not that what you hear too? </seg>
<seg id="651"> I offer you a try, a contract like a business. </seg>
<seg id="652"> It will take a year to prove to me that it is the man I need. </seg>
<seg id="653"> - One year is long. - I have not finished yet. </seg>
<seg id="654"> - Please forgive me. - You will be my slave for a year. </seg>
<seg id="655"> So do not do anything! </seg>
<seg id="656"> Awaits everything before entering. </seg>
<seg id="657"> - She believes? - Stop doing the naive. </seg>
<seg id="658"> - She is the author. - I'm not sure he has prepared everything. </seg>
<seg id="659"> And I'm honest, I swear. </seg>
<seg id="660"> So is he kidding? It is ambivalent. </seg>
<seg id="661"> - Ambiguo. - Yes, yes. </seg>
<seg id="662"> Or he's a lazy bitch, ready for anything to enjoy. </seg>
<seg id="663"> A lazy bitch? Have not you ever thought about her like that. </seg>
<seg id="664"> It can be even more complicated. </seg>
<seg id="665"> "Be my slave for a year and then I'll fuck you." </seg>
<seg id="666"> - It's always ambivalent, do not you? - Ambiguo. </seg>
<seg id="667"> - Ambiguo. - From my point of departure, indeed from that of Kushemski ... </seg>
<seg id="668"> ..would be his last chance. Maybe even the only one. </seg>
<seg id="669"> And to do that? </seg>
<seg id="670"> - Of νiνere. - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="671"> He loves whiplashes and wants to know if he likes it too. </seg>
<seg id="672"> - She makes a hearing. - She also makes a hearing with him. </seg>
<seg id="673"> He is a weird and she is an object like all the women of 1800. </seg>
<seg id="674"> What's up? </seg>
<seg id="675"> So who are you, Frau Vanda Jourdain? </seg>
<seg id="676"> - I'm a pagan. - No, I'm serious. </seg>
<seg id="677"> It starts to move on. </seg>
<seg id="678"> Where does it come from? What's his story about? </seg>
<seg id="679"> Military Daughter, grown up around, I have no tenderness. </seg>
<seg id="680"> Have you been? In which city? Ίn which countries? </seg>
<seg id="681"> I will make a contract whereby you agree that you will be my slave for a year. </seg>
<seg id="682"> - I'll be in your orders. - It's a deal. </seg>
<seg id="683"> They swap a handshake. </seg>
<seg id="684"> - There is a Greek officer in the hotel. A Greek? - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="685"> It comes from Athens. </seg>
<seg id="686"> She has a white stallion like her and she has black leather stitches. </seg>
<seg id="687"> I want you to get my room number. </seg>
<seg id="688"> - But, Vanda ... What is it? </seg>
<seg id="689"> Are you already reluctant? - Please forgive me. </seg>
<seg id="690"> Tomorrow you will be waiting for me in the birch forest, and at the statue of Aphrodite. </seg>
<seg id="691"> - At what time? You will wait until the moment I decide to quit. </seg>
<seg id="692"> - Very well. - Do not show up without the Greek Chamber Number. </seg>
<seg id="693"> And now, kiss my foot. </seg>
<seg id="694"> And he kneels and kisses his foot. </seg>
<seg id="695"> I love this part, it is very straightforward. </seg>
<seg id="696"> Pass me the fur now. </seg>
<seg id="697"> Séäin, how's it going to end? </seg>
<seg id="698"> This only depends on you, Frau Vanda νon Dunayeν, and not from me. </seg>
<seg id="699"> Thank you for coffee, slave. </seg>
<seg id="700"> Yes, I would be right now. A coffee I mean. </seg>
<seg id="701"> It was intense. The handshake was electric. </seg>
<seg id="702"> The happiness of an era when people were more introverted. </seg>
<seg id="703"> A simple confusion had already left eroticism. </seg>
<seg id="704"> The conversation. The only thing to put under your teeth. </seg>
<seg id="705"> The book does not start that way, do not you? </seg>
<seg id="706"> - The book? - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="707"> The beginning scene is over ... </seg>
<seg id="708"> When does Venus look naked in his fur at the fireplace? </seg>
<seg id="709"> - Did you read "Furry Venus"? - I gave him a look. </seg>
<seg id="710"> When he said he did not know what it was about, he lied. </seg>
<seg id="711"> I took a little advantage. </seg>
<seg id="712"> - Why did not she take that scene? - I did not know how to use it. </seg>
<seg id="713"> Just put it at the beginning, kind before meeting with Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="714"> You can not think of making "Venus in Fur" without Venus. </seg>
<seg id="715"> And she can use the same actress for Vanda and Venus. </seg>
<seg id="716"> - Naked in the scene? No problem. - Yes, I'll think about it. </seg>
<seg id="717"> - Why do not we impoverish? She'll give you ideas. - And how? </seg>
<seg id="718"> You have to change the lights. </seg>
<seg id="719"> - Are we at the top of the pièce? - In the room of Kushemski ... </seg>
<seg id="720"> ..in the middle of the night. </seg>
<seg id="721"> Okay, heart of night, two in the morning. </seg>
<seg id="722"> We laugh a bit ... </seg>
<seg id="723"> Fire in the fireplace, garden side. </seg>
<seg id="724"> Yes, very good. </seg>
<seg id="725"> What is Kushemski doing? </seg>
<seg id="726"> - I do not know. - What a fantasy! </seg>
<seg id="727"> Too much discount? </seg>
<seg id="728"> He is also reading when he meets Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="729"> He can not even read at the beginning, we are not in the library. </seg>
<seg id="730"> Maybe he could write his diary. </seg>
<seg id="731"> I like this. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Yup. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Then I'm Venus. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Who cares! </seg>
<seg id="735"> Do as if I were naked. Are you trying with me? </seg>
<seg id="736"> Imagine being a girlfriend and sudden. </seg>
<seg id="737"> - Ah, it's the first I have to do. - All the girls say. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Yeah, but for me it's the little thing. </seg>
<seg id="739"> The fire in the fireplace burns, we see Venus naked ... </seg>
<seg id="740"> ... lazily in a fur ... </seg>
<seg id="741"> Strength, I'm in the fur. </seg>
<seg id="742"> She is the director. </seg>
<seg id="743"> I said "leave it". </seg>
<seg id="744"> Now let's go to scrijevania. </seg>
<seg id="745"> Give him the character. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Scriava on her diary. </seg>
<seg id="747"> - She screams. - I'm doing. </seg>
<seg id="748"> But at high waits, we're at the theater! If not how do we know who it is? </seg>
<seg id="749"> We are at the beginning of the pièce. </seg>
<seg id="750"> The scene lights up little by little ... </seg>
<seg id="751"> .. we hear the tic tac of a spade pendulum. </seg>
<seg id="752"> Tic tac ... </seg>
<seg id="753"> ..tic tac ... </seg>
<seg id="754"> ..tic tac ... </seg>
<seg id="755"> ..tic tac! </seg>
<seg id="757"> Two in the morning. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Stay in a spa ... </seg>
<seg id="759"> Surrounded by forests and mountains. </seg>
<seg id="760"> It is a moonless night, darkness and silence reign. </seg>
<seg id="761"> VANDA FITTING A moment! I hear a sparrow. </seg>
<seg id="762"> - A nightingale. - A nightingale. </seg>
<seg id="763"> VANDA MLAGOLA </seg>
<seg id="764"> And the calling of a cat in heat. </seg>
<seg id="765"> I feel tremendously only ... </seg>
<seg id="766"> ... happy, dissatisfied. </seg>
<seg id="767"> (In German) Good evening. </seg>
<seg id="768"> Well, did the Germans want us another? </seg>
<seg id="769"> I hope not to bother. </seg>
<seg id="770"> Absolutely not. </seg>
<seg id="771"> Aye, Aphrodite. </seg>
<seg id="772"> - So you did not forget me! - Forget about you? </seg>
<seg id="773"> My dearest and worst enemy? </seg>
<seg id="774"> - You're too kind. - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="775"> Do I have a right to a small kiss? </seg>
<seg id="776"> - That's better, but Thomas ... - Oh! - Did I say Thomas? Ooops! </seg>
<seg id="777"> It's so cool in here! </seg>
<seg id="778"> Everyone who wants to find you, I get cold. </seg>
<seg id="779"> STARNUTLSCE See? </seg>
<seg id="780"> I already have inflammatory bronchi. </seg>
<seg id="781"> If you do not spend the time walking all naked ... </seg>
<seg id="782"> But I'm Venus, I have to be naked. </seg>
<seg id="783"> It's part of the laVoro. </seg>
<seg id="784"> Do not you want to take away those ruinous rumors and come close to me? </seg>
<seg id="785"> There is so much place here under my fur. </seg>
<seg id="786"> No thanks. </seg>
<seg id="787"> I brought this for you, directly from the Olympus. </seg>
<seg id="788"> It's Daddy! </seg>
<seg id="789"> - Do not you see the label? Made in Olimpo. Because? </seg>
<seg id="790"> Why would I be interested in yours? </seg>
<seg id="791"> I know your little foul. </seg>
<seg id="792"> Women are not interested in you. </seg>
<seg id="793"> You are interested in their fur, you should marry an ottoman. </seg>
<seg id="794"> I'd better understand it with an otters than with a woman. </seg>
<seg id="795"> But if I put my legs under my waist ... </seg>
<seg id="796"> Would you like a little love? </seg>
<seg id="797"> Is it a bit of love you suggest to me? </seg>
<seg id="798"> No, it's the power you care about. </seg>
<seg id="799"> - Do you resist me? - Yes, yes. </seg>
<seg id="800"> Séférin, I want you on the floor, at my feet. </seg>
<seg id="801"> - You'll suppl. - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="802"> You already belong to me and you will belong to me until the end of time. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - Yeah. - (in German) Arriead. </seg>
<seg id="804"> I'll be back. </seg>
<seg id="805"> And then, puff, disappears. </seg>
<seg id="806"> Wow! - Mica male, eh? </seg>
<seg id="807"> - Yeah, no ... - She could scribble her and put her in the pièce. </seg>
<seg id="808"> Here, so to speak, yes. </seg>
<seg id="809"> - In this view ... - It's a little bit of a stress on Dietrich. </seg>
<seg id="810"> Yes, it works very well. </seg>
<seg id="811"> And then he gives a picture of Kushemski. </seg>
<seg id="812"> Yes, in the middle of the night is there that makes it difficult with Venus ... </seg>
<seg id="813"> And then the next morning with Vanda: "Do me yours, I beg you." </seg>
<seg id="814"> We could end by lowering the lights ... </seg>
<seg id="815"> .. and then when we get up there is morning, toc toc ... </seg>
<seg id="816"> Here comes Venus re-emerged from Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="817"> - For revenge. - But yes, it's great! </seg>
<seg id="818"> So is she you? - Thing? </seg>
<seg id="819"> Him and her? </seg>
<seg id="820"> Kushemski - Noavacek, Noavacek - Kushemski. </seg>
<seg id="821"> - No, it's not me. She said there's a lot of her there in there. </seg>
<seg id="822"> Then maybe she is Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="823"> - The pièce has nothing to do with me. - Of course, she's just the author. </seg>
<seg id="824"> Ops, the adapter. </seg>
<seg id="825"> Type: "If a critic says this is me, I kill him." </seg>
<seg id="826"> - Will I have the right to persuade the characters? - Sure. </seg>
<seg id="827"> Looks like you've come across the characters of a sadomaso novel. </seg>
<seg id="828"> No, it's a famous book and I ... </seg>
<seg id="829"> Have not experienced his "unforeseen time" at the age of twelve? </seg>
<seg id="830"> - No. - In library ... </seg>
<seg id="831"> - No! - With a cat. </seg>
<seg id="832"> No. </seg>
<seg id="833"> Is he still waiting for his "big time"? </seg>
<seg id="834"> I'm not expecting anything! </seg>
<seg id="835"> I find that the relationship between the two characters is fascinating, complex. </seg>
<seg id="836"> - Of course! - I love the emotional depth of the characters. </seg>
<seg id="837"> There is no such thing nowadays. </seg>
<seg id="838"> You no longer hate this kind of anger today. </seg>
<seg id="839"> - Let me introduce some of my friends. - Okay. </seg>
<seg id="840"> Very well, then I do not understand a good accident. </seg>
<seg id="841"> When he comes home, does his girlfriend not tie her to bed to frustrate her? </seg>
<seg id="842"> No. </seg>
<seg id="843"> She should ask him so much to see if the girlfriend is available. </seg>
<seg id="844"> - Stop calling her "the girlfriend." - Excuse me. </seg>
<seg id="845"> What do you think of the pièce its half? </seg>
<seg id="846"> - You do not like him very much. - You will have to be afraid that you say it is ìi. </seg>
<seg id="847"> It's not about us. </seg>
<seg id="848"> Let me tell you about her ... </seg>
<seg id="849"> Marie-Cécile. </seg>
<seg id="850"> I bet it's more fun than her. </seg>
<seg id="851"> Good extraction. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Surely she grew up in a beautiful family home in the province. </seg>
<seg id="853"> - From the parts of La Baule? - Nantes, actually. </seg>
<seg id="854"> But I bet her family spent the weekends at La Baule ... </seg>
<seg id="855"> In a beautiful garden yard. </seg>
<seg id="856"> Practice it laughs and loves the seafood. </seg>
<seg id="857"> Yes, it is not. </seg>
<seg id="858"> It is high, slightly authoritarian, but without being sided. </seg>
<seg id="859"> Deep-haired hair ... </seg>
<seg id="860"> ..longs legs and a nice pair ... </seg>
<seg id="861"> Eyes. </seg>
<seg id="862"> A mind of all respect. </seg>
<seg id="863"> He did the preparatory school in Paris, or Louis Le Grand. </seg>
<seg id="864"> Do I have a lot of mistakes? </seg>
<seg id="865"> Henry IV, School of Economics. - And she has a doctorate. </seg>
<seg id="866"> - He's finishing his thesis in sociology. - He has a dog? </seg>
<seg id="867"> Let's see a little ... I would say a labrador. </seg>
<seg id="868"> Is called... </seg>
<seg id="869"> It has an unusual name that makes a little intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="870"> - Bourdieu? - He'll go. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Culture is not lacking, I see. </seg>
<seg id="872"> I bet it's rich in breakthrough ... </seg>
<seg id="873"> Even if a tearful theater and a Belgian cactus ... </seg>
<seg id="874"> ... does not exactly Comédie Française. </seg>
<seg id="875"> No, there is family grain. Am I right? </seg>
<seg id="876"> Of course I say good. </seg>
<seg id="877"> But she is the artist and this in Marie-Cécile is losing her head ... </seg>
<seg id="878"> .. along with her sensitivity. </seg>
<seg id="879"> She is the first man she met ... </seg>
<seg id="880"> .. who has a feeling of being. </seg>
<seg id="881"> He loves books, opera, ballet, things like that. </seg>
<seg id="882"> In the evening, look at Arté and talk about the last Goncourt ... </seg>
<seg id="883"> .. and then do a quiet fuck. </seg>
<seg id="884"> Nothing is better than a quiet spit to relax. </seg>
<seg id="885"> But there's a rumor that rumors her head ... </seg>
<seg id="886"> He asks you to claim other things. </seg>
<seg id="887"> I do not know what it is, but it bumps. </seg>
<seg id="888"> Bum. </seg>
<seg id="889"> Bum. </seg>
<seg id="890"> Bum. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Meanwhile, Thomas is happy. </seg>
<seg id="892"> The girls are very well ... </seg>
<seg id="893"> .. and you'll spend a quiet night watching Arté ... </seg>
<seg id="894"> .. and to talk about the last Goncourt. </seg>
<seg id="895"> You will have children who will just like you and then you will die. </seg>
<seg id="896"> Do we keep reading? </seg>
<seg id="897"> Yes, we continue. </seg>
<seg id="898"> The next day's meeting in the birch forest? - All right. </seg>
<seg id="899"> We pretend it's the statue of Venus. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Aye, Aphrodite. </seg>
<seg id="901"> A, Aphrodite ... </seg>
<seg id="902"> Do we hesitate to read the text? </seg>
<seg id="903"> Well, Séerd. </seg>
<seg id="904"> No, no, that's fine. </seg>
<seg id="905"> All these stories of slavery and domination ... </seg>
<seg id="906"> She has corrupted me with all these speeches. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I'm convinced that she would love to dominate a man. </seg>
<seg id="908"> - No. - Maybe even torture him. </seg>
<seg id="909"> - No. - He admits it. </seg>
<seg id="910"> It's not from me. </seg>
<seg id="911"> - How can I reason? - The devil is the reason! </seg>
<seg id="912"> Séäin, you do not understand? </seg>
<seg id="913"> She will never be safe in the hands of a woman ... </seg>
<seg id="914"> ..what she is. </seg>
<seg id="915"> But this joke is sexist. I want to scream! </seg>
<seg id="916"> What is sexist? </seg>
<seg id="917"> "She will never be safe in the hands of a woman." </seg>
<seg id="918"> - But it's in the book ... - It does not change anything. </seg>
<seg id="919"> - The book is sexist. - The book is not sexist. </seg>
<seg id="920"> - On the contrary, it's something ... - A classic of world literature. </seg>
<seg id="921"> - Are you saying this? - Not exactly. </seg>
<seg id="922"> And this? </seg>
<seg id="923"> We do not have a Titian here, my dear. </seg>
<seg id="924"> - It's a pretty sadmouth porn. - But what ...? </seg>
<seg id="925"> - This story is nothing but a big cliché. - And why? </seg>
<seg id="926"> Is one spanked and suddenly loves to whip it? </seg>
<seg id="927"> - That's what happened to the author. - And it happened to her too? - No! </seg>
<seg id="928"> So what do you know? </seg>
<seg id="929"> For me it is a piece of two people that are united for eternity. </seg>
<seg id="930"> Their hearts are handcuffed to each other. </seg>
<seg id="931"> - Handled in perversion. - No, handcuffed in passion. </seg>
<seg id="932"> - Yes, but his passion! - It's chemical ... </seg>
<seg id="933"> .. is the meeting of two people who give fire to the polveri. </seg>
<seg id="934"> This is a fight of the sexes, of classes. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Vanda is an innocent woman who faces a pervert. </seg>
<seg id="936"> - But then he does not understand anything! - Vanda says: "She has corrupted me!" </seg>
<seg id="937"> And if the thirst for domination had sunk in her? </seg>
<seg id="938"> Had Kushemski been awakened? </seg>
<seg id="939"> What if she was just a woman? </seg>
<seg id="940"> This text looks like an Austrian misogyny brochure. </seg>
<seg id="941"> He obliges him to play a power and puts him in charge. </seg>
<seg id="942"> - That's not so. - That's right. </seg>
<seg id="943"> - And how? - You think in the end. - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Vanda tells the Greek to whip it ... </seg>
<seg id="945"> .. then leave Kushemski there with his cock in his hand ... </seg>
<seg id="946"> .. and would it be his fault even if he was to defeat him? </seg>
<seg id="947"> No, I think the little Kushemski has the potions for the Greek. </seg>
<seg id="948"> I wonder how it can be bitten up to this point. </seg>
<seg id="949"> How can Vanda interpret it so well ... </seg>
<seg id="950"> ..but be banged up to this point? </seg>
<seg id="951"> Fucking actress fucking! </seg>
<seg id="952"> That bastards! </seg>
<seg id="953"> Fuck! </seg>
<seg id="954"> - I'm sorry. - Excuse me? </seg>
<seg id="955"> I'm sorry, I was dragged. </seg>
<seg id="956"> Yes, but what is said is said. </seg>
<seg id="957"> We say that the meaning of pièce is "beware of your desires" </seg>
<seg id="958"> Since she could knock on her door ... </seg>
<seg id="959"> .. do not take a goddam her ass: here is the argument of the pièce ... </seg>
<seg id="960"> ..just saying. </seg>
<seg id="961"> Just saying. </seg>
<seg id="962"> What is the modern way of saying "so to speak"? </seg>
<seg id="963"> "Guy". </seg>
<seg id="964"> If she says it. </seg>
<seg id="965"> Much worse than the goddesses do not exist otherwise she would be in the shit. </seg>
<seg id="966"> All right, he's right. </seg>
<seg id="967"> All he says is okay. </seg>
<seg id="968"> Can we ... can we continue? </seg>
<seg id="969"> For fate, Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="970"> Do not you understand that you will never be safe in a woman's hands? </seg>
<seg id="971"> Whoever she is. </seg>
<seg id="972"> We are two avenues, Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="973"> We explore the limits of human nature. </seg>
<seg id="974"> She is sick. </seg>
<seg id="975"> It was denied by the countess, now its effects are affected. </seg>
<seg id="976"> - But she loves the effects like me. - Well ... </seg>
<seg id="977"> - He likes to have complete power over me. - No. </seg>
<seg id="978"> His desires will be orders. </seg>
<seg id="979"> I would supplant it, I would strike at her feet. </seg>
<seg id="980"> Do me what you want. </seg>
<seg id="981"> You are a crazy, a fanatic. </seg>
<seg id="982"> He is willing to do anything to accomplish his dream. </seg>
<seg id="983"> - But my dream is you. - Get away from me, Sérecier. </seg>
<seg id="984"> Before it's too late. </seg>
<seg id="985"> - She loves Me? - I do not know. </seg>
<seg id="986"> Decide, do something to convince her. </seg>
<seg id="987"> - And how? - Do what everyone loves. </seg>
<seg id="988"> - Let me suffer. - This disgusts me. </seg>
<seg id="989"> And I did not pretend to pretend. </seg>
<seg id="990"> I'm not the countess, her aunt. I am myself. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Repeat the challenge, challenges. </seg>
<seg id="992"> I'm not the countess, her aunt. I am myself. </seg>
<seg id="993"> - Still, get angry! - What do you want from me, Thomas? </seg>
<seg id="994"> I'm not her aunt fucking, I'm me! What do you want? </seg>
<seg id="995"> - I do not know. - At this time it is no longer a matter of pièce. </seg>
<seg id="996"> - I want a lot more. - But I'm not her. </seg>
<seg id="997"> I'm just a little bitch who needs to laurel. </seg>
<seg id="998"> And I'm not her aunt, I'm me. That's right? </seg>
<seg id="999"> Yes, that's fine. Very well. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> I can not do this part. It's too hard. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> Do not be afraid, for a lieutenant. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> Say "I beg you". </seg>
<seg id="1003"> I beg you. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> - She's awful. - I'm completely in his power. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> Lieutenant, you're not in my power, I'm in his hands. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> He says he is my slave but she is the one who dominates me. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> - Is not that right? - Thing? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> He does not stop saying that she has the power but he has it. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> The more he submits the more domination. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> It's complex, yes. </seg>
<seg id="1011"> Here is the contract we talked about. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> She determines that she agrees to make the most total submissive. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> It will be my slave. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> He will completely renounce his identity. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> His body, his soul, his honor will belong to me. </seg>
<seg id="1016"> Forever. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> Sign in at the bottom. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> Well? </seg>
<seg id="1019"> I believe my commitment would last a year. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> - Do you want to dictate my conditions? - Can I re-read the contract? </seg>
<seg id="1021"> Why, do not you trust me maybe? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Sign. </seg>
<seg id="1023"> Good. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> From now on you will call me lady ... </seg>
<seg id="1025"> .. and you will only speak when I will authorize you. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> You will serve me meals and wait for my orders in the corridor. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> In the morning you will be victorious and you will fall in the evening. </seg>
<seg id="1028"> I'll poke your stockings and put on your shoes. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> - I'll call you Thomas. - It's Gregoir in the text. </seg>
<seg id="1030"> I changed it. From now on, I'll call you Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> You will wear the diya's home with my coat of arms. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> - How much gentleman ... - Keep the word out. </seg>
<seg id="1033"> Did not you sign a contract to make sure you're my slave? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> - Your slave but not your servant. - The difference escapes me. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> - Is this a game? - That's what I am. </seg>

<seg id="1118"> In your opinion? </seg>
<seg id="1119"> I think I did not like that I answered the phone. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> Type "Female Nurse"? Or something like that? </seg>
<seg id="1121"> Something like this, yes. </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Any other director would have jumped on me. </seg>
<seg id="1123"> - I'm not "any other director". - Bullshit. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> If he thought he could do it, he would already have done it. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> It is not. </seg>

<seg id="1162"> I could almost fall in love with you when I was with you. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> "Almost fall in love"? This means you do not love me! </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I'm bored, whining constantly. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> Is the Count? And he? </seg>
<seg id="1166"> Are you in love with him? </seg>
<seg id="1167"> He followed me to Florence! </seg>

<seg id="1207"> You open a nuevo in front of you, to us. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> We're just us. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> We and his friend, Count. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> Stop bothering me about him. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> I do not punish you enough, here's the problem. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> Just when they have to take you in your arms. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> Are you standing for ... anyway? </seg>
<seg id="1214"> Come. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Come here. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Get in your arms. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> See? </seg>
<seg id="1218"> For an hour I'll let you imagine being free. </seg>
<seg id="1219"> In the end you will understand that you are what I want. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> An animal. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> An object. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> A space to fill. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> No, I will not allow it. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> - I do not want to, I refuse. - I apologize? </seg>
<seg id="1225"> - I wrote her a letter. - A letter? </seg>
<seg id="1226"> A goodbye letter, maybe. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> Is the degradation that you've been forced to make is already unbearable? </seg>
<seg id="1228"> The degradation that we ... </seg>
<seg id="1229"> I can not recite this passage. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> - I do not understand what's happening. - How would that be? </seg>
<seg id="1231"> Yet it's fairly clear. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> What do I have to do? In your head how do you spell the scene? </seg>
<seg id="1233"> But is the time when ... What was the joke? </seg>
<seg id="1234"> - "I wrote a letter to you." - A letter... </seg>
<seg id="1235"> A goodbye letter, maybe? </seg>
<seg id="1236"> - The degradation you deserve ... - Give it a little. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> Is the degradation that I have been forced to make you unbearable? </seg>
<seg id="1238"> Have to hear her on a few days ... </seg>
<seg id="1239"> I will be afraid to show you. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> Then? Doν'è? </seg>
<seg id="1241"> Show me this captain. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> A bit of veneration would not hurt me. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> That's fine, Tom. You are strong. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> You should do Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> No, no ... </seg>
<seg id="1246"> But yes! </seg>
<seg id="1247"> Have to be Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> You understand his character better than me, you created it ... </seg>
<seg id="1249"> You know her intimately. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> - But I do not know his jokes. - Yes you know. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> - Be careful, Séverin. - I do my best, master. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> But as usual, your best is not up to you. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> - Take my fur. - Yes, my lord. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> She prepares a bottle of champagne and two cocktails. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> Count Alexander Alexis will come from moment to moment. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> - But master ... - If you do not mind, you can leave. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> Far from my drive. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> His fur, mistress. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> Will Count Alexis marry you, mistress? </seg>
<seg id="1260"> I will not lie anymore, Sérecier. That man makes me tremble. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> Great! </seg>
<seg id="1262"> Wait! </seg>
<seg id="1263"> Sit down. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> I live in my thoughts, I can not throw it away. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> I live in my thoughts, I can not throw it away. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> - It makes me suffer. - You are great. </seg>
<seg id="1267"> - Yet I love this suffering. - Get up and stay a bit more. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> If he asks me to sue his wife, I'll say yes. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> You're magic. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Do you know he is very jealous of you? </seg>
<seg id="1271"> I told him everything about us two. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> And he probably threatened to kill her. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> In the effects ... </seg>
<seg id="1274"> - Count you hit her? Yup. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> - Did you let her go? Yes and it was sublime. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> More intense. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> - Yes and it was sublime. - Even more intense. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> - Blow it in your face. - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> And it was sublime. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> - Oh! - I'll kill you, both of you. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> I will tear your heart, throw it to the dogs! </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Let her be damned! </seg>
<seg id="1283"> - Damn it! Yeah, I'm killing Sérecier! </seg>
<seg id="1284"> I can not do this comedy anymore. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> Which comedy? </seg>
<seg id="1286"> But how does he love me? I was terrible with her. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> I did everything to get her out ... </seg>
<seg id="1288"> To heal it, to show you how much I love it. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> Was there nothing wrong with it? </seg>
<seg id="1290"> Anything. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Was it just a game? A recital? And the contract? </seg>
<seg id="1292"> Oh, the contract ... </seg>
<seg id="1293"> My little, tender, silly ... </seg>
<seg id="1294"> Séäin, I loved her from the first moment. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> I can not tell you why I'm not who she believes. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I'm weak, I'm lost ... do not you understand? </seg>
<seg id="1297"> Not bad. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> It's me that I should be submissive. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> It's me that I should be frustrated and tied up. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> I think I'll tie you to the statue with a pair of your socks. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> It's what you want, do not you? - Yes, I beg you. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> Do me what you want. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> - She promises never to leave me. - I will never leave you, I swear to you. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Ln feet. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> The hands? </seg>
<seg id="1306"> I dream this time since I met her. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> Stronger, even stronger. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> We humbled ourselves. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> You mortify me, sit down, I beg you. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> Very well, Tom. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> It's okay. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> Is fantastic. But do you know what the problem is? </seg>
<seg id="1313"> Whatever we say, or do, this piece is degrading. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> It's an insult to women. It's pornography. </seg>
<seg id="1315"> - What are you saying? - A bridesmaid in trouble ... </seg>
<seg id="1316"> ... a little bastard with no defenses humiliating himself by a man: </seg>
<seg id="1317"> "Punch me, make me sick, I'm just a woman." </seg>
