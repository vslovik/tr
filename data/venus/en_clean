MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND

THUNDER
3
No, no. This does not exist!
4
A young sexy guy who knows how to express himself...
5
..classical training with a vague talent and just a bit 'of the brain in the head.'
6
Not one who knows how to pronounce "inextricable"...
7
.. without having done a course in diction.
8
Well ', listen... THUNDER
9
(Marie-Cécile) Why do you say that? Turn to some agent.
10
These actresses, young and brave. - Yes  I can handle it.
11
At that time a woman was married at Vanda's age...
12
.. had five children and had come down with tuberculosis.
13
Instead today all girls talk like they're ten years old...
14
.. and have breathed helium: "Too, too cool!"
15
"It's one thing that rocks!"
16
I have a parade of more than thirty bitches...
17
..Half dressed as bitches and the other half as lesbians.
18
Vanda or I would be better than most of those girls.
19
Just put on a dress and a pair of socks you're done.
20
Hello? Hello, darling?
21
Oh, damn... Hello?
22
- Fuck! (Vanda) Knock, knock.
23
I arrived late, right? Oh shit!
24
Holy shit! - If you are coming for "Venus in Fur"...
25
.. everyone left half an hour ago.
26
I'm sorry, but I was on the other side of Paris.
27
My phone was charging, I broke a heel...
28
.. on one of those ventilation grilles that no one knows where they are.
29
And then there was a guy on the subway who rubbed himself on me...
30
.. Everything's this way.
31
And finally, the storm came. I'm soaked to the bone!
32
Holy cow, it's my day.
33
Holy shit bitch!
34
Maybe there's a Valium in the medicine cabinet, want to look?
35
No, it's just my luck.
36
Thank you, Lord, for making my life easier.
37
By the way, let me introduce myself.
38
- Vanda Jourdain. - Who? Vanda?
39
Do you understand?
40
I even have the right name.
41
Do you know a lot of girls who call themselves "Vanda"?
42
I was made for that part...
43
.. and she takes the subway stop in the tunnel with the turn.
44
- And your name is? - Thomas Novachek.
45
Pleasure... Hey, wait a minute!
46
- You are the author. - Yes, well... no.
47
I did the script.
48
- Yes, but you are also the director, right? - Yes, I would say yes.
49
I love your work at least the ones I know.
50
"Anatomy of a shadow," great! I saw it twice!
51
Not me.
52
Oh! But that was stupid.
53
- I meant that other one. - What other? - What a shame.
54
However, this one is too radical, at least from what I've read.
55
And rather risqué, right? Sexy in my opinion.
56
Or erotic, kind if you like humiliation and stuff like that.
57
I do not usually go around dressed in leather wearing a dog collar...
58
.. I'm a reserved type.
59
But I thought that I would help me get into the part.
60
- It's S & M stuff? - Not exactly.
61
- It's set in 1870. - Ah, I see.
62
- Not much of this in 1870, right? - No, not really.
63
- Perhaps the sadomasochistic ones dressed like this. - Yeah, I'll go find out.
64
- I brought a photo and a resume. - Very well, thank you.
65
Where are they? Here...
66
- Here's the picture... and the script. - Thank you.
67
True, it's a bit short but I was made for this part.
68
I starred in Hedda Gabbler and they said I was fabulous.
69
- The Theatre of the urinal? - Yes
70
I have not had the pleasure of following their last season.
71
You had an appointment for this audition?
72
At 2 pm or 3... a little 'time ago.
73
- Vanda... what did you say? - Jourdain?
74
Everyone always asks me if it's a stage name.
75
I don't see your name here.
76
Really? My agent swore that it was all right.
77
- I'm not on the list? - Please, leave.
78
Fuck! Well, thanks, sir.
79
- But since I'm here... - Wait, what does?
80
I also know the scene!
81
- No! - Wait!
82
- I even have a costume. - It's useless.
83
- You don't want me to audition? - I do not want to do it. No!
84
- Since I'm here we might try. - They're all gone.
85
- There is no one to run your lines. - You can do it.
86
For me it would be an honor to have the author do the scene with me.
87
- The author. - Fantastic!
88
- Directly from the author. - Okay, stop!
89
- To tell the truth, Miss... - Vanda.
90
- Try something different. - Oh yeah?
91
- Who do you want? - Someone a bit more...
92
.. how to say...
93
Okay, don't try so hard. Someone who is not me.
94
Too short, too tall, too old, too young...
95
My resume is too short, okay I understand.
96
- But no, wait. - I've pissed you off.
97
- Calm down. - It's not fair.
98
Really, I've had enough.
99
My day was a nightmare.
100
You can arrange other auditions.
101
I'm here now, I'd avoid having to come back tomorrow.
102
Even my day was very stressful too.
103
I auditioned an army of failures.
104
One even had braces on her teeth.
105
- Now would not be the time. - Okay. - I need to rest.
106
- Then I'll have some for dinner. - Yes, I understand.
107
It will be better to do it when I'm less tired.
108
Thank you for coming and congratulations on the dress.
109
- I'll see you soon. - I wish it were so, but it's nice to say it.
110
You look like a decent person.
111
This is a shitty job...
112
.. not to mention the thirty euros for this shitty costume.
113
- Do not you find this face "1800 something"? - Of course!
114
- It is very Vanda, right? - Very lovely.
115
I think wearing a dress this long...
116
.. because at that time everyone hated asses.
117
- This is a misstatement. - I see how it is.
118
CELLPHONE RINGS Please, be nice!
119
- Yes? - Thank you.
120
Oh, I must have lost track of the time.
121
No, no!
122
I am not speaking to you, someone has just came in.
123
No, No. I don't know.
124
Then I'll take the sushi just get takeout.
125
Hello.
126
Can you help me close it?
127
Thomas Novachek in person will give me the lines.
128
It won't be much help, I'm not an actor.
129
Come on, you're perfect. You'll crush Kowalski.
130
- No, Kushemski. - Kushemski.
131
- You are Kushemski. - OK, all done.
132
At your service, sir.
133
Where do we start? You choose. I don't care..
134
Let's try the first scene.
135
Okay.
136
- It has its fair share? - Yes
137
- It's a bit the worse for wear. - Is that the full text?
138
- Who gave it to you? - I don't know.
139
- I got it from my agent. - And where did he get it?
140
Is this a problem? Is it top secret? Should not I see it?
141
It's not important.
142
- Have you read it? - Yes, in passing, on the subway.
143
I have seen that is adapted from something.
144
From a song by Lou Reed "Venus in furs?"
145
No, it is taken from a novel by an Austrian author
146
"The Venus in Fur" by Leopold von Sacher Masoch.
147
I bet you know how to read Austrian and have read it in the original version.
148
Actually yes.
149
The book caused a scandal when it was published in 1870.
150
I believe it! It's a porn BDSM.
151
- This is not a porn BDSM. - You don't think it's porn?
152
Not even a little?
153
Since it was written in the Middle Ages, in 1800 or something?
154
"Venus in Fur" is a beautiful love story...
155
It's a masterpiece. It's one of the great texts of world literature.
156
Ah, yes? For me, it's a porno.
157
Sadomasochism, I know what it is, I work in the theater.
158
The term "masochism" comes from Sacher-Masoch and from this book.
159
Ah! Masochism-Masoch. I get it!
160
So this guy has given his name to sadomasochism.
161
- It was not his intention. - I see.
162
He believed he had written a good novel and they all said it was porn.
163
- You have plagiarized the book? - No, I adapted it.
164
I reinvented the dialogue, the situations and...
165
- There is so much of me in here. - Great!
166
Genius! Where does it take place?
167
In a hotel that is located on a remote mountain in the eastern part of...
168
.. the Imperial Austro-Hungarian Empire. - Let me remember.
169
- It's complicated. - It's a nice place?
170
Yes, it is a spa for wealthy people...
171
.. a luxurious place.
172
The curtain rises and Kushemski is in his room.
173
He is reading his book while drinking coffee.
174
And then... knock knock! Cue Vanda.
175
It is symbolic from the point of view of the character?
176
No, but there are still people who read the book.
177
- Sometimes even the real book, on paper. - Ah, you caught me.
178
This fellow, what's his name? Sevran, Severan, Savrìne ..
179
- Severin Von Kushemski. - That's it.
180
What kind of person is he?
181
Tell me some adjectives.
182
Rich, idle, typical of his era, smart traveler, cultured.
183
- An intellectual.
184
- So to speak. - Ah, "so to speak." I love it.
185
- I haven't heard anyone talk like that in a long time. - I wouldn't know.
186
- So she is a distinct type? - You want me to talk about the character?
187
Yes, I know it by heart... but yes, please, if you like!
188
I would say that from many points of view she is a young woman of her time...
189
.. in spite of the principles she professes, but...
190
- In spite of what? Of the principles she professes.
191
At first glance she is a person in place, poised and very cultured.
192
As you say! Anything else?
193
Something that I do not already know?
194
Never mind, I'll manage.
195
- Will it bother you if I change lighting? - The lighting!
196
It's a bit' too much, don't you think?
197
Please, make yourself at home.
198
Is that better?
199
Not bad.
200
Wait.
201
I don't know how to work that.
202
OK. That's much better.
203
I guess this is the sofa.
204
Yes, it's the sofa.
205
A desk?
206
The book that is discussed?
207
There is a postcard, fantastic!
208
What is this?
209
- A phallic symbol? - There are remnants of the previous show.
210
A Belgian production of...
211
.. "Stagecoach" adapted to musical comedy.
212
Where would you like me to stand?
213
Where do you prefer...
214
.. less at the center.
215
Side yard? - Garden.
216
You want to re-read the text before you start?
217
No, let's begin. Up to where?
218
- End of page three. - Okay. And then throw me out, right?
219
- You want me to to try? - And then throw me out.
220
- Look, I... Ah, yes! I forgot...
221
- The phrase that on the first page, The citation.  The epigraph?
222
Yes, that one.
223
"The Lord Almighty struck him and put him in the hands of a woman."
224
Is a quote that appears in the novel, It's taken from the Book of Judith.
225
It's in the Bible? - In the Apocryphal books of the Bible, yes.
226
I do not know anything about that.
227
- Ah, yes. Don't you think it's sexist?
228
"The Lord Almighty struck him and put him in the hands of a woman."
229
I just mentioned the novel of Sacher-Masoch.
230
Yes, but since you put it on page zero...
231
It does not matter, does not concern me, I'm just an actress. But you...
232
Forgot the fur!
233
- She's wearing a stole, right? - Yes, indeed.
234
Fur, fur...
235
soft fur...
236
Maybe not...
237
This...
238
Good...
239
(she begins voice warmups) The socks are dry and the Duchess is arch-dry.
240
The socks are dry and the Duchess is arch-dry.
241
Ka ke ke ke. Ka ke ke ke.
242
- When you're ready. - "The tea has cured your stubborn cough?"
243
"If you will not leave the role."
244
(Blows rasberries)
245
Toc toc. - She enters.
246
Herr Doktor von Severin Kushemski?
247
I'm sorry if I'm bothering you.
248
My name is Vanda von Dunayev.
249
I am in the room above you.
250
Last night I found this book, a copy of "Faust"...
251
.. with your bookmark inside.
252
I was sitting under the birches, near the statue of Venus.
253
Thank you very much.
254
I had just asked the waitress to look for it..
255
I found it and there is a postcard inside.
256
This is a Titian, right?
257
Yes
258
"Venus in the mirror," one of my favorite paintings.
259
Your Venus looks to be well used...
260
.. just like your book.
261
She is faithful?
262
- Excuse me? - Original?
263
Yes, it is a copy... faithful to the original.
264
I understand your infatuation, it's a ravishing picture.
265
Thanks for having troubled to bring it back.
266
I could not help noticing the strange poem written on the back.
267
"Venus In Fur". Did you write it?
268
- Those are poor, poor verses. - Shoddy? really?
269
"To love and be loved, or as a charm..."
270
".. yet, stronger, more beautiful still .."
271
".. is this torment that consumes me."
272
"I will kiss this woman I am a victim..."
273
".. the slave miserable..."
274
".. submissive, the footrest."
275
"My goddess, my dictator..."
276
".. my Venus in Furs."
277
The sentiments are interesting.
278
If I were you, I'd take better care of this.
279
I appreciate your discretion.
280
Want to sit for a moment?
281
Thank you.
282
- May I take your coat? - Very kind of you.
283
This fur is a tartar, right?
284
A sable of the Caucasus? I would say of Kazakhstan.
285
Yes, a tartar sable from Kazakhistan, exactly.
286
Kushemski, standing, observes the fur between his hands.
287
But you are trembling Kushemski.
288
Yes, I pray you to forgive me.
289
- Can I get you something to drink? - Gladly.
290
- A coffee would be perfect. - Then take mine.
291
How kind!
292
- Two lumps, please. - He serves coffee...
293
I hope the noise above doesn't bother you when I walk in heels.
294
I'd give anything in the world.
295
To hear you walk so well in your heels.
296
So you're a poet, Herr Kuskhemski?
297
A waste of time.
298
And a passionate expert on fur?
299
The love of fur...
300
- Skip this measure, the following is ... - No, read it.
301
The love of fur is innate.
302
a passion given to all by nature.
303
Put in a little more effort.
304
The love of fur is innate.
305
a passion given to all by nature.
306
Caress a soft and thick fur...
307
.. hear that particular crackle, that electricity...
308
I think that it is not only a gift of nature.
309
Your mother wrapped you up in a sable when you were little?
310
But that's indiscreet.
311
I beg your pardon. - No, I...
312
It was one of my aunts who had a real passion for fur.
313
- So that explains it. - We are all easily explained.
314
- But we remain intractable. - Inextricable?
315
- What do you mean? - Life makes us what we are?
316
End of page three.
317
THUNDER
318
Actually yes...
319
- That was going very well, Vanda. - I was looking for footholds.
320
- I did what I could. - Seemed very solid.
321
That's what it means to be able to create an atmosphere.
322
- I am a professional. - Really, it was...
323
- Stop it, I'll blush. - I did not say it was perfect.
324
- No, of course. - Let's go on a little more.
325
Kushemski - After that he makes his big speech...
326
.. you go to...
327
- Read, it helps me to get into character. Please recite.
328
- You read well, Thomas. - No, it's an impression.
329
You read really well.
330
- Have you already thought of someone for Kushemski? - Not really.
331
- I have several options. - You could do it yourself.
332
- Yes, of course! - I think so seriously.
333
- You would be very good. - No, it's quite difficult.
334
- Does the director inflict this on all the actors? - It is his job.
335
- I'm directing for the first time. - Doesn't look like it.
336
I decided to do this because directors never understand anything.
337
- You have no idea what I have endured... - That's why it's perfect.
338
- You know what to do. - I have everything in my head.
339
I want to use the "Lyric Suite" by Alban Berg for the transitions...
340
- a great idea! - He knows the "Lyric Suite"?
341
No, but you understand what I mean?
342
You know the story of the inner life, of the characters, everything! - Yes.
343
What accent Kushemski should have...
344
.. or something of the kind. - He's a distinguished man.
345
Yes, distinguished - And with that, I don't know...
346
.. an aristocrat.
347
he moves like this...
348
Or is that just stupid?
349
a little. It's silly but it is fantastic.
350
- For this scene he would wear a dressing gown? - Yes
351
- You're joking! - Want to try it?
352
Buck up, I'll help.
353
But it is magnificent.
354
- Am I wrong or is it vintage? - So I'm told.
355
Siegfried Mueller...
356
.. Vienna...
357
.. 1869.
358
I hadn't seen that.
360
Seems tailor-made for him.
361
- How does it look? - Very good.
362
It is close to my size.
363
- You look great. - Yes
364
Hello, sweet guy.
365
And the dog collar?
366
It is a reminder of the period in which I beat the pavement.
367
Joke!
368
Let's pick up a few lines back.
369
Your mother wrapped you up in a sable when you were a little baby?
370
That was indiscreet, please forgive me.
371
It was one of my aunts who had a real passion for fur.
372
- For him it is tough to say this. - Yes, it's no wonder.
373
- Then take courage. - Yes
374
That was indiscreet, please forgive me.
375
It was one of my aunts who had a real passion for fur.
376
- So that explains it. - We are all easily explained.
377
But we remain inexplainable.
378
Inexplainable?
379
What do you mean?
380
Life makes us what we are in an unpredictable moment.
381
Is the coffee to your liking?
382
I just tasted it. It's excellent.
383
This is symbolic, right? The coffee is...
384
.. and she has just tasted but is already excited.
385
Ln fact, I was suprised.
386
Have you ever experienced such a surprising moment Mister Kushemski?
387
In reality, yes, but I will not bother you.
388
On the contrary, it fascinates me.
389
Like one of those English detective novels
390
He had a mysterious aunt who loved fur.
391
- We could skip this part. - No, read it. I want to hear it.
392
He had a mysterious aunt who loved fur.
393
I was a child from hell...
394
.. spoiled and cruel.
395
Mean to our maids and our cat.
396
I behaved very badly with one of my aunts.
397
The Countess was a woman majestic, voluptuous and terrible ..
398
- What is it? - Nothing.
399
just saying aloud the words that I wrote ...
400
.. two in the morning on a screen looked different.
401
You're doing great!
402
What did your aunt do?
403
One evening he is avenged.
404
She came into my room...
405
.. with her big black Russian fox coat
406
In her hand she held a rod, a branch of birch...
407
.. With her were the cook and the maid.
408
She took off her coat and she rolled up his sleeves...
409
.. I tried to escape...
410
.. but the other two women took hold of me,..
411
I lowered my pants and she threw me on the fur.
412
I held still while my aunt punished me with the rod.
413
My buttocks and my naked thighs were on fire.
414
The maid encouraged her.
415
She made fun of me, treated me like a sissy
416
I danced away but my aunt continued to hit me...
417
.. until such time as I begged her to stop...
418
.. out of pity.
419
When she finally stopped, she forced me to thank her...
420
.. and kiss her feet.
421
Then she left room threatening to come back.
422
And all this in the presence of the maids...
423
.. and our cat.
424
From that moment...
425
.. fur to me more than simple fur...
426
.. nor a birch branch a simple branch.
427
In a moment she made me who I am...
428
- And she came back? - Yes
429
In my dreams, with her black fur and her rod.
430
She comes to visit me again, night after night.
431
- My poor friend. Poor?
432
She taught me the most valuable thing in the world
433
- And what did she teach you? - That nothing is more sensual than pain.
434
That nothing is more exciting than degradation.
435
The Countess did her job well.
436
It has become my ideal.
437
From that day I seek her double.
438
And when I meet this woman I will marry her.
439
This step is sensational!
440
Thanks, it took a lot of work.
441
In practical terms, it's like a play child abuse?
442
It has nothing to do with it.
443
What the fuck does the maltreatment of children have to do with this story?
444
Holy cow, this craze nowadays...
445
.. bring everything to a social problem of cock.
446
- The abuse is not only... - Do not follow stereotypes!
447
Do not talk about anthropology or sociology!
448
- Let's make theater. - Yes, but...
449
Here there is much more at stake than the issue of corporal punishment.
450
Okay, I'm sorry!
451
Most of the world live impoverished and dull lives!
452
Why do we always try to bring everything to something else?
453
What else will we pull out now? sexism, racism, class struggle?
454
Well, you're certainly unique, Herr Kushemski.
455
If I were you, I would be careful.
456
Your ideal woman could prove more cruel than desired.
457
I am ready to take the risk.
458
I know what she is... A supersensual person.
459
An ascetic of pleasure.
460
And you, Frau von Vanda Dunayev, who or what are you?
461
I am a pagan.
462
Does that mean I'm young, beautiful, rich...
463
.. and by that account able to derive more benefits than possible to others.
464
I do not deny anything.
465
I have the utmost respect for your principles.
466
I beg your pardon, but I do not care for your respect.
467
I shall love the man in whom I take delight...
468
.. and take pleasure from the man who will make me happy...
469
.. but only until he ceases to make me happy and then I'll find another.
470
For a man there is no greater cruelty than the infidelity of a woman.
471
For a woman, it gets worse: forced loyalty.
472
- I can move? - Yes, yes... go ahead, move.
473
In our society...
474
woman can have power except through the intercession of a man.
475
What will become of the woman, when she becomes equal to men?
476
When she becomes herself?
477
The Little Vanda is way ahead of her time!
478
How do you know all the lines?
479
- I don't know. I learn quickly. - You know all the text by heart!
480
You had said that Vanda is very much in place in spite of what?
481
- Of the principles she professes. - There are those. - Yes
482
According to her Vanda does not believe in all these stories.
483
'what it says... Women's Rights, blah blah blah...
484
But she does, jerk7, She has character, a mind of her own.
485
As said: " the principles she professes" and not "her principles."
486
I think I very much liked the alliteration: "of the principles she professes."
487
I see!
488
He sold his soul for alliteration.
489
'true, I plead guilty.
490
Just between us, Thomas, she is a true tomboy.
491
If you allow, I would say that...
492
You are better than a pagan. Seems to me you are a goddess.
493
- Really? And what? - Venus.
494
And Vanda? Is Venus really me or am I making this up?
495
Venus took the likeness of a human to come to haunt him?
496
Not really.
497
- Or rather, not exactly. - Okay, it's so, and she wanted it.
498
- She wants it to be ambivalent. - Ambiguous. - Yes, that one.
499
In fact it is the story of "The Bacchae."
500
Exactly. What was "The Bacchae"?
501
- It's an old play, right? - It's a very old play.
502
"Citizens of Corinth. I stand before you a Testiculus...
503
.. a poor mortal cursed by the gods for his offenses...
504
.. and totally fucked up till the end of time."
505
- It's this kind of play? - Yes
506
Dionysus descends to Earth and is the arrogant king of Thebes...
507
A quivering jelly dressed as a woman. - It looks exciting.
508
After that, the wild women of Thebes The Bacchae, broke him in pieces.
509
- And Dionysus returns to his home, triumphant. - I think I saw it.
510
In our case, however, it is not Dionysus but Aphrodite.
511
Of course. Who is that?
512
- She is the Greek version of Venus. - But it is the same person.
513
The same goddess. - Hail Aphrodite!
514
Hail, oh Aphrodite. Am I unbearably pedantic?
515
Yes, but I find it cute.
516
Yes.
517
What do we do?
518
Seems to me a goddess...
519
Really? What?
520
Venus.
521
But Venus can rule only in a world of slaves.
522
Then I'd better find one.
523
Would you like to be my slave, Kushemski Herr Doktor?
524
I already am.
525
I became your slave the moment you entered this room.
526
Really? Are you already in love with me?
527
Deeply.
528
I am suffering as if I knew it all along.
529
- Submit to me. - Stand up straight and turn away from me.
530
I must confess this intrigues me.
531
I love your frankness and the clarity of your thought.
532
From a physical point of view, You have charms, no doubt.
533
But if a man submits himself to me, I set a trap...
534
I don't care about traps. Love me!
535
- You see? He has already begun to give orders. - Marry me!
536
I am a frivolous woman, Herr Kushemski.
537
To love me, you will have to give proof of great courage .
538
- I have already explained my principles. - I do not care.
539
- I want you to be my wife. - You do not know anything about me.
540
- I submit to you - That's absurd.
541
I'll give you complete power over me, for eternity.
542
Do with me what you wish.
543
- I submit, hit me if you want. - This is unexpected news to me.
544
- Let's try it a new way. - What way?
545
- Put yourself center stage upstage. - No, I'm fine here.
546
You should move there!
547
Take the power and stand in a position of power.
548
OK. Continue.
549
- This is unexpected news to me. - This isn't working.
550
Do not move, try it here.
551
I'll give you complete power over me for eternity, unconditionally.
552
Do with me what you want. I submit.
553
Hit me if you want.
554
- This is unexpected news to me. - You don't even pretend to try?
555
You wanted me to go here, So I went here.
556
It's just an audition.
557
I am listening also to see if you agree.
558
Do what I say and stay there.
559
I'll give you complete power over me for eternity, unconditionally.
560
Do with me what you want. I submit.
561
- You can hit me if you want. - This unexpected news to me.
562
- You're right, it's better. - Continue.
563
What do you want in the depths of your heart?
564
To belong to you...
565
.. to disappear in essence sublime...
566
.. to dress you and undress you...
567
.. to offer you stockings, to put on your shoes .. .
568
.. to no longer have my own will.
569
And that you call that love? - It's the only love there is.
570
In love, as in politics only one of the parties must have the power.
571
One must be the hammer and the other the anvil.
572
I gladly accept to be the anvil.
573
Enough.
574
Go on, I like it!
575
Thomas, you are intelligence, especially with regard to women.
576
- You really understand women. - Yes, yes... years of study.
577
- Where was I? - You are an anvil.
578
Vanda, I try my pain is your pleasure.
579
You should not ever let the feelings of others dominate.
580
The servant of his mistress lives to serve her.
581
I submit, squeeze me like a lemon.
582
You are incredible.
583
If you do not want me as a husband, take me as a slave.
584
Treat me with divine cruelty.
585
Why should I mistreat those who love me?
586
- But I'd love it even more. - I do not want to be adored.
587
All women want to be worshiped, as our Creator.
588
I am created! I am ruined! I am reduced to a thing!
589
CELLPHONE RINGS
590
One moment, please excuse me.
591
Hello? Yes
592
No, they are not out yet.
593
It's all right.
594
It's all good just...
595
I don't know.
596
At times, eh?
597
I'll call you when I get out?
598
Yeah, me too, my love.
599
- Yeah, so... Yes, all right.
600
Excuse me, huh?
601
You're not listening.
602
This time it's a temporary agency, maybe they have something for me?
603
A typist? Night work in a major law firm.
604
The contract is for tomorrow. Blah Blah Blah
605
I don't know!
606
What will be, will be.
607
That's life. That's life little one. Bye!
608
- Crazy! - Your better half?
609
You think so? - What did you call him?
610
- I don't know... asshole? - Ah, okay.
611
- You wonder why I lied to you? - No, it does not concern me.
612
Why do you say that Vanda?
613
"I do not deny anything, There are other fish in the sea."
614
- Why do you talk like that? - You're the hammer, he's the anvil.
615
What should I say? "Yes, dear, whatever you want"?
616
This has nothing to do with love, but with my ass.
617
If I say so, You have to take it.
618
- This is dialogue from the play. - Oh yeah?
619
You're making fun of me?
620
- I do not know, do you think I am? - Will you stop pretending.
621
For once I cannot tell what you are thinking.
622
Talking with you is more complicated than doing the tango.
623
Want to go for a coffee?
624
Why do you say that?
625
- You're hitting on me? - Absolutely not!
626
I'm just offering you a coffee.
627
- But it's symbolic coffee. - No, no, it's a real coffee.
628
What would she say if your wife saw you give me a "real coffee"?
629
- I'm not married. - Ah yes...
630
I thought so before the phone call.
631
- It was my fiancee. - It's the same thing.
632
You would think that? In an interview you said:
633
"The theater is the best way to get girls into bed."
634
Don't tell me that you read that stuff.
635
I was young, it was my first interview.
636
- You have never been married? - Never.
637
- You still live with your mother? - I'm weird, but not that weird.
638
I fox fur her passion?
639
- No, it's love. - She is really strange.
640
And I want my woman to be my muse.
641
So your girlfriend has a pair of wings and everything else?
642
In the vision of love one must jump completely in.
643
And she dives right in? - Yes, like a fish...
644
.. with fireworks, dizziness and thunder.
645
So, coffee yes? Or no coffee?
646
I can't conceive of a man giving me his life only by becoming my slave.
647
I would say that we are not at all compatible Herr Kushemski.
648
We will cancel each other out.
649
And I would say that we are made for each other.
650
Is that not what he feels, Vanda? Is not that what you feel?
651
I propose we try a contract, as in business.
652
You will have a year to prove you are the man I need.
653
- A year is a long time. - I have not finished yet.
654
- I beg your pardon. - You will be my slave for a year.
655
So you prepared everything.
656
You planned everything before entering here.
657
- Do you believe that? - Stop being naive.
658
- It's you, you're the author of this. - I'm not sure I had everything ready.
659
I'm being sincere, I swear.
660
So you wanted this? You seem ambivalent.
661
- Ambiguous. - That yes.
662
Or is it a slut you crave, ready to enjoy everything.
663
A craving whore? I had never thought of you as that.
664
It can be even more complicated.
665
"Be my slave for a year and then I'll let you fuck me."
666
- She is always ambivalent, right? - Ambiguous.
667
- Ambiguous. - From my point of view, rather than Kushemski's...
668
This could be his last chance. Maybe the only one.
669
And to do what?
670
- To live. - Ok, good.
671
He loves the whip and wants to know if she likes it too.
672
- He told her this? - She understands him.
673
He is a weirdo and she is an object, like all women of the 1800s.
674
What?
675
Who is she, then, Frau Vanda Jourdain?
676
- I am a pagan. - No, I'm serious.
677
Try again.
678
Where did you get this? What is your story?
679
Daughter of the military, grew up around soldiers, An orphan.
680
Where have you been? ln which cities and which countries?
681
I will write a contract stipulating that you will be my slave for a year.
682
- I'll be at your command. - Done deal.
683
Let's shake on it.
684
- There's a real Greek at the hotel. A Greek? - Yes
685
He's from Athens.
686
Mounts a stallion as white as snow wearing boots and black leather.
687
I want you to get me the number of his room.
688
- But, Vanda... What is it?
689
- Already reluctant to obey me? - I beg your pardon.
690
Tomorrow I'll wait in the birch forest, near the statue of Aphrodite.
691
- At what time? Wait for me until such time as I decide to come.
692
- Very good. - Don't come without the room number of the Greek.
693
Now kiss my foot.
694
And he kneels and kisses her foot.
695
I love this part, it is very direct.
696
Pass me my fur now.
697
S�verin, how will it end?
698
This depends only on you, Vanda Frau von Dunayev, not on me.
699
Thanks for the coffee, slave.
700
OK, I'm leaving right now. A coffee sounds good.
701
That was intense. The handshake was electric.
702
The happiness of a time when people were more introverted.
703
A simple conversation emanated eroticism.
704
Conversation. The only thing to put between your teeth.
705
The book begins like this, right?
706
- The book? - Yes
707
Where is the beginning scene...
708
.. when Venus appears to be naked wearing fur in front of the fireplace?
709
- You've read "The Venus in Furs"? - I looked it over.
710
When you said you did not know about it you lied.
711
OK, I lied a little.
712
- Why didn't you keep that scene? - I did not know how to use it.
713
Just put it at the beginning, before the guy with Vanda.
714
You can not think of doing "The Venus in Furs" without Venus.
715
You can use the same actress for Vanda and Venus.
716
- Naked on stage? That's no problem. - Yes, I'll think about it.
717
- Why don't we improvise? It'll give you some ideas. - How?
718
You have to change the lights.
719
- Where we are at the beginning of the play? - In Kushemski's room...
720
.. in the middle of the night.
721
Ok, middle of the night, two in the morning.
722
Let's turn them down a little...
723
Fire in the fireplace, side garden. There!
724
Yes, very well.
725
Kushemski What are you doing?
726
- I do not know... is he in bed? - What a fantasy!
727
Too obvious?
728
He is reading when he meets Vanda.
729
Do not read too early, we are not in the library.
730
Perhaps he could be writing in his diary.
731
I like that.
732
Yes
733
OK I'm Venus.
734
Ah shit, who cares?
735
Face me as if you were naked. - You're hitting on me?
736
Imagine that I'm your girlfriend and this is unexpected.
737
- Ah, it's the first time I've done this. - You say that to all the girls.
738
Yes, but for me it is the truth.
739
The fire in the fireplace comes to life, we see Venus naked...
740
.. lasciviously wrapped in a fur coat... - Uh huh
741
Now wrap me in fur.
742
You're the director.
743
I said "lascivious."
744
Now you go to the desk.
745
Become the character.
746
Write in his diary.
747
- Really write. - I'm doing it.
748
But out loud, we are in the theater! If not, how do we know who he is?
749
We are at the beginning of the play.
750
The scene is illuminated little by little...
751
We hear the ticking of a grandfather clock.
752
Tic tac...
753
.. tick...
754
.. tick...
755
..tic tac!
757
Two in the morning.
758
Living in a spa...
759
.. surrounded by forests and mountains.
760
It's a moonless night, darkness and silence reign.
761
(VANDA WHISTLING) A Moment! I hear a sparrow.
762
- A nightingale. - A nightingale.
763
VANDA MEOWS
764
And the cry of a cat in heat.
765
I feel terribly alone...
766
.. unhappy, unfulfilled.
767
(In German) Good evening Sir.
768
Well, the Germans have invaded again?
769
I hope I did not disturb you.
770
Absolutely not.
771
Hail, Aphrodite.
772
- So now you have not forgotten me? - Forget?
773
My most dear old enemy?
774
- You're too kind. - Yes
775
I do not have a right to a little kiss?
776
- That's better, but Thomas... - Oh! - I told Thomas? Oops!
777
It's so cold in here!
778
Every time I come to visit you, I am cold.
779
(SNEEZES) See?
780
I already catching a cold.
781
If you dodidn't pass the time walking around naked...
782
However, I am Venus, I have to be naked.
783
It is part of the job.
784
Do not you want to take off those rough clothes and come here and hold me close to you?
785
There is so much room here under my fur.
786
No, thank you.
787
I brought this vision to you, directly from Olympus.
788
It is divine!
789
- Do you not see the label? Made in Olympus.
790
Why should I care about your vision?
791
I know your small flaw.
792
You're not interested in women.
793
You just like their fur, should marry an otter.
794
I understand it better with an otter than with a woman.
795
But if I spread legs under my mink...
796
.. would you refuse a little love?
797
Is it t 'a little' love you suggest?
798
No, it is the power that interests you.
799
- Dare you resist me? - Yes, I dare.
800
Séférin, I want you on the ground, at my feet.
801
- Beg me. - Never.
802
You already belong to me and I will belong until the end of time.
803
- Never. - (In German) Goodbye my friend.
804
I'll be back.
805
And then, poof, she disappears.
806
Whew! - Not bad, eh?
807
- Not bad?... - You could write it down and put it in a play.
808
That's a good idea.
809
- In this context... - her accent could be like Marlene Dietrich.
810
Yes, that would work very well.
811
This gives a different picture of Kushemski.
812
Yes, in the middle of the night there is a vision of Venus...
813
.. and then the next morning with Vanda: "I saw her, I beg you."
814
We conclude by lowering the lights...
815
.. and then when you get up in the morning again comes knock, knock...
816
.. and then Venus reappears disguised as Vanda.
817
- To take revenge. - But yes, it's great!
818
So are you? - What?
819
Are you he?
820
Kushemski - Novacek, Novacek - Kushemski.
821
- No, not me. You said that there is a lot of you in there.
822
Then maybe you are Vanda?
823
- The play has nothing to do with me. - Sure, you're just the author.
824
Oops, the adapter.
825
Type: "If a critic says that that's me, kill him."
826
- I have the right to invent characters. - Of course adapter Novacek.
827
Just by chance you came across in the characters in a novel about sadomasochism.
828
No, it's a famous book and I...
829
Didn't you experience this "unpredictable moment" at the age of twelve?
830
- No. - ln the library...
831
- No! - With a cat.
832
No.
833
She's still waiting for your "big moment"?
834
It's not a damn bit like that!
835
I find the relationship between the two characters both fascinating and complex. Very rich.
836
- Of course! - I love the emotional depth of the characters.
837
Don't you see more of this kind of thing nowadays.
838
Don't you see more of this kind rage nowadays.
839
- I should submit it some friends of mine. - Okay.
840
Very well, then I don't understand anything about anything.
841
When you return home, your fiancee doesn't tie you to the bed and whip you?
842
No.
843
You should ask her and see if your fiancee will do it.
844
- Stop calling her "fiancee." - Excuse me.
845
Should I call her your better half?
846
- I don't like that very much. - Would you tell me if you were afraid?
847
This is not about us.
848
Let me guess about your...
849
Marie-Cécile.
850
Marie-Cécile. I bet she's younger than you.
851
Good deduction.
852
Definitely grew up in a nice little house a good family in Provence.
853
- I bet from La Baule. - Nantes, actually.
854
But I bet her family spent the weekend in La Baule...
855
.. in a beautiful villa with a garden.
856
She goes sailing and loves seafood.
857
Yes, it's true.
858
She is tall, slightly authoritarian, but without being disagreeable.
859
with wonderful hair...
860
.. Long legs and a nice pair of...
861
.. eyes.
862
A mind to be respected.
863
She went to preparatory school in Paris, of course to Louis Le Grand.
864
Am I wrong?
865
Henry IV, School of Economic Sciences - And she has a doctorate?
866
- She is finishing her thesis in sociology. - She has a dog?
867
Let's see... I would say a labrador.
868
It's called...
869
It has an unusual name that is a little 'intellectual.
870
- Bourdieu? - Derrida.
871
You are not lacking in culture I see.
872
I bet that she's a blonde...
873
.. she likes a small seedy theater and has a Belgian cactus...
874
.. Not exactly the Comédie Française.
875
No, there is taste in her family. Am I right?
876
Of course, I'm right. Good.
877
But she is an artist and you lost your head over this Marie-Cécile...
878
.. and her sensitivity.
879
"You're perhaps the first man I have ever met...
880
.. who has a real sensitivity."
881
She loves books, the opera, the ballet things like that.
882
In the evening, watch and talk about the Arts last Goncourt...
883
.. and then fuck quietly.
884
Nothing is better than a quiet sex session to relax.
885
But there's a voice that echoes in his head...
886
.. a voice that demands other things.
887
I do not know what it is but it echoes.
888
Boom.
889
Boom.
890
Boom.
891
In the meantime you are happy.
892
You truly, truly love her...
893
.. and spend a quiet life looking Arty...
894
.. and talking about the latest Goncourt.
895
You will have children who will live just like you and then you will die.
896
Shall we continue to read?
897
Yes, let's continue.
898
The meeting in the birch forest? - Okay.
899
Let's pretend that's the statue of Venus.
900
Hail, Aphrodite.
901
Hail, Aphrodite...
902
re-read the text quickly?
903
No, Séνerin.
904
No, no, this is not good.
905
All these stories of bondage and domination...
906
You have corrupted me with all this talk.
907
I am convinced that she would feel pleasure to dominate a man.
908
- No. - Maybe even to torture.
909
- No. - Admit it.
910
Not for me.
911
- How can I make you see reason? - To hell with reason!
912
Séνerin, do you really not understand?
913
You will never be safe in the hands of a woman...
914
.. whoever she is.
915
But this play is sexist. I want to yell!
916
What is so sexist?
917
"You will never be safe in the hands of a woman."
918
- But it's in the book... - you can't change anything?
919
- The book is sexist. - The book is not sexist.
920
- On the contrary, it is something... - A classic of world literature.
921
- That's what you were about to say? - Not exactly.
922
And this?
923
We do not have a certain Titian here, sweetheart.
924
- It's a nice BDSM porno. - What the...?
925
This story is nothing more than a big cliche. - And why is it a chiche?
926
He is spanked and suddenly he likes to be whipped?
927
- It's what happened to the author. - And it happened to you? - No!
928
Then what?
929
For me it is a play about two people who are united eternally.
930
their hearts are handcuffed to each other.
931
- Shackled in perversion. - No, handcuffed in passion.
932
- Yes, but it's his passion! - They have a chemistry...
933
.. it's the meeting of two people lighting fire to the powder.
934
This is the struggle of the sexes, and classes.
935
Vanda is an innocent woman who runs into a pervert.
936
- But then you do not understand anything! - Vanda says: "He has corrupted me!"
937
And what if if her thirst for domination was asleep inside her?
938
Kushemski? If he was to awaken it?
939
And if she was simply a woman?
940
This text brochure looks like it was written by an old Austrian misogynist.
941
He forces her to a game of power and then blames her.
942
- That's not it. - That's exactly it!
943
- How? - Look at the end for example. - Yes?
944
Vanda tells the Greek to whip him...
945
Kushemski .. then leaves him there with his cock in hand...
946
.. and it would be her fault even though he was the one to want it?
947
No, I think that little Kushemski has the hots for the Greek.
948
I wonder how you can be so bitchy at this point.
949
How can you interpret Vanda so well...
950
.. and then be bitchy at this point?
951
Stupid cocksucking actress!
952
What a cunt!
953
Shit!
954
- I'm sorry. - Excuse me?
955
I'm sorry, I screwed up.
956
Yes, but what is said is said.
957
Let's say that the meaning of the play is "beware of your desires."
958
Since you knock on this door...
959
here is the argument of the play... .. you do not take the piss out of a goddess:
960
.. so to speak.
961
So to speak.
962
What is the modern way of saying "so to speak"?
963
"asshole".
964
If you say so.
965
Luckily goddesses do not exist otherwise we would be in deep shit.
966
Okay, you're right.
967
I accept everything you said.
968
Can we... can we continue?
969
Please Vanda.
970
You do not understand that you will never be safe in the hands of a woman?
971
Whoever she is.
972
We are two adventurers, Vanda.
973
Let's explore the limits of human nature.
974
You're sick.
975
You have been poisoned by the countess and now suffer the effects.
976
- But she adores effects like me. - No...
977
You like having complete power over me. - No.
978
Your desires are my orders.
979
I beg and crawl at your feet.
980
Do with me whatever you want.
981
You are a mad visionary, a fanatic.
982
Who is willing to do anything, to realize his dream.
983
- But my dream is you. - Get away from me, Séνerin.
984
Before it is too late.
985
- Do you love me? - I do not know.
986
Decide, do something to be convinced.
987
- How? - Do what all lovers do.
988
- Let me suffer. - This disgusts me.
989
And I hate to pretend.
990
I'm not the countess, your aunt. I am myself.
991
Repeat the line, the challenge.
992
I'm not the countess, your aunt. I am myself.
993
- Again, get angry! - What do you want from me, Thomas?
994
I'm not your fucking aunt, I am me! What do you want?
995
- I don't know!! - This time it is no longer the play.
996
- I want a lot more. - But you're not her.
997
I'm just a poor bitch who needs the work.
998
And I'm not your aunt, I am me. Okay so?
999
Yeah, okay. Very well.
1000
I can't do this part. It's too hard.
1001
Don't go, please. Vanda. Stay here.
1002
Say "I beg you."
1003
I beg you.
1004
- You're bad. - I'm completely in your power.
1005
Liar, you are not in my power, I am in your hands.
1006
You're supposed to be my slave but it is you who dominates me.
1007
- It's true isn't it? - What?
1008
You never stop saying that I have the power but you've got it.
1009
The more he submits the more he dominates.
1010
It's complex, yes.
1011
Here is the contract that we talked about.
1012
It establishes that you agree to a test of total submission.
1013
You will be my slave.
1014
Completely give up your own identity.
1015
Your body, your soul, your honor will all belong to me.
1016
Forever.
1017
Sign at the bottom.
1018
Well?
1019
I thought my commitment would be for a year.
1020
- What? You are trying to dictate conditions to me? - Can I re-read the contract?
1021
Why? Maybe you don't trust me?
1022
Sign.
1023
Good.
1024
From now on you will call me Madame...
1025
.. and you will speak only when allow it.
1026
You will serve me meals and await my orders in the hallway.
1027
In the morning you will dress me and you will dress me in the evening.
1028
Bring me my socks and put on my shoes.
1029
- I'll call you Thomas. - But I'm Gregoir in the text.
1030
I changed it. Henceforth, I will call you Thomas.
1031
You will serve as my valet and bring my coat with my coat of arms.
1032
And as a gentleman... - You have to keep your word.
1033
Don't we have a signed a contract which states that you are my slave?
1034
- But I'm not your slave, I'm your valet. - The difference escapes me.
1035
- Is it a game? - This is what I am.
1036
I'm Stubborn, strong-willed, greedy...
1037
.. and when I start something, I see it through to the end.
1038
The more you resist, the more I persist.
1039
But, deep down, your nature is noble.
1040
What do you know about my nature aside from what you think you know?
1041
Please forgive me, I was despicable.
1042
Give me your passport and your money.
1043
- But .. - give it to me!
1044
Tomorrow we leave for Florence.
1045
I will travel in first class, you in third.
1046
- In third class? - You will eat and sleep with the servants.
1047
- What is it, Thomas? You have something to say? - Where will this end?
1048
End? We havn't even started.
1049
But Vanda, I...
1050
She slaps him...
1051
.. kisses him...
1052
.. and caresses his cheek...
1053
Did I hurt you, my dear?
1054
Yes, you are deliciously evil.
1055
Well.
1056
What did you learn about the handsome Greek?
1057
His name is Alexis, he is a count.
1058
- He's beautiful, isn't he? - Ah, he's fascinating.
1059
Kushemski, you said you had a crush on the Greek.
1060
I have to take a room next to his tonight.
1061
I will allow Count Alexis to seduce me.
1062
Ah, but Vanda...
1063
What is it? Am I not free to do what I please?
1064
- You turns me on. - Silence, dog!
1065
Bring me a rod of birch wood.
1066
He takes the branch to her...
1067
Listen to this hiss?
1068
This sound vibrates my nerves like a tuning fork.
1069
I have only one desire: to hear you groan under the blows.
1070
Feel Herr Doktor Kushemski what I crave...
1071
.. crying like a little girl, my heart leaps in my chest.
1072
The air is hot.
1073
What have you done? What have you done? Bla bla bla bla bla bla!
1074
How bla bla bla? - No. What do you mean?
1075
Vanda turns into evil witch.
1076
Air glowing, my nerves are a tuning fork...
1077
Let's have lightning and drum rolls while we're at.
1078
Tomas, I really, really love it so much.
1079
I like it too, but this has already been seen and reviewed.
1080
What do you mean?
1081
The play is... my play!
1082
It's a superb play and no one will make me change my mind.
1083
Damn!
1084
You don't know anything...
1085
I do not believe, I refuse to demolish my work...
1086
.. Whether you are in the play or not! Go to hell.
1087
Okay, it's you who decides.
1088
She takes a knife and puts it to his throat.
1089
God, how I hate you.
1090
What are you doing? What's going on?
1091
Do you think I don't understand your game?
1092
Do you think you can use me, I could subdue...
1093
I do not want anything of the kind, I swear.
1094
If you only knew how delicious this sensation is.
1095
You know what?
1096
I'll go to the Labour Court...
1097
-since you have has not yet decided if I will get this part.
1098
- I'd like to give you the part. - Now you say this.
1099
Will you put it in writing? CELLPHONE RINGS
1100
Wait, I'm sorry.
1101
- Yes? - Fuck you, Marie-Cécile!
1102
No, I'm still here.
1103
- I have things to finish. - He's fucking me Marie-Cécile!
1104
He's buggering me on all fours on the stage. - Soon.
1105
He fucks like a Labrador in heat!
1106
Yes, soon. You start eating without me, then I'll come. OK?
1107
But it's leftovers? Leg of lamb from yesterday?
1108
I'll call you when I leave and then... Later, yes.
1109
Yeah, okay.
1110
I don't know.
1111
I'll be back when I get back, okay?
1112
Fuck you. Ciao.
1113
- Excuse me. - There was no one on the line, right?
1114
What? - You pretended.
1115
- You pretended to talk to someone. - I was talking with my sweetheart.
1116
- Who is this guy? - Who says it's a guy?
1117
And why did you pretend?
1118
According to you?
1119
I didn't like that I had to answer the phone.
1120
Type  "female revenge"? Or something like that?
1121
Something like this, yes.
1122
Any other director I would have already jumped on him.
1123
- I am not "any other director." - Bullshit.
1124
If you thought you could, you would have already done it.
1125
Not true.
1126
Though I him I allowed?
1127
How did you know all those things about Marie-Cecile?
1128
I met her at the gym. - You saw her!
1129
She seemed very nice and very beautiful. Really.
1130
We were talking while we were changing in the locker room...
1131
.. Series "talks between girls."
1132
I told her I'm an actress...
1133
.. But I also am a private detective, on the side.
1134
And she told me about her boyfriend.
1135
A very mysterious type, a writer.
1136
She gave me a bit 'of money to investigate you...
1137
.. to find out who you are, if you seriously love her, things like that.
1138
I do prenuptial agreements...
1139
I do research on criminal record and financial status.
1140
I have to meet her later at a hotel...
1141
.. and give her a full account.
1142
She has a nice body, huh? Congratulations
1143
You're amazing!
1144
- When a man tells me that I sniff a trap. - Ah, touché.
1145
- Marie-Cécile never showers at the gym. - Ah, no?
1146
Yet she was wet.
1147
Let's finish?
1148
Yes
1149
Put this on.
1150
Thomas, you made me wait. - I'm sorry, ma'am.
1151
I cleaned the silverware.
1152
You really look stylish wearing your uniform.
1153
- Thank you, ma'am. - Turn around.
1154
Oh yes. Definitely irresistible.
1155
I might even forget that you are a valet.
1156
- But something is missing. - Where's this coming from? It's not on...
1157
I'm improvising.
1158
Something's missing.
1159
Yes, really chic!
1160
The icing on the cake.
1161
- You like it? - It is very nice my lady.
1162
I could almost fall in love with you when I see you with this collar.
1163
"Almost fall in love"? This means that you don't love me!
1164
I get bored, I whine constantly.
1165
Your Count? Is he?
1166
You're in love with him?
1167
He followed me to Florence!
1168
He does not love you. He just wants you, as he wanted a thousand others.
1169
Insolent animal! How dare you speak to me in that tone?
1170
- Bring me my boots. - Yes, ma'am.
1171
Not there. In the bag... idiot.
1172
Yes, ma'am.
1173
From now on you will call me Mistress. It is more degrading.
1174
Yes, Mistress.
1175
Do you like my boots?
1176
Yes, Mistress.
1177
Do you like them?
1178
Yes, Mistress.
1179
And my legs.
1180
Yes, Mistress.
1181
Tomorrow maybe I will tie you to the fig tree that stands in the garden...
1182
.. and sting you with my golden clasp.
1183
Or I could attach you naked to a plow...
1184
.. and lash you.
1185
Would you like this?
1186
Yes, Mistress.
1187
I am very pleased with you, Thomas.
1188
I might even give you a piece of candy.
1189
Will there be anything else?
1190
Yes, one last thing.
1191
Call your Marie-Cécile tonight and tell her you are not coming home.
1192
- I can't do that. - Ah, no?
1193
You can't?
1194
No, I can't.
1195
Don't lie to her.
1196
(Marie-Cécile) Hello? - Yes, Marie-Cecile? It's me.
1197
Tonight I cannot come home.
1198
- Tonight I cannot come home. - Do not explain why.
1199
- No, I can not tell you why. - Tell her goodbye.
1200
Goodbye.
1201
Hang up and turn off your cell phone.
1202
Don't you feel great?
1203
Colluding here the two of us together...
1204
This place is so nice.
1205
And also so quiet.
1206
I do not know even where I am. - But think about it.
1207
A new life ahead of you, of us.
1208
There's just us.
1209
We and your friend, the Count.
1210
Stop bothering me by speaking about him.
1211
Haven't I punished you enough? here's the problem.
1212
Just when I wanted to take you in my arms.
1213
you were going to... really?
1214
Come on.
1215
Come here.
1216
Take me in your arms.
1217
You see?
1218
For an hour I'll let you imagine you are free.
1219
In the end you will understand that you are what I want.
1220
An animal.
1221
An object.
1222
An empty space to fill.
1223
No, I will not allow it.
1224
- I will not, I refuse. - I beg your pardon?
1225
- I wrote you a letter. - A letter?
1226
A "Dear John" letter, perhaps.
1227
"The degradation is too much, you have already become unbearable."
1228
The degradation claiming you...
1229
I can not recite this passage.
1230
- I do not see that happening. - How would it be?
1231
Yet it is clear enough.
1232
What should I do? In your head as you see the scene?
1233
But it is the time when... What was the line?
1234
- "I wrote you a letter." - A letter...
1235
A "Dear John" letter, perhaps?
1236
- The degradation claiming you... - Lay down a bit '.
1237
The degradation claiming you, you've already become unbearable?
1238
You have to listen to her for days...
1239
.. you have been afraid to show it.
1240
So? Where is it?
1241
Show me this masterpiece.
1242
A little 'fun would not make me sick.
1243
That's great, Tom. Are you strong.
1244
You should do you Vanda.
1245
No, no...
1246
But yes!
1247
You have to be Vanda.
1248
You understand her character better than me, you created her...
1249
.. you know her intimately.
1250
- I do not know her lines. - But of course you know them.
1251
- Pay attention, Séverin. - I do the best I can, Mistress.
1252
But as usual your best is not up to par.
1253
- Bring me my coat. - Yes, Mistress.
1254
Prepare a bottle of champagne and two cocktails.
1255
The Count Alexis will arrive at any moment.
1256
- But mistress... - If you don't like it, you can leave.
1257
Far from my sight.
1258
Your fur, Mistress.
1259
You will marry the Count Alexis, Mistress?
1260
I will not lie anymore, Séνerin. That man makes me shudder.
1261
Great!
1262
Wait!
1263
Sit down.
1264
It lives in my thoughts, I can not drive it away.
1265
It lives in my thoughts, I can not drive it away.
1266
- I'm suffering. - You're magnificent.
1267
- Still you love this suffering. - Get up and come back a little later.
1268
If you ask me to become your wife, I will say yes.
1269
You are magical.
1270
You know it's very jealous of you?
1271
I told him everything about the two of us.
1272
He probably has threatened to kill you.
1273
In fact...
1274
- The Count hit you? Yes
1275
- You liked it? Yes, it was sublime.
1276
More intense.
1277
- Yes, and it was sublime. - Even more intense.
1278
- He slapped you in the face? - Yes
1279
And it was sublime.
1280
- Oh! - I'll kill you, both of you.
1281
I tear out your heart, throw it to the dogs!
1282
You are cursed!
1283
- What curse? Yes, kill me Séverin!
1284
I'm sick of this comedy.
1285
What comedy?
1286
But how can you love me? I was terrible with you.
1287
I have done everything to save you...
1288
.. to heal, to show you how much I love you.
1289
All to no avail?
1290
None.
1291
It was just a game? A play? And the contract?
1292
Oh, the contract...
1293
My little, sweet, silly...
1294
S�verin, I loved you from the first moment.
1295
I could not tell you why. I am not who you think.
1296
I am weak, and lost... don't you understand?
1297
Not bad.
1298
It is I who should be submissive.
1299
I who should be whipped and tied up.
1300
I think I will tie you to the statue with a pair of your socks.
1301
That's What you want, right? - Yes, I beg you.
1302
Do with me what you wish.
1303
- Promise to never leave me. - I'll never leave you, I swear.
1304
Turn around.
1305
The hands?
1306
I've dreamed of this moment ever since I met you.
1307
Louder, louder.
1308
I humble myself.
1309
Mortify, subdue me, I implore you.
1310
Very well, Tom.
1311
This should be really good.
1312
This is great. But you know what is the problem?
1313
Whatever we say or do, this piece is degrading.
1314
It is an insult to women. Your pornography.
1315
- But what are you saying? - A damsel in distress...
1316
.. a poor defenseless bitch who humbles herself before a man:
1317
"Beat me, hurt me, I'm just a woman."
1318
Holy cow!
1319
- Damn! - Are these emotions too strong?
1320
