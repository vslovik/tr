MUSIC IN THE FOURTH

THUNDER
3
No nobody. Does not exist!
4
A sexy cheerleader who knows how to express himself ...
5
.. with a classic training νaga and a bit of brains in the head.
6
Not even one who knows how to pronounce "inextricable" ...
7
..nothing to do a course of diction.
8
Well, you know ... IMONI
9
(Marie-Cécile) Why do you say so? Talk to some agent.
10
They have playful and bravery actresses. - Yes. I can handle it.
11
At the age of Vanda, at that time, a woman had married ...
12
He had had five children and had taken tuberculosis.
13
But nowadays they all talk like girls of ten years ...
14
.. who breathed the helium: "Too, too mythical!"
15
"It's a splash!"
16
I have nothing but a parade of thirty-five stronts ...
17
Half as a whore and the other half by lesbian.
18
I'd be a Vanda better than most of those girls.
19
With a suit and a pair of socks the game is done.
20
Ready? Ready, honey?
21
Oh, shit ... Ready?
22
- Fuck! (Vanda) Toc toc.
23
I'm late, are not they? Oh fuck!
24
Porca puttana! - If it is for "Furry Venus" ...
25
.. they've all gone for half an hour.
26
I'm sorry, but I was on the other side of Paris.
27
My cell phone was unloaded, I broke a heel ...
28
... on one of those ventilation grids that you do not know what to do.
29
And then there was a guy on the metro that was rubbing me on ...
30
.. for everything the journey.
31
And finally, the thunderstorm. I'm wet to the marrow!
32
Dude, that's just my day.
33
Pussy fucking pussy!
34
Maybe there's a Valium in the medicine cabinet, do you want to watch?
35
No, it's just my usual luck.
36
Thank you, Lord, for making me the easy thing.
37
By the way, I'm present.
38
- Vanda Jourdain. - As? Vanda?
39
Do you understand?
40
I even got the right name.
41
Do you know many girls who are called "Vanda"?
42
I'm done for that part ...
43
.. and you put the metro station in the tunnel with the sleeve.
44
- Her name is? - Thomas Noavachek.
45
Pleasure ... Hey, for a moment!
46
- You are the author. - Yeah, well ... no.
47
I just did the adaptation.
48
"Yes, but she is also the director, are not they?" - Yes, I would say yes.
49
I love her pièces at least what I know.
50
"Anatomy of the shadow", immense! I have two left!
51
It's not mine.
52
Oh! But stupid.
53
- Do you mean that other one. - The other one? - What's wrong.
54
However this is too strong, at least for what I read.
55
It's ok, okay? Sexy in my opinion.
56
Or erotic, kind if you like humiliation and stuff like that.
57
They usually do not wander around in leather and with collar ...
58
They are a reserved type.
59
But I thought I should help get into the party.
60
- Is that shit sad? - Not exactly.
61
- It's set in 1870. - Ah, I understand.
62
- Do not do that much in 1870, are not they? - No not much.
63
- Maybe sadomasochists are already doing so. - Yes, I must know.
64
- I took a photo and the curriculum. - Very well, thank you.
65
Are they? Here ...
66
- Here is the photo ... and the curriculum. - Thank you.
67
It's true, it's a bit short, but I'm done for this part.
68
I stared at Hedda Gabbler and said I was delirious.
69
- The Oratory Theater? - Yup.
70
I did not have the pleasure of following their last season.
71
Do you have an appointment for this audition?
72
At 14. 15 ... a while ago.
73
- Vanda how ... he said? - Jourdain?
74
Everyone always wonders if it's an art name.
75
I do not know his name here.
76
Daννero? My agent swore that it was all right.
77
- I'm not in the list? - Please leave.
78
Fuck! Thank you again, Lord.
79
- But I'm here. - Wait, what does he do?
80
I also have the stage dress!
81
- No! - Wait!
82
- I have a bad suit. - It's useless.
83
Do not you want me to audition? - I do not want to do it, no!
84
- Since I'm here, we might blow it. - They're all gone.
85
- There is nobody to give her a joke. - She can do it.
86
For me it would be an honor for the author to give me the joke.
87
- The adapter. - It would be a force!
88
- Directly from the adapter. - All right, all right!
89
- To say no, Miss ... - Vanda.
90
- Let's get somebody out of here. - Oh yes?
91
- And who are you looking for? - Someone a little more ...
92
..how to say...
93
All right, do not try. Someone who is not me.
94
Too low, too high, too wicked, too playful ...
95
My curriculum is too short, well I understand.
96
- But no, wait. - I got the balls full.
97
- Quiet. - It's not right.
98
Yes, I have enough.
99
My day was a nightmare.
100
We will organize other auditions.
101
Now I'm here, and I wanna go back tomorrow.
102
My day was also very stressful.
103
I had auditions at an army of failures.
104
One even a tooth device.
105
- It would not be the case now. - Okay. - I need to rest.
106
- Then they wait for me for dinner. - Yes, I see.
107
It will be better to do it when I become less tired.
108
Thanks for being kidded and compliments for the dress.
109
- Let's see you very soon. - Maybe it was but it's nice to say it.
110
A person's air is pleasing.
111
This is shit shit ...
112
Do not count the thirty euros for this fucking shit.
113
- Can not find "1800 and something"? - Sure!
114
- Do a lot of Vanda, do not you? - Yup.
115
In my opinion, I wear a stale dress ...
116
... because at that time they all hated their ass.
117
- This is an inaccessibility. - Let her know how it is.
118
SINGLE CELL PHONE Please, be kind!
119
- Yup? - Thank you.
120
The line has fallen, but it was the thunderstorm.
121
No, no!
122
I do not talk to you, someone has just come in.
123
No I do not think so.
124
Then I take sushi along the road.
125
Hello.
126
Can you help me close it?
127
Thomas Noavachek in person will give me the jokes.
128
It will not be of great help to them, I'm not an actor.
129
Let's go, she's perfect. It's spit Kowalski.
130
- Well, Kushemski. - Kushemski.
131
- She is Kushemski. - I would not say that.
132
At your service, mess.
133
Where do we start from? Choose her, I do not have any preferences.
134
Let's take the first scene.
135
Okay.
136
- Does it have its share? - Yup.
137
- It's a bit run-down. - That's the full text.
138
- Who gave it to her? - I do not know.
139
- He sent me my agent. - And how did he get it?
140
Is this a problem? Is it top secret? Should not I see it?
141
It does not matter.
142
- Did you read it? - Yes, escape, on the metro.
143
I have no trace of anything.
144
Do you have Lou Reed's "Venus in furs" song?
145
No, it's from an Austrian novel:
146
"The Furry Venus" written by Léopold Von Sacher-Masoch.
147
I bet he can read the Austrian and read it in the original version.
148
Effectively yes.
149
The book made a scandal when it was published in 1870.
150
I believe it! It is only a sad saddle porn.
151
- It's not a porn sad. - Do not you find porn?
152
Not a little bit?
153
Since it was written in the Middle East in the 1800s and something?
154
"Furry Venus" is a beautiful love story ...
155
.. is one of the great texts in world literature.
156
Oh yes? For me, it's a porn.
157
And sadomasochism I know what it is, do them in the theater.
158
The term "masochism" comes from Sacher-Masoch and this book.
159
Ah! Masochism-Masoch. I should have arrived!
160
So this guy gave his name to sadomaso.
161
It was not his intention. - I would like to see!
162
Believe me a wrote a nice novel and everyone said it was porn.
163
- You broke the book? - No, I did it.
164
I have reinvented the dialogues, situations and ...
165
- There's so much to me here. - Great!
166
Do you wanna, kind, like place?
167
Type in a hotel that you find in a remote spot to the east ...
168
In the Austro-Hungarian Empire. - Make me remember.
169
- It's complicated. - Is that kind of a nice hotel?
170
Yes, it is a spa for wealthy people ...
171
.. a luxurious place.
172
The curtain is raised and Kushemski is in his room.
173
He's reading his book while he's having coffee.
174
And then ... toc toc! Enter Vanda.
175
And is it symbolic of the character of the character you read?
176
No, but there are still people reading the books.
177
- Even for books of paper. - Wrong.
178
This guy's what's called? Sévran, Séveran, Savrìne ..
179
- Séviser Von Kushemski. - Yes, yes.
180
What kind of person is it?
181
Tell me about the agents.
182
Rich, lazy, typical of his era, clever, traveler, educated.
183
- Intellectual.
184
- Just saying. - Ah, "so to speak." Adoro.
185
- I do not know it for so long. - What's strange?
186
- So she is a distinguished one, like her. - Do you want to talk about the character?
187
Yes, I know it by heart ... but yes, please, if you want!
188
I would say that under more than a dozen points is a joyous woman of her time ...
189
.. in spite of the principles that professes but ...
190
- In spite of what? Principles that profess.
191
A first person is a person in the post, posed and very educated.
192
Do not tell me! Anything else?
193
Something I do not know already like ...
194
Let's lose, I'll arrange it.
195
- Does it bother you if I change lighting? - Like lighting!
196
It's a bit over, do not you think?
197
Please, do it as if it were at your home.
198
Is not this better?
199
Not bad.
200
Aspects.
201
I would not know what button to crush.
202
So it is much better.
203
This is what I imagine.
204
Yes, it's the diva.
205
The scribe?
206
The book that has been reported to him?
207
There is the postcard, great!
208
What is this?
209
- A fake symbol? - They're the remains of the previous show.
210
A Belgian production of ...
211
"Red Shadows" adapted to musical comedy.
212
Do you want me to put me on?
213
Do you prefer ...
214
..just in the middle.
215
Courtyard or garden side? - Garden.
216
Do you want us to re-read the text before we begin?
217
No, let's start. Up to do?
218
- End of page three. - Okay. And then he threw me out, did not they?
219
- In the meantime, we think we're screaming. - And then he threw me out.
220
- Look, I ... Ah, yes! Dimenticaνo ...
221
- The phrase that on page 0, like the quotation. The epigraph?
222
Yes, that.
223
"The Almighty Lord struck him and put him in the hands of a woman."
224
It is a quotation that appears in the novel, is taken from the Book of Judith.
225
Is it in the Bible? - In the Apocryphal Books of the Bible, yes.
226
I do not know anything at all.
227
- Oh yes. Do not you think it's sexist?
228
"The Almighty Lord struck him and put him in the hands of a woman."
229
I just mention it to Sacher-Masoch's novel.
230
Yes, but I did not put it on zero page ...
231
She does nothing, I do not care, I'm just an actress.
232
I forget the fur!
233
- She's holding a stool, is not she? - Yes, in fact.
234
Fur, fur ...
235
Soft fur ...
236
Maybe it is not ...
237
This...
238
But...
239
The duchess stockings are dry and dry-arch.
240
The duchess stockings are dry and dry-arch.
241
Station jars. Station jars.
242
- Whenever you want. - Has your tea taken away the coughing tenacious?
243
If it will not be seren will reassert.
244
MAKE YOUR VERSES
245
Knock Knock. - Avanti.
246
Herr Doctor Séνerin νon Kushemski?
247
Excuse me if I'm bothering you.
248
My name is Vanda νon Dunayeν.
249
Accommodation in the room above her.
250
Last night I found this book, a copy of "Faust" ...
251
..with his bookmark inside.
252
I was sitting under the birches near the statue of Venus.
253
Thank you very much.
254
I just asked the waitress to retire.
255
I should have done it, but there is a bold postcard inside.
256
It's a Titian, are not you?
257
Yup.
258
"Venus in the Mirror", one of my favorite paintings.
259
His Venus looks like he is well served ...
260
.. just like his book.
261
Are you faithful?
262
- How do you say, excuse me? - To the original.
263
Yes, it's a copy ... faithful to the original.
264
I understand his infatuation, it is a fascinating picture.
265
Thank you for having bothered to bring me back.
266
I could not avoid noticing the strange poetry written in the back.
267
"Furry Venus". Is it his work?
268
- They're bad guys. - Poor? Really?
269
"To love and be loved, or what a charm ..."
270
"..but, stronger, more beautiful yet .."
271
"This is the torment that consumes me."
272
"I'll kiss this woman I'm a witch ..."
273
"... the miserable slaughter ..."
274
"..there, the footstool."
275
"My goddess, my dictatorship ..."
276
"My Venus in Fur."
277
They are interesting.
278
If I were in her, I would pay close attention to this bookmark.
279
I appreciate your discretion.
280
Do you want to sit down for a moment?
281
Thank you.
282
- Can I take the fur? - Very kind to you.
283
It's a Tartar fur, do not you?
284
A Caucasian zibellino? I would say Kazakhstan.
285
A Kazakh cabbage jelly, exactly.
286
Kushemski, standing, looks at the fur in his hands.
287
But she's trembling!
288
Yes, please forgive me.
289
- Can I offer you something to drink? - Willingly.
290
- A coffee would be perfect. - Then take my own.
291
How nice it is!
292
- Two litters, please. - He needs coffee ...
293
I hope I do not mind hearing you walking up here with the heels.
294
For anything in the world!
295
Walk as much as you want with your heels.
296
So you are a poet, Herr Kuskhemski?
297
Lost time.
298
And is a passionate fox expert?
299
The love for the fur is ...
300
- Jumping this joke, the next is ... - No, read.
301
Love for fur is innate.
302
It is a passion given to everyone by nature.
303
It puts us a little more of a commitment.
304
Love for fur is innate.
305
It is a passion given to everyone by nature.
306
Caring a soft and thick fur ...
307
... feel that particular tickle, that electricity ...
308
I think that for her is not just a gift of nature.
309
Did her mother embezzle her in a zibellino when she was small?
310
I'm indiscreet.
311
Please forgive me. - No me...
312
It was one of my aunts to have a passion for the fur.
313
- That's why that explains everything. - We can all easily explain.
314
- But we remain inextricable. - ίnestricabili?
315
- What do you mean? - Wisdom makes us what we are.
316
End of page three.
317
THUNDER
318
Effectively yes ...
319
- Very well, Vanda. - I was looking for clutches.
320
- I did what I could. He seemed very confident.
321
That's what it means to know how to create an atmosphere.
322
- I'm a professional. - Yeah, yeah ...
323
- Stop it, I'll drop it red. - I did not say it was perfect.
324
- No, of course. - Are we going to go for a while?
325
After Kushemski made his speech ...
326
.. you go to ...
327
- Read this to help me enter the character. - żo recito.
328
- She's doing fine, Thomas. - No, it's an impression.
329
She speaks very well.
330
Has anyone ever thought about someone for Kushemski? - Not exactly.
331
- I have options. - She should do it.
332
- Yes sure! - I think so seriously.
333
- She would be very good at it. - However, it is difficult.
334
- Let's get all this out to the actors ... - He's the director, he's his dad.
335
- For director is the first one. - It would not be.
336
I decided to do it because the directors never understand anything.
337
- You do not know what I endured ... - That's why it's perfect.
338
- You know what you need to do. - I've got everything in my head.
339
I want to use the "Lyrical Suite" by Alban Berg for transitions ...
340
- Great as an idea! - Do you know the "Lyrical Suite"?
341
No, but do you understand that I want to say?
342
- You know the story of interiority, characters, everything! - Yup.
343
For Kushemski, she should look something like an accent ...
344
... or stuff like that. - He's a distinguished man.
345
- Yes. - And with one I do not know ...
346
Aristocratic.
347
Is it quite distinct if I move that way?
348
Or is it just stupid?
349
It's a bit chunky but it's great.
350
- Would not it be a room for you? - Yup.
351
- I was joking! - Want to pass it on?
352
Courage, it will help.
353
But it's magnificent.
354
- Is it wrong or is it vintage? - So they told me.
355
Siegfried Mueller ...
356
..Vienna ...
357
.. 1869.
358
I did not do it.
360
It looks tailor made for her.
361
- How do you feel about it? - Very well.
362
And I'm brushing it.
363
- It's her figure. - Yup.
364
Hello nice guy.
365
And that dog collar how much did he pay for it?
366
It is a reminder of the period when the pavement is bathed.
367
Joke!
368
Let's get back from a few more farther backs.
369
Did her mother embezzle her in a zibellino when she was small?
370
I'm indiscreet, please excuse me.
371
It was one of my aunts to have a passion for the fur.
372
- It's all right for him to say this. - Yes, no wonder.
373
- Then take courage. - Yup.
374
I'm indiscreet, please excuse me.
375
It was one of my aunts to have a passion for the fur.
376
- That's why that explains everything. - We can all easily explain.
377
But we remain inextricable.
378
lnestricabili!
379
What do you mean?
380
Wisdom makes us what we are in an unpredictable moment.
381
Coffee is your liking?
382
I just tasted it but it looks great.
383
And this is symbolic, do not you? Ίl coffee is he ...
384
.. and she just tasted it but she's already excited.
385
In fact, he unmasks me.
386
Have you ever experienced such a "unforeseen moment"?
387
Actually yes, but I do not want to bother you.
388
All the while, so fascinates me.
389
Like one of those English policing novels.
390
I look like mysterious aunt who loved the fur.
391
- This part we can skip it. - No, read it. I want to hear it.
392
I look like mysterious aunt who loved the fur.
393
I was an infernal baby ...
394
Cruel and cruel.
395
Martyrize our maids and our cat.
396
I also behave badly with one of my aunts.
397
The Countess was a majestic, vulgar and terrible woman ..
398
- What's up? - Anything.
399
It's just that by telling her to hear high the words I wrote ...
400
... two in the morning on a screen seem to be dimmed.
401
If she's yanking her big!
402
What did your aunt do?
403
One evening she was hesitant.
404
It came to my room ...
405
With his big black coat of Russia.
406
In the hand there is a need, a branch of birch ...
407
With her there was the cook and the maid.
408
The fur has been removed and the sleeves are rolled ...
409
I have tried to escape ...
410
The other women have taken hold of me ...
411
They lowered my pants and threw me on the fur.
412
They keep me silent as my aunt casts me with her.
413
My buttocks and bare thighs were on fire.
414
The maids encourage her.
415
They played for me, they treat me as feminine.
416
I do not mind it but my aunt continued to hit me ...
417
.. until the moment I did not beg to stop ...
418
.. for piety.
419
When she finally stopped, she forced me to thank her ...
420
And kissing her feet.
421
Then later he left the room threatening to return.
422
And all this in the presence of the maids ...
423
And our cat.
424
Starting from that moment ...
425
... fur was no longer a simple fur ...
426
A branch of birch a simple branch.
427
In a moment she made me ... what I am.
428
- And is he coming back? - Yup.
429
In my dreams, with her black fur and her śerga.
430
And she wants to make me sleepy again, night after night.
431
- My friend. Poor?
432
She taught me the most precious thing in the world.
433
- And what did she teach her? - That nothing is more sensual than pain.
434
That nothing is more exciting than degradation.
435
The Countess has done well to her.
436
My ideal is quenched.
437
From that day I look for her double.
438
And when I meet that woman I will marry her.
439
This passage is sensational!
440
Thank you, they asked me a lot of them.
441
In practical terms, is it a kind of child maltreatment?
442
It does not matter.
443
What the fuck does the child abuse with this story?
444
Punch this, this mania of our day ...
445
To bring everything back to a social problem of the dick.
446
- Maltreatment is not just ... - Do not follow the stereotypes!
447
We are not talking about anthropology or sociology!
448
- Let's do theater. - Yes, but anyway ...
449
Here's much more about the issue of corporal punishment.
450
All right, excuse me!
451
In what impetuous and dull world we live!
452
Why do we always try to bring everything back to something else?
453
What else will he pull out right now? Sexism, racism, class struggle?
454
Well, you are certainly unique, Herr Kushemski.
455
If I were in her, I would be careful.
456
His ideal woman might reel more cruel than he does not want.
457
I'm ready to run the risk.
458
I know what she is ... A suzrasensuale.
459
An ascetic of the ull.
460
And you, Frau Vanda νon Dunaye, who or what?
461
I am a pagan.
462
It means they are playful, beautiful, rich ...
463
.. and that you can take advantage of them as much as possible.
464
I will not deny anything.
465
I have the utmost respect for its principles.
466
Please excuse me, but I am afraid of his respect.
467
I will love the man who will please me ...
468
.. and I'm happy with the man who will make me happy ...
469
I just do it until it makes me happy and then I'll find another one.
470
For a man there is no greater cruelty than the unfaithfulness of a woman.
471
For a woman there is worse: forced loyalty.
472
- Can I move? - Yes, yes ... he moved.
473
In our company ...
474
... the woman can only have power through the intercession of a man.
475
What will be the woman when she will equal the man?
476
When will she hurt her?
477
Little Vanda is a sack for his time!
478
How do you know all the jokes?
479
- I do not know, I learn in a hurry. - He knows all the text by heart!
480
Did not she say Vanda is in a good position in spite of what?
481
- Principles that profess. - Here are those. - Yup.
482
According to you Vanda does not believe all these stories.
483
That's what he says ... the rights of women, blah blah blah ...
484
But for her, kind of, a character, mind.
485
Because he said "the principles he professes" and not "his principles."
486
I think I really liked the alliteration: "of the principles that profess."
487
I see!
488
He sold the soul for an all-match.
489
It is, I declare myself guilty.
490
Said among us, Thomas, you're a little dick.
491
If it allows, I would say that ...
492
She is better than a pagan. It seems to me a goddess.
493
- Really? And which? - Venus.
494
And is Vanda Venere, or am I kidding?
495
Is Venus who has taken human semblance to come to torment him?
496
Not exactly.
497
- Or rather not exactly. - Okay, there are! It's dull.
498
- She wants you to be ambivalent. - Ambiguo. - Yes, that one.
499
In reality, it is the story of "The Baccanti".
500
What was "The Baccanti"?
501
- It's a knife, do not you? - It's a very old pièce.
502
Citizens of Corinth. It is before you a Testiculus ...
503
... but mortal cursed by gods for his offenses ...
504
..and completely fucked up to the end of time.
505
- Is this a pie of this kind? - Yup.
506
Diòniso goes down to Earth and makes the arrogant king of Tebe ...
507
.. a tremula gelatin laden by a woman. - It would be exciting.
508
After that, the unleashed women of Tebe the Baccanti broke it.
509
And Diòniso came back to his house, triumphant. - I think I've seen her.
510
In our case, however, this is not about Diòniso but Aphrodite.
511
Who is it?
512
- It's the Greek version of Venus. - But it is the same person.
513
The same goddess. - Ave or Aphrodite!
514
Aye, oh Aphrodite. Are they so unbearably pedantic?
515
Yes, but I find it a nice thing.
516
Yup.
517
What are we doing?
518
It seems to me a goddess.
519
Really? And which?
520
Venus.
521
But Venus can only rule in a world of slaves.
522
Then it will be better for me to find one.
523
Would you like to be my slave, Herr Doktor Kushemski?
524
I am already.
525
I was depressed by his slaughter from the time he entered this room.
526
Have you already fallen in love with me?
527
Deeply.
528
I'm suffering as if I've known her forever.
529
- I'm sorry. - Get up straight away and get away from me.
530
I have to confess that it intrigues me.
531
I love her frankness and the clarity of her thoughts.
532
From a point of physical illness, she has charm, no doubt.
533
But if a man submits me, I sniff a trap ...
534
There are no traps. You love Me!
535
- You see? He has already begun to give orders. - Marry me.
536
I'm a naughty woman, Herr Kushemski.
537
To love me, she will have to give great courage.
538
- I've already explained my principles. - I do not care.
539
- I want my wife down. - She does not know anything about me.
540
- You dominate me. - Is absurd.
541
You give me complete power over me, for eternity.
542
Do me what you want.
543
- Dominate me, peep me if you want me. - This comes to me unexpected.
544
- Let's get that side. - Thing?
545
- He puts himself in the middle, bottom. - No, I'm fine here.
546
He would have to move there.
547
It takes power and puts itself in a position of power.
548
Recapture.
549
- This comes to me unexpected. - Yes. - Not good!
550
It does not die, I do.
551
You give me complete power over me for eternity, unconditionally.
552
Do me what you want. Dominate me.
553
I peek if you want.
554
- This comes to me unexpected. - She does not even pretend to smoke?
555
Want me to put me here, I put myself here.
556
And then it's just a hearing.
557
It is also a hearing to see if you accept to be direct.
558
Do what I say and stay there.
559
You give me complete power over me for eternity, unconditionally.
560
Do me what you want, dominate me.
561
- Peak if you want. - This comes to me unexpected.
562
- You're right, it's better. - Keep going.
563
What do you want in the depths of your heart?
564
To belong to her ...
565
..compare in its sublime essence ...
566
..discover and sneeze it ...
567
..drug her stockings, put on her shoes ...
568
..nothing more than my own.
569
And this she calls him love? - It's the only love we have.
570
In love, as in politics, only one of the parties must have power.
571
One must be the hammer and the other the anvil.
572
I agree that I am an anvil.
573
That's enough.
574
Keep it, I like it!
575
Thomas, but what intelligence, especially for women.
576
- You understand them by women. - Yes, yes ... years of studies.
577
- Where was I left? - She was an anvil.
578
Vanda, I'm looking for the pain and her pleasure.
579
Never let yourself be dominated by the feelings of others.
580
She uses her lover as he would serve her.
581
The domain, saves it like a lemon.
582
She is amazing.
583
If you do not want me as a husband, take me as a slave.
584
I deal with cruelty.
585
Why should I mistreat anyone who loves me?
586
- But I would love her even more. - I do not want to be worshiped.
587
All women want to be worshiped, like our Creator.
588
Create me! I ruin! It reduces me to nothing!
589
SELLING THE CELL
590
For a moment, excuse me.
591
Ready? Yup.
592
No, I have not left yet.
593
Everything is alright.
594
It's all right ...
595
I do not know.
596
The moment, huh?
597
Do I call you when I leave?
598
Yes, I too, my love.
599
- Yes, then ... Yes, all right.
600
Excuse me, huh?
601
For the hearing I do not know.
602
Now I'm at the temporary agency, maybe they have something.
603
As a typist, a nightmare in an important law firm.
604
The contract is for tomorrow.
605
I do not know!
606
Whatever will be, will be.
607
That's right, I'm sorry.
608
- Crazy! - His half?
609
Is that still said? - She says half today?
610
- Do not I know ... asshole? - Ah okay.
611
- Wondering why I lied? - No, I do not care.
612
How is that Vanda saying?
613
"I will not deny anything, I have other cats to fuck."
614
- Stupid way of saying. - She's the hammer, he's the anvil.
615
What I have to say? "Yes, dear, all you need"?
616
This has nothing to do with love, but with my ass.
617
And if he does, he must take the rest.
618
- That's what he's talking about. - Oh yes?
619
Do you play me?
620
- I do not know, do you believe it? - Stop doing it.
621
Can not one of you say what you think?
622
Talking with her is more complicated than dancing the tango.
623
Do not you want her to have a coffee?
624
Why, what is it?
625
- Are you dying? - Absolutely not!
626
I'm just offering her a coffee.
627
- Is it a symbolic coffee? - No, it's a coffee.
628
What would his wife say if she wanted to offer me a "no coffee"?
629
- I'm not married. - Ma νa?
630
I guess so soon on the phone.
631
- He was my girlfriend. - It's the same.
632
What would you think? In an interview he said:
633
"The theater is the best way to get girls in bed".
634
Do not tell me she read that stuff.
635
I was young, it was my first interview.
636
- Have you ever been married? - Never.
637
- And she still lives with her mother? - I'm strange but not so much.
638
Is your fur going to pass his passion?
639
- No, it's love. - She's strangely funny.
640
And my wife must be my muse.
641
So your girlfriend has a pair of wings and everything else?
642
In love you have to launch completely.
643
And she dives. - I swear to fish ...
644
With fireworks, dizziness and thunder.
645
Coffee yes or no coffee?
646
I conceive of giving myself to a man for the sake of losing his slave.
647
I would say that we are not compatible at all, Herr Kushemski.
648
We will annul ourselves.
649
And I'd say we're done for each other.
650
Is not that what you hear, Vanda? Is not that what you hear too?
651
I offer you a try, a contract like a business.
652
It will take a year to prove to me that it is the man I need.
653
- One year is long. - I have not finished yet.
654
- Please forgive me. - You will be my slave for a year.
655
So do not do anything!
656
Awaits everything before entering.
657
- She believes? - Stop doing the naive.
658
- She is the author. - I'm not sure he has prepared everything.
659
And I'm honest, I swear.
660
So is he kidding? It is ambivalent.
661
- Ambiguo. - Yes, yes.
662
Or he's a lazy bitch, ready for anything to enjoy.
663
A lazy bitch? Have not you ever thought about her like that.
664
It can be even more complicated.
665
"Be my slave for a year and then I'll fuck you."
666
- It's always ambivalent, do not you? - Ambiguo.
667
- Ambiguo. - From my point of departure, indeed from that of Kushemski ...
668
..would be his last chance. Maybe even the only one.
669
And to do that?
670
- Of νiνere. - Yup.
671
He loves whiplashes and wants to know if he likes it too.
672
- She makes a hearing. - She also makes a hearing with him.
673
He is a weird and she is an object like all the women of 1800.
674
What's up?
675
So who are you, Frau Vanda Jourdain?
676
- I'm a pagan. - No, I'm serious.
677
It starts to move on.
678
Where does it come from? What's his story about?
679
Military Daughter, grown up around, I have no tenderness.
680
Have you been? In which city? Ίn which countries?
681
I will make a contract whereby you agree that you will be my slave for a year.
682
- I'll be in your orders. - It's a deal.
683
They swap a handshake.
684
- There is a Greek officer in the hotel. A Greek? - Yup.
685
It comes from Athens.
686
She has a white stallion like her and she has black leather stitches.
687
I want you to get my room number.
688
- But, Vanda ... What is it?
689
Are you already reluctant? - Please forgive me.
690
Tomorrow you will be waiting for me in the birch forest, and at the statue of Aphrodite.
691
- At what time? You will wait until the moment I decide to quit.
692
- Very well. - Do not show up without the Greek Chamber Number.
693
And now, kiss my foot.
694
And he kneels and kisses his foot.
695
I love this part, it is very straightforward.
696
Pass me the fur now.
697
Séäin, how's it going to end?
698
This only depends on you, Frau Vanda νon Dunayeν, and not from me.
699
Thank you for coffee, slave.
700
Yes, I would be right now. A coffee I mean.
701
It was intense. The handshake was electric.
702
The happiness of an era when people were more introverted.
703
A simple confusion had already left eroticism.
704
The conversation. The only thing to put under your teeth.
705
The book does not start that way, do not you?
706
- The book? - Yup.
707
The beginning scene is over ...
708
When does Venus look naked in his fur at the fireplace?
709
- Did you read "Furry Venus"? - I gave him a look.
710
When he said he did not know what it was about, he lied.
711
I took a little advantage.
712
- Why did not she take that scene? - I did not know how to use it.
713
Just put it at the beginning, kind before meeting with Vanda.
714
You can not think of making "Venus in Fur" without Venus.
715
And she can use the same actress for Vanda and Venus.
716
- Naked in the scene? No problem. - Yes, I'll think about it.
717
- Why do not we impoverish? She'll give you ideas. - And how?
718
You have to change the lights.
719
- Are we at the top of the pièce? - In the room of Kushemski ...
720
..in the middle of the night.
721
Okay, heart of night, two in the morning.
722
We laugh a bit ...
723
Fire in the fireplace, garden side.
724
Yes, very good.
725
What is Kushemski doing?
726
- I do not know. - What a fantasy!
727
Too much discount?
728
He is also reading when he meets Vanda.
729
He can not even read at the beginning, we are not in the library.
730
Maybe he could write his diary.
731
I like this.
732
Yup.
733
Then I'm Venus.
734
Who cares!
735
Do as if I were naked. Are you trying with me?
736
Imagine being a girlfriend and sudden.
737
- Ah, it's the first I have to do. - All the girls say.
738
Yeah, but for me it's the little thing.
739
The fire in the fireplace burns, we see Venus naked ...
740
... lazily in a fur ...
741
Strength, I'm in the fur.
742
She is the director.
743
I said "leave it".
744
Now let's go to scrijevania.
745
Give him the character.
746
Scriava on her diary.
747
- She screams. - I'm doing.
748
But at high waits, we're at the theater! If not how do we know who it is?
749
We are at the beginning of the pièce.
750
The scene lights up little by little ...
751
.. we hear the tic tac of a spade pendulum.
752
Tic tac ...
753
..tic tac ...
754
..tic tac ...
755
..tic tac!
757
Two in the morning.
758
Stay in a spa ...
759
Surrounded by forests and mountains.
760
It is a moonless night, darkness and silence reign.
761
VANDA FITTING A moment! I hear a sparrow.
762
- A nightingale. - A nightingale.
763
VANDA MLAGOLA
764
And the calling of a cat in heat.
765
I feel tremendously only ...
766
... happy, dissatisfied.
767
(In German) Good evening.
768
Well, did the Germans want us another?
769
I hope not to bother.
770
Absolutely not.
771
Aye, Aphrodite.
772
- So you did not forget me! - Forget about you?
773
My dearest and worst enemy?
774
- You're too kind. - Yup.
775
Do I have a right to a small kiss?
776
- That's better, but Thomas ... - Oh! - Did I say Thomas? Ooops!
777
It's so cool in here!
778
Everyone who wants to find you, I get cold.
779
STARNUTLSCE See?
780
I already have inflammatory bronchi.
781
If you do not spend the time walking all naked ...
782
But I'm Venus, I have to be naked.
783
It's part of the laVoro.
784
Do not you want to take away those ruinous rumors and come close to me?
785
There is so much place here under my fur.
786
No thanks.
787
I brought this for you, directly from the Olympus.
788
It's Daddy!
789
- Do not you see the label? Made in Olimpo. Because?
790
Why would I be interested in yours?
791
I know your little foul.
792
Women are not interested in you.
793
You are interested in their fur, you should marry an ottoman.
794
I'd better understand it with an otters than with a woman.
795
But if I put my legs under my waist ...
796
Would you like a little love?
797
Is it a bit of love you suggest to me?
798
No, it's the power you care about.
799
- Do you resist me? - Yes, yes.
800
Séférin, I want you on the floor, at my feet.
801
- You'll suppl. - Yeah.
802
You already belong to me and you will belong to me until the end of time.
803
- Yeah. - (in German) Arriead.
804
I'll be back.
805
And then, puff, disappears.
806
Wow! - Mica male, eh?
807
- Yeah, no ... - She could scribble her and put her in the pièce.
808
Here, so to speak, yes.
809
- In this view ... - It's a little bit of a stress on Dietrich.
810
Yes, it works very well.
811
And then he gives a picture of Kushemski.
812
Yes, in the middle of the night is there that makes it difficult with Venus ...
813
And then the next morning with Vanda: "Do me yours, I beg you."
814
We could end by lowering the lights ...
815
.. and then when we get up there is morning, toc toc ...
816
Here comes Venus re-emerged from Vanda.
817
- For revenge. - But yes, it's great!
818
So is she you? - Thing?
819
Him and her?
820
Kushemski - Noavacek, Noavacek - Kushemski.
821
- No, it's not me. She said there's a lot of her there in there.
822
Then maybe she is Vanda.
823
- The pièce has nothing to do with me. - Of course, she's just the author.
824
Ops, the adapter.
825
Type: "If a critic says this is me, I kill him."
826
- Will I have the right to persuade the characters? - Sure.
827
Looks like you've come across the characters of a sadomaso novel.
828
No, it's a famous book and I ...
829
Have not experienced his "unforeseen time" at the age of twelve?
830
- No. - In library ...
831
- No! - With a cat.
832
No.
833
Is he still waiting for his "big time"?
834
I'm not expecting anything!
835
I find that the relationship between the two characters is fascinating, complex.
836
- Of course! - I love the emotional depth of the characters.
837
There is no such thing nowadays.
838
You no longer hate this kind of anger today.
839
- Let me introduce some of my friends. - Okay.
840
Very well, then I do not understand a good accident.
841
When he comes home, does his girlfriend not tie her to bed to frustrate her?
842
No.
843
She should ask him so much to see if the girlfriend is available.
844
- Stop calling her "the girlfriend." - Excuse me.
845
What do you think of the pièce its half?
846
- You do not like him very much. - You will have to be afraid that you say it is ìi.
847
It's not about us.
848
Let me tell you about her ...
849
Marie-Cécile.
850
I bet it's more fun than her.
851
Good extraction.
852
Surely she grew up in a beautiful family home in the province.
853
- From the parts of La Baule? - Nantes, actually.
854
But I bet her family spent the weekends at La Baule ...
855
In a beautiful garden yard.
856
Practice it laughs and loves the seafood.
857
Yes, it is not.
858
It is high, slightly authoritarian, but without being sided.
859
Deep-haired hair ...
860
..longs legs and a nice pair ...
861
Eyes.
862
A mind of all respect.
863
He did the preparatory school in Paris, or Louis Le Grand.
864
Do I have a lot of mistakes?
865
Henry IV, School of Economics. - And she has a doctorate.
866
- He's finishing his thesis in sociology. - He has a dog?
867
Let's see a little ... I would say a labrador.
868
Is called...
869
It has an unusual name that makes a little intellectual.
870
- Bourdieu? - He'll go.
871
Culture is not lacking, I see.
872
I bet it's rich in breakthrough ...
873
Even if a tearful theater and a Belgian cactus ...
874
... does not exactly Comédie Française.
875
No, there is family grain. Am I right?
876
Of course I say good.
877
But she is the artist and this in Marie-Cécile is losing her head ...
878
.. along with her sensitivity.
879
She is the first man she met ...
880
.. who has a feeling of being.
881
He loves books, opera, ballet, things like that.
882
In the evening, look at Arté and talk about the last Goncourt ...
883
.. and then do a quiet fuck.
884
Nothing is better than a quiet spit to relax.
885
But there's a rumor that rumors her head ...
886
He asks you to claim other things.
887
I do not know what it is, but it bumps.
888
Bum.
889
Bum.
890
Bum.
891
Meanwhile, Thomas is happy.
892
The girls are very well ...
893
.. and you'll spend a quiet night watching Arté ...
894
.. and to talk about the last Goncourt.
895
You will have children who will just like you and then you will die.
896
Do we keep reading?
897
Yes, we continue.
898
The next day's meeting in the birch forest? - All right.
899
We pretend it's the statue of Venus.
900
Aye, Aphrodite.
901
A, Aphrodite ...
902
Do we hesitate to read the text?
903
Well, Séerd.
904
No, no, that's fine.
905
All these stories of slavery and domination ...
906
She has corrupted me with all these speeches.
907
I'm convinced that she would love to dominate a man.
908
- No. - Maybe even torture him.
909
- No. - He admits it.
910
It's not from me.
911
- How can I reason? - The devil is the reason!
912
Séäin, you do not understand?
913
She will never be safe in the hands of a woman ...
914
..what she is.
915
But this joke is sexist. I want to scream!
916
What is sexist?
917
"She will never be safe in the hands of a woman."
918
- But it's in the book ... - It does not change anything.
919
- The book is sexist. - The book is not sexist.
920
- On the contrary, it's something ... - A classic of world literature.
921
- Are you saying this? - Not exactly.
922
And this?
923
We do not have a Titian here, my dear.
924
- It's a pretty sadmouth porn. - But what ...?
925
- This story is nothing but a big cliché. - And why?
926
Is one spanked and suddenly loves to whip it?
927
- That's what happened to the author. - And it happened to her too? - No!
928
So what do you know?
929
For me it is a piece of two people that are united for eternity.
930
Their hearts are handcuffed to each other.
931
- Handled in perversion. - No, handcuffed in passion.
932
- Yes, but his passion! - It's chemical ...
933
.. is the meeting of two people who give fire to the polveri.
934
This is a fight of the sexes, of classes.
935
Vanda is an innocent woman who faces a pervert.
936
- But then he does not understand anything! - Vanda says: "She has corrupted me!"
937
And if the thirst for domination had sunk in her?
938
Had Kushemski been awakened?
939
What if she was just a woman?
940
This text looks like an Austrian misogyny brochure.
941
He obliges him to play a power and puts him in charge.
942
- That's not so. - That's right.
943
- And how? - You think in the end. - Yup.
944
Vanda tells the Greek to whip it ...
945
.. then leave Kushemski there with his cock in his hand ...
946
.. and would it be his fault even if he was to defeat him?
947
No, I think the little Kushemski has the potions for the Greek.
948
I wonder how it can be bitten up to this point.
949
How can Vanda interpret it so well ...
950
..but be banged up to this point?
951
Fucking actress fucking!
952
That bastards!
953
Fuck!
954
- I'm sorry. - Excuse me?
955
I'm sorry, I was dragged.
956
Yes, but what is said is said.
957
We say that the meaning of pièce is "beware of your desires"
958
Since she could knock on her door ...
959
.. do not take a goddam her ass: here is the argument of the pièce ...
960
..just saying.
961
Just saying.
962
What is the modern way of saying "so to speak"?
963
"Guy".
964
If she says it.
965
Much worse than the goddesses do not exist otherwise she would be in the shit.
966
All right, he's right.
967
All he says is okay.
968
Can we ... can we continue?
969
For fate, Vanda.
970
Do not you understand that you will never be safe in a woman's hands?
971
Whoever she is.
972
We are two avenues, Vanda.
973
We explore the limits of human nature.
974
She is sick.
975
It was denied by the countess, now its effects are affected.
976
- But she loves the effects like me. - Well ...
977
- He likes to have complete power over me. - No.
978
His desires will be orders.
979
I would supplant it, I would strike at her feet.
980
Do me what you want.
981
You are a crazy, a fanatic.
982
He is willing to do anything to accomplish his dream.
983
- But my dream is you. - Get away from me, Sérecier.
984
Before it's too late.
985
- She loves Me? - I do not know.
986
Decide, do something to convince her.
987
- And how? - Do what everyone loves.
988
- Let me suffer. - This disgusts me.
989
And I did not pretend to pretend.
990
I'm not the countess, her aunt. I am myself.
991
Repeat the challenge, challenges.
992
I'm not the countess, her aunt. I am myself.
993
- Still, get angry! - What do you want from me, Thomas?
994
I'm not her aunt fucking, I'm me! What do you want?
995
- I do not know. - At this time it is no longer a matter of pièce.
996
- I want a lot more. - But I'm not her.
997
I'm just a little bitch who needs to laurel.
998
And I'm not her aunt, I'm me. That's right?
999
Yes, that's fine. Very well.
1000
I can not do this part. It's too hard.
1001
Do not be afraid, for a lieutenant.
1002
Say "I beg you".
1003
I beg you.
1004
- She's awful. - I'm completely in his power.
1005
Lieutenant, you're not in my power, I'm in his hands.
1006
He says he is my slave but she is the one who dominates me.
1007
- Is not that right? - Thing?
1008
He does not stop saying that she has the power but he has it.
1009
The more he submits the more domination.
1010
It's complex, yes.
1011
Here is the contract we talked about.
1012
She determines that she agrees to make the most total submissive.
1013
It will be my slave.
1014
He will completely renounce his identity.
1015
His body, his soul, his honor will belong to me.
1016
Forever.
1017
Sign in at the bottom.
1018
Well?
1019
I believe my commitment would last a year.
1020
- Do you want to dictate my conditions? - Can I re-read the contract?
1021
Why, do not you trust me maybe?
1022
Sign.
1023
Good.
1024
From now on you will call me lady ...
1025
.. and you will only speak when I will authorize you.
1026
You will serve me meals and wait for my orders in the corridor.
1027
In the morning you will be victorious and you will fall in the evening.
1028
I'll poke your stockings and put on your shoes.
1029
- I'll call you Thomas. - It's Gregoir in the text.
1030
I changed it. From now on, I'll call you Thomas.
1031
You will wear the diya's home with my coat of arms.
1032
- How much gentleman ... - Keep the word out.
1033
Did not you sign a contract to make sure you're my slave?
1034
- Your slave but not your servant. - The difference escapes me.
1035
- Is this a game? - That's what I am.
1036
I'm stubborn, νolitiνa, cpup ...
1037
.. and when I start something, I get to the bottom.
1038
The more I resist, the more I stubborn.
1039
But in the deep, his nature is noble.
1040
What do you know of my nature aside what you think you know?
1041
Please apologize, I was spared.
1042
Give me your passport and your money.
1043
- But ... - Give it to me!
1044
Tomorrow we leave for Florence.
1045
I'll fly it first class, you're in the third place.
1046
- Third class? - You will eat and sleep with the servants.
1047
- What is it, Thomas? - Will this end us in the end?
1048
At the end? We did not even begin.
1049
But Vanda, I ...
1050
She slapped him ...
1051
..o bacia ...
1052
He caresses his cheek ...
1053
Did I hurt you, my dear?
1054
Yes, deliciously bad.
1055
Good.
1056
What did you know about the beautiful Greek?
1057
It's called Alexis, it's a count.
1058
- It's nice, do not you find it? - Oh, it's fascinating.
1059
I say that Kushemski had a cook for him.
1060
I have to take a stage next to her at work tonight.
1061
I will allow Count Alexis to seduce me.
1062
Ah, but Vanda ...
1063
What's up? Am I not free to do what I'm up to?
1064
- She excites me. - Silence, dog!
1065
Bring me a birch bark.
1066
He brings them one ...
1067
Do you hear this hiss?
1068
This sound makes my nerves like a diapason.
1069
I just have a desire: to hear you groan under the blows.
1070
Listen to Herr Doktor Kushemski who begs me ...
1071
.. she cries like a little girl, my heart falls in my chest.
1072
The air is glowing.
1073
What have you done? What have you done? Bla bla bla bla bla bla!
1074
Come bla bla bla? Ίn what sense?
1075
Vanda turns into witch cattiвa.
1076
The incandescent air, my nerves are a diapason ...
1077
Let's put some picks and drum rollers out there.
1078
Tom, she likes me so much.
1079
I like it so much, but this is already alive and rejuvenated.
1080
How do you mean?
1081
The pièce is ... my pièce!
1082
It's an extraordinary work and nobody will make me change my mind.
1083
Pity of misery!
1084
She does not know anything ...
1085
I do not believe it, I refuse to demolish my laojo ...
1086
..what you say in the pièce or not! Go get her ass.
1087
Okay, she decides.
1088
She takes a knife and puts it in her throat.
1089
God I hate you.
1090
What does he do? What happens?
1091
Do you think he does not understand your game?
1092
You think I can use, to subdue me ...
1093
I do not want anything like that, I swear it.
1094
If you knew how delicious this feeling is.
1095
Do you know what I say?
1096
I will go to Laavora Tribunal ...
1097
... because he has not yet decided if I have any part.
1098
- I'd love to give you the party. - That's what he says right now.
1099
Can you put it in writing? SELLING THE CELL
1100
Wait, excuse me.
1101
- Yup? - Shut up, Marie-Cécile!
1102
No, I'm still here.
1103
- I have some things to finish. - She's fucking me!
1104
I bend to four feet on the stage. - Soon.
1105
It fucks me like a labrador in heat!
1106
You start eating without me, then I get it.
1107
Okay. But is not she a little lame lamb shaven yesterday?
1108
I'll call you when I get out and then ... Then, yes.
1109
Yes, that's fine.
1110
I do not know.
1111
I'll be back when I'm back, okay?
1112
Fuck you. Hello.
1113
- Sorry. - There was no one on the other side, did not they?
1114
As? - Face to face.
1115
- Talk to someone. - I spoke with my half.
1116
- And who is this guy? - Who says she's a guy?
1117
And why did he pretend?
1118
In your opinion?
1119
I think I did not like that I answered the phone.
1120
Type "Female Nurse"? Or something like that?
1121
Something like this, yes.
1122
Any other director would have jumped on me.
1123
- I'm not "any other director". - Bullshit.
1124
If he thought he could do it, he would already have done it.
1125
It is not.
1126
Even if I allowed it?
1127
How do you know all those things of Marie-Cécile?
1128
I met him in the gym. - But look at it a bit!
1129
Avaea the air very nice and then it is really beautiful.
1130
We were talking as we moved in the locker room ...
1131
... series of "talking between girls".
1132
I told her I'm an actress ...
1133
I'm also doing the detectives I'm trying to recycle.
1134
And she tells me about her boyfriend.
1135
A very mysterious type, a writer.
1136
He gives me some money to inquire about him ...
1137
... to find out who he is, if he loves him seriously, things like that.
1138
Prematurely information ...
1139
... with criminal record and financial situation.
1140
I have to meet her later in a hotel ...
1141
... for a complete account.
1142
He has a beautiful body, huh? Congratulations.
1143
She is amazing!
1144
- When a man tells me so much a trap. - Touché.
1145
- Marie-Cécile does not shower in the gym. - Oh, no?
1146
Yet it was wet.
1147
We finish?
1148
Yup.
1149
Put this one.
1150
Thomas, you made me wait. - I'm desolate, ma'am.
1151
They are silverware.
1152
You are so elegant with that louis vuitton.
1153
- Thank you Madam. - Turn it around.
1154
Definitely irresistible.
1155
I could even forget you're a servant.
1156
- But something is missing. - Does this want to come out? Not on the ...
1157
lmproννiso.
1158
Something is missing.
1159
Yes, yes chic!
1160
Cherry on the cake.
1161
- You liked it? "It is very nice, ma'am.
1162
I could almost fall in love with you when I was with you.
1163
"Almost fall in love"? This means you do not love me!
1164
I'm bored, whining constantly.
1165
Is the Count? And he?
1166
Are you in love with him?
1167
He followed me to Florence!
1168
He does not love her. He wants you, how he wanted a thousand others.
1169
Insolent breed. How dare you speak with that tone?
1170
- Take my steals. - Yes Madam.
1171
Not there, in the bag ... idiot.
1172
Yes Madam.
1173
From now on you will call me mistress. It's more degrading.
1174
Yes, master.
1175
Do you like my steeds?
1176
Yes, master.
1177
Would you like to put them?
1178
Yes, master.
1179
To my legs.
1180
Yes, master.
1181
Tomorrow I'll tie you up, maybe with the fig tree you find in the garden ...
1182
.. and I'll push you with my golden clip.
1183
Or I could bury you naked at a plow ...
1184
.. and let you go hastily.
1185
Would this please you?
1186
Yes, master.
1187
I'm very happy with you, Thomas.
1188
I could also give you a candy.
1189
Can I still be useful to you?
1190
Yes, one last thing.
1191
Call your Marie-Cécile and tell her tonight you will not be home.
1192
- I can not do this. - Oh, no?
1193
You can not?
1194
No, I can not.
1195
Do not tell bales.
1196
(Marie-Cécile) Ready? - Yes, Marie-Cécile? It's me.
1197
Tonight I can not go home.
1198
- Tonight I can not go home. - Do not explain why.
1199
- No, I can not tell you why. - Come on.
1200
Arriνederci.
1201
Reattach and turn off your mobile phone.
1202
Does not it look smugish to you?
1203
Meet here two together ...
1204
This place is so enjoyable.
1205
And even so quiet.
1206
- I do not know anymore either. - But think about it.
1207
You open a nuevo in front of you, to us.
1208
We're just us.
1209
We and his friend, Count.
1210
Stop bothering me about him.
1211
I do not punish you enough, here's the problem.
1212
Just when they have to take you in your arms.
1213
Are you standing for ... anyway?
1214
Come.
1215
Come here.
1216
Get in your arms.
1217
See?
1218
For an hour I'll let you imagine being free.
1219
In the end you will understand that you are what I want.
1220
An animal.
1221
An object.
1222
A space to fill.
1223
No, I will not allow it.
1224
- I do not want to, I refuse. - I apologize?
1225
- I wrote her a letter. - A letter?
1226
A goodbye letter, maybe.
1227
Is the degradation that you've been forced to make is already unbearable?
1228
The degradation that we ...
1229
I can not recite this passage.
1230
- I do not understand what's happening. - How would that be?
1231
Yet it's fairly clear.
1232
What do I have to do? In your head how do you spell the scene?
1233
But is the time when ... What was the joke?
1234
- "I wrote a letter to you." - A letter...
1235
A goodbye letter, maybe?
1236
- The degradation you deserve ... - Give it a little.
1237
Is the degradation that I have been forced to make you unbearable?
1238
Have to hear her on a few days ...
1239
I will be afraid to show you.
1240
Then? Doν'è?
1241
Show me this captain.
1242
A bit of veneration would not hurt me.
1243
That's fine, Tom. You are strong.
1244
You should do Vanda.
1245
No, no ...
1246
But yes!
1247
Have to be Vanda.
1248
You understand his character better than me, you created it ...
1249
You know her intimately.
1250
- But I do not know his jokes. - Yes you know.
1251
- Be careful, Séverin. - I do my best, master.
1252
But as usual, your best is not up to you.
1253
- Take my fur. - Yes, my lord.
1254
She prepares a bottle of champagne and two cocktails.
1255
Count Alexander Alexis will come from moment to moment.
1256
- But master ... - If you do not mind, you can leave.
1257
Far from my drive.
1258
His fur, mistress.
1259
Will Count Alexis marry you, mistress?
1260
I will not lie anymore, Sérecier. That man makes me tremble.
1261
Great!
1262
Wait!
1263
Sit down.
1264
I live in my thoughts, I can not throw it away.
1265
I live in my thoughts, I can not throw it away.
1266
- It makes me suffer. - You are great.
1267
- Yet I love this suffering. - Get up and stay a bit more.
1268
If he asks me to sue his wife, I'll say yes.
1269
You're magic.
1270
Do you know he is very jealous of you?
1271
I told him everything about us two.
1272
And he probably threatened to kill her.
1273
In the effects ...
1274
- Count you hit her? Yup.
1275
- Did you let her go? Yes and it was sublime.
1276
More intense.
1277
- Yes and it was sublime. - Even more intense.
1278
- Blow it in your face. - Yup.
1279
And it was sublime.
1280
- Oh! - I'll kill you, both of you.
1281
I will tear your heart, throw it to the dogs!
1282
Let her be damned!
1283
- Damn it! Yeah, I'm killing Sérecier!
1284
I can not do this comedy anymore.
1285
Which comedy?
1286
But how does he love me? I was terrible with her.
1287
I did everything to get her out ...
1288
To heal it, to show you how much I love it.
1289
Was there nothing wrong with it?
1290
Anything.
1291
Was it just a game? A recital? And the contract?
1292
Oh, the contract ...
1293
My little, tender, silly ...
1294
Séäin, I loved her from the first moment.
1295
I can not tell you why I'm not who she believes.
1296
I'm weak, I'm lost ... do not you understand?
1297
Not bad.
1298
It's me that I should be submissive.
1299
It's me that I should be frustrated and tied up.
1300
I think I'll tie you to the statue with a pair of your socks.
1301
It's what you want, do not you? - Yes, I beg you.
1302
Do me what you want.
1303
- She promises never to leave me. - I will never leave you, I swear to you.
1304
Ln feet.
1305
The hands?
1306
I dream this time since I met her.
1307
Stronger, even stronger.
1308
We humbled ourselves.
1309
You mortify me, sit down, I beg you.
1310
Very well, Tom.
1311
It's okay.
1312
Is fantastic. But do you know what the problem is?
1313
Whatever we say, or do, this piece is degrading.
1314
It's an insult to women. It's pornography.
1315
- What are you saying? - A bridesmaid in trouble ...
1316
... a little bastard with no defenses humiliating himself by a man:
1317
"Punch me, make me sick, I'm just a woman."
1318
Porca νacca!
1319
- Curse! - Of strong emotions?
1320
All right.
1321
"You no longer hate this kind of anger today."
1322
But Vanda ...
1323
Thank me.
1324
Thank you.
1325
Thanks to whom?
1326
Thank you, mistress.
1327
Think they can fool a stupid thing, huh?
1328
