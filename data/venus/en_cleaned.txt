1
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,835
MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND

2
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,172
THUNDER

3
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,288
No, no. This does not exist!

4
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:06,291
A young sexy guy who knows how to express himself...

5
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:10,170
..classical training with a vague talent and just a bit 'of the brain in the head.'

6
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,548
Not one who knows how to pronounce "inextricable"...

7
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,299
.. without having done a course in diction.

8
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,303
Well ', listen... THUNDER

9
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:21,932
 (Marie-C�cile) Why do you say that?
Turn to some agent.

10
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:25,018
 These actresses, young and brave.
- Yes  I can handle it.

11
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:29,064
At that time a woman was married at Vanda's age...

12
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,442
.. had five children and had come down with tuberculosis.

13
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,279
Instead today all girls talk like they're ten years old...

14
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,949
.. and have breathed helium:
"Too, too cool!"

15
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,826
"It's one thing that rocks!"

16
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,829
I have a parade of more than thirty bitches...

17
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,582
..Half dressed as bitches and the other half as lesbians.

18
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,793
Vanda or I would be better
than most of those girls.

19
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,962
Just put on a dress and a pair of socks
you're done.

20
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,964
Hello? Hello, darling?

21
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,551
Oh, damn... Hello?

22
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,430
- Fuck!
 (Vanda) Knock, knock.

23
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:07,603
I arrived late, right?
Oh shit!

24
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,856
 Holy shit! - If you are coming
for "Venus in Fur"...

25
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,608
.. everyone left half an hour ago.

26
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,235
I'm sorry, but I was
on the other side of Paris.

27
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,487
My phone was charging,
I broke a heel...

28
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,991
.. on one of those ventilation grilles
that no one knows where they are.

29
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,202
And then there was a guy on the subway
who rubbed himself on me...

30
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,120
.. Everything's this way.

31
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,873
And finally, the storm came.
I'm soaked to the bone!

32
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,250
Holy cow, it's
my day.

33
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,377
Holy shit bitch!

34
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:36,131
Maybe there's a Valium in the medicine cabinet, want to look?

35
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,966
No, it's just my luck.

36
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,260
Thank you, Lord,
for making my life easier.

37
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,387
By the way, let me introduce myself.

38
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,389
- Vanda Jourdain.
- Who? Vanda?

39
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,475
Do you understand?

40
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,143
I even have the right name.

41
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,145
Do you know a lot of girls who call themselves "Vanda"?

42
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,396
I was made for that part...

43
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,775
.. and she takes the subway stop in the tunnel with the turn.

44
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,610
- And your name is?
- Thomas Novachek.

45
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,862
Pleasure... Hey, wait a minute!

46
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,531
- You are the author.
- Yes, well... no.

47
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,617
I did the script.

48
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,371
- Yes, but you are also the director, right?
- Yes, I would say yes.

49
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,123
I love your work
at least the ones I know.

50
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:13,669
"Anatomy of a shadow," great!
I saw it twice!

51
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,504
Not me.

52
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:17,923
Oh! But that was stupid.

53
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:21,176
- I meant that other one.
- What other? - What a shame.

54
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:25,430
However, this one is too radical,
at least from what I've read.

55
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,933
Er 'rather risqu�, right?
Sexy in my opinion.

56
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,686
Or erotic, kind if you like
humiliation and stuff like that.

57
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:34,314
I do not usually go around
dressed in leather wearing a dog collar...

58
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,566
.. I'm a reserved type.

59
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:40,279
But I thought that I would help me get into the
part.

60
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:43,073
- It's S & M stuff?
- Not exactly.

61
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:46,451
- It's set in 1870.
- Ah, I see.

62
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:50,163
- Not much of this in 1870, right?
- No, not really.

63
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:54,334
- Perhaps the sadomasochistic ones dressed
like this. - Yeah, I'll go find out.

64
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,921
- I brought a photo and a resume.
- Very well, thank you.

65
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,343
Where are they? Here...

66
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:07,180
- Here's the picture... and the script.
- Thank you.

67
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:12,311
True, it's a bit short
but I was made for this part.

68
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:15,689
I starred in Hedda Gabbler
and they said I was fabulous.

69
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,983
- The Theatre of the urinal?
- Yes

70
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:21,320
I have not had the pleasure of following
their last season.

71
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,238
You had an appointment for this audition?

72
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,241
At 2 pm or 3... a little 'time ago.

73
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,994
- Vanda... what did you say?
- Jourdain?

74
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:32,372
Everyone always asks me if it's a stage name.

75
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,586
I don't see your name here.

76
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:40,964
Really? 
My agent swore that it was all right.

77
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,509
- I'm not on the list?
- Please, leave.

78
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,512
Fuck! Well, thanks, sir.

79
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:51,641
- But since I'm here...
- Wait, what does?

80
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,728
I also know the scene!

81
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,106
- No!
- Wait!

82
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:01,026
- I even have a costume.
- It's useless.

83
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:06,365
- You don't want me to audition?
- I do not want to do it. No!

84
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:09,785
- Since I'm here we might try.
- They're all gone.

85
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:13,163
- There is no one to run your lines.
- You can do it.

86
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,041
For me it would be an honor to have the author do the scene with me.

87
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,418
- The author.
- Fantastic!

88
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:22,297
- Directly from the author.
- Okay, stop!

89
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,425
- To tell the truth, Miss...
- Vanda.

90
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,428
- Try something different.
- Oh yeah?

91
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,515
- Who do you want?
- Someone a bit more...

92
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,183
.. how to say...

93
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:36,686
Okay, don't try so hard.
Someone who is not me.

94
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,899
Too short, too tall,
too old, too young...

95
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:44,694
My resume is too short,
okay I understand.

96
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,957
- But no, wait.
- I've pissed you off.

97
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,043
- Calm down.
- It's not fair.

98
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,921
Really, I've had enough.

99
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:08,343
My day was a nightmare.

100
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,054
You can arrange other auditions.

101
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:14,683
I'm here now, I'd avoid
having to come back tomorrow.

102
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:17,978
Even my day was very stressful too.

103
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:20,355
I auditioned an army of failures.

104
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,232
One even had braces on her teeth.

105
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:25,485
- Now would not be the time.
- Okay. - I need to rest.

106
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,238
- Then I'll have some for dinner.
- Yes, I understand.

107
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,699
It will be better to do it when I'm less tired.

108
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:34,494
Thank you for coming and congratulations on the dress.

109
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,707
- I'll see you soon.
- I wish it were so, but it's nice to say it.

110
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:41,501
You look like a decent person.

111
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,503
This is a shitty job...

112
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,882
.. not to mention the thirty euros
for this shitty costume.

113
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:53,513
- Do not you find this face
"1800 something"? 
- Of course!

114
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,140
- It is very Vanda, right?
- Very lovely.

115
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,641
I think wearing a dress this long...

116
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,143
.. because at that time everyone hated asses.

117
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:01,021
- This is a misstatement.
- I see how it is.

118
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:04,733
CELLPHONE RINGS Please, be nice!

119
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,860
- Yes?
- Thank you.

120
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,404
Oh, I must have lost track of the time.

121
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,031
No, no!

122
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:14,159
I am not speaking to you,
someone has just came in.

123
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,786
No, No. I don't know.

124
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:22,000
Then I'll take the sushi
just get takeout.

125
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,793
Hello.

126
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,422
Can you help me close it?

127
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:38,683
Thomas Novachek in person will give me the lines.

128
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:42,687
It won't be much help,
I'm not an actor.

129
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,941
Come on, you're perfect.
You'll crush Kowalski.

130
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,817
- No, Kushemski.
- Kushemski.

131
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,445
- You are Kushemski.
- OK, all done.

132
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,701
At your service, sir.

133
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,454
Where do we start?
You choose. I don't care..

134
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,706
Let's try the first scene.

135
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,416
Okay.

136
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,710
- It has its fair share?
- Yes

137
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:30,944
- It's a bit the worse for wear.
- Is that the full text?

138
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,862
- Who gave it to you?
- I don't know.

139
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:36,074
- I got it from my agent.
- And where did he get it?

140
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:40,328
Is this a problem? Is it top secret?
Should not I see it?

141
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,747
It's not important.

142
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:47,627
- Have you read it?
- Yes, in passing, on the subway.

143
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,005
I have seen that is adapted from something.

144
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,215
From a song by Lou Reed
"Venus in furs?"

145
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,010
No, it is taken from a novel by an Austrian author

146
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:59,014
"The Venus in Fur" by Leopold von Sacher Masoch.

147
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:02,767
I bet you know how to read Austrian
and have read it in the original version.

148
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,228
Actually yes.

149
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,857
The book caused a scandal when it was published in 1870.

150
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,610
I believe it!
It's a porn BDSM.

151
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:14,613
- This is not a porn BDSM.
- You don't think it's porn?

152
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,364
Not even a little?

153
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,117
Since it was written in the Middle Ages,
in 1800 or something?

154
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,995
"Venus in Fur"
is a beautiful love story...

155
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:25,248
It's a masterpiece.
It's one of the great texts of world literature.

156
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,542
Ah, yes? For me, it's a porno.

157
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:31,046
Sadomasochism, I know what it is, I work in the theater.

158
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,633
The term "masochism" comes from Sacher-Masoch and
from this book.

159
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:38,887
Ah! Masochism-Masoch.
I get it!

160
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:42,307
So this guy has given his name to sadomasochism.

161
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,684
- It was not his intention.
- I see.

162
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,687
He believed he had written a good novel
and they all said it was porn.

163
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,649
- You have plagiarized the book?
- No, I adapted it.

164
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:54,444
I reinvented the dialogue, the situations and...

165
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,696
- There is so much of me in here.
- Great!

166
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,449
Genius! Where does it take place?

167
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:03,453
In a hotel that is located on a remote
mountain in the eastern part of...

168
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:07,415
.. the Imperial Austro-Hungarian Empire.
- Let me remember.

169
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:11,086
- It's complicated.
- It's a nice place?

170
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,089
Yes, it is a spa for wealthy people...

171
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,965
.. a luxurious place.

172
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,218
The curtain rises and Kushemski is in his room.

173
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,221
He is reading his book while drinking coffee.

174
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,431
And then... knock knock! Cue Vanda.

175
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:27,811
It is symbolic from the point of view 
of the character?

176
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:31,064
No, but there are still people who read the book.

177
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,442
- Sometimes even the real book, on paper. 
- Ah, you caught me.

178
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:37,862
This fellow, what's his name?
Sevran, Severan, Savr�ne ..

179
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,824
- Severin Von Kushemski.
- That's it..

180
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,243
What kind of person is he?

181
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:46,955
Tell me some adjectives.

182
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:51,626
Rich, idle, typical of his era,
smart traveler, cultured.

183
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:54,379
- An intellectual.


184
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,382
- So to speak. - Ah, "so to speak." I love it.

185
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,260
- I haven't heard anyone talk like that in a long time.
- I wouldn't know.

186
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:03,722
- So she is a distinct type?
- You want me to talk about the character?

187
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,974
Yes, I know it by heart... but
yes, please, if you like!

188
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:14,107
I would say that from many points of view
she is a young woman of her time...

189
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,109
.. in spite of the principles she professes, but...

190
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,486
- In spite of what?
Of the principles she professes.

191
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:22,282
At first glance she is a person
in place, poised and very cultured.

192
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,659
As you say! Anything else?

193
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,620
Something that I do not already know?

194
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,039
Never mind, I'll manage.

195
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:36,045
- Will it bother you if I change lighting?
- The lighting!

196
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,631
It's a bit' too much, don't you think?

197
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,387
Please,
make yourself at home.

198
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,694
Is that better?

199
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,446
Not bad.

200
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,407
Wait.

201
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,952
I don't know how to work that.

202
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:12,207
OK. That's much better.

203
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,723
I guess this is the sofa.

204
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,351
Yes, it's the sofa.

205
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,854
A desk?

206
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,608
The book that is discussed?

207
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,693
There is a postcard, fantastic!

208
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,246
What is this?

209
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:56,000
- A phallic symbol?
- There are remnants of the previous show.

210
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,213
A Belgian production of...

211
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,883
.. "Stagecoach"
adapted to musical comedy.

212
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,264
Where would you like me to stand?

213
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,100
Where do you prefer...

214
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,399
.. less at the center.

215
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:22,235
Side yard?
- Garden.

216
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,531
You want to re-read the text before you start?

217
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,908
No, let's begin. Up to where?

218
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,788
- End of page three.
- Okay. And then throw me out, right?

219
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,125
- You want me to to try?
- And then throw me out.

220
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:40,003
- Look, I...
 Ah, yes! I forgot...

221
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:45,258
- The phrase that on the first page,
The citation.  The epigraph?

222
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,260
Yes, that one.

223
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:50,680
"The Lord Almighty
struck him and put him in the hands of a woman."

224
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:54,767
Is a quote that appears in the novel,
It's taken from the Book of Judith.

225
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,812
 It's in the Bible?
- In the Apocryphal books of the Bible, yes.

226
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,814
I do not know anything about that.

227
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,443
- Ah, yes.
Don't you think it's sexist?

228
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,946
"The Lord Almighty
struck him and put him in the hands of a woman."

229
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,782
I just mentioned the novel of Sacher-Masoch
.

230
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,827
 Yes, but since you put it on page
zero...

231
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:17,332
It does not matter, does not concern me,
I'm just an actress. But you...

232
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,168
 Forgot the fur!

233
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,171
- She's wearing a stole, right?
- Yes, indeed.

234
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,681
Fur, fur...

235
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,059
soft fur...

236
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,978
Maybe not...

237
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,607
This...

238
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,446
Good ..

239
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,615
(she begins voice warmups)
The socks are dry and the Duchess is
arch-dry.

240
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,493
The socks are dry and the Duchess is
arch-dry.

241
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:58,456
Ka ke ke ke.
Ka ke ke ke.

242
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:03,002
- When you're ready.
- "The tea has cured your stubborn cough?"

243
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:06,506
"If you will not leave the role."

244
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,591
(Blows rasberries)

245
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:18,142
 Toc toc.
- She enters.

246
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,733
 Herr Doktor von Severin
Kushemski?

247
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,905
I'm sorry if I'm bothering you.

248
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,116
My name is Vanda von Dunayev.

249
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,536
I am in the room above you.

250
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:41,416
Last night I found this book,
a copy of "Faust"...

251
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,918
.. with your bookmark inside.

252
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:48,297
I was sitting under the birches,
near the statue of Venus.

253
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,429
Thank you very much.

254
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:58,182
I had just asked the waitress to look for it..

255
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:03,312
I found it and there is a postcard inside.

256
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,065
This is a Titian, right?

257
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,942
 Yes

258
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,820
"Venus in the mirror,"
one of my favorite paintings.

259
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:13,656
Your Venus looks to be well used...

260
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,575
.. just like your book.

261
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,702
She is faithful?

262
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:21,330
- Excuse me?
- Original?

263
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,960
Yes, it is a copy...
faithful to the original.

264
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:30,465
I understand your infatuation,
it's a ravishing picture.

265
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,676
Thanks for having troubled to bring it back.

266
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:38,097
I could not help noticing the strange
poem written on the back.

267
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,975
"Venus In Fur".
Did you write it?

268
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:45,480
- Those are poor, poor verses.
- Shoddy? really?

269
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:51,444
"To love and be loved, or as a charm..."

270
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,739
".. yet, stronger, more beautiful still .."

271
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,992
".. is this torment that consumes me."

272
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:01,370
"I will kiss this woman
I am a victim..."

273
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,122
".. the slave miserable..."

274
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,750
".. submissive, the footrest."

275
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,586
"My goddess, my dictator..."

276
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,755
".. my Venus in Furs."

277
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:15,885
 The sentiments are interesting.

278
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:19,388
If I were you, I'd take better care of this.

279
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,767
I appreciate your discretion.

280
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:31,025
Want to sit for a moment?

281
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,027
Thank you.

282
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:37,532
- May I take your coat?
- Very kind of you.

283
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,122
This fur is a tartar, right?

284
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:47,792
A sable of the Caucasus?
I would say of Kazakhstan.

285
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:52,505
Yes, a tartar sable from Kazakhistan, exactly.

286
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,675
Kushemski, standing, observes
the fur between his hands.

287
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,638
But you are trembling Kushemski.

288
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,559
Yes, I pray you to forgive me.

289
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:09,188
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Gladly.

290
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:12,817
- A coffee would be perfect.
- Then take mine.

291
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,569
How kind!

292
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:18,072
- Two lumps, please.
- He serves coffee...

293
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:36,090
I hope the noise above doesn't bother you
when I walk in heels.

294
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,967
I'd give anything in the world.

295
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:41,220
To hear you walk so well in your heels.

296
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,806
So you're a poet,
Herr Kuskhemski?

297
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,850
A waste of time.

298
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:48,352
And a passionate expert on fur?

299
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,480
The love of fur...

300
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,859
- Skip this measure, the following is
... - No, read it.

301
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,696
The love of fur is innate.

302
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,615
a passion given to all by nature.

303
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,117
Put in a little more effort.

304
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,372
The love of fur is innate.

305
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:11,626
a passion given to all by nature.

306
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,629
Caress a soft and thick fur...

307
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,882
.. hear that particular crackle, that electricity...

308
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:22,720
I think that it is not only a gift of nature.

309
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:27,892
Your mother
wrapped you up in a sable when you were little?

310
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,769
But that's indiscreet.

311
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,104
 I beg your pardon.
- No, I...

312
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:38,861
It was one of my aunts
who had a real passion for fur.

313
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:43,616
- So that explains it.
- We are all easily explained.

314
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:47,411
- But we remain intractable.
- Inextricable?

315
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:51,499
- What do you mean? 
- Life makes us what we are?

316
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,292
End of page three.

317
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,546
THUNDER

318
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:02,009
Actually yes...

319
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:07,014
- That was going very well, Vanda.
- I was looking for footholds.

320
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,558
- I did what I could.
- Seemed very solid.

321
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:13,062
That's what it means to be
able to create an atmosphere.

322
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:16,315
- I am a professional.
- Really, it was...

323
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,151
- Stop it, I'll blush.
- I did not say it was perfect.

324
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:22,446
- No, of course.
- Let's go on a little more.

325
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:26,534
Kushemski - After that he makes his big speech...

326
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,452
.. you go to...

327
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,956
- Read, it helps me to get into character. Please recite.

328
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,458
- You read well, Thomas.
- No, it's an impression.

329
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,336
You read really well.

330
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,922
- Have you already thought of someone for Kushemski? 
- Not really.

331
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,216
- I have several options.
- You could do it yourself.

332
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,844
- Yes, of course!
- I think so seriously.

333
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:47,471
- You would be very good.
- No, it's quite difficult.

334
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:52,226
- Does the director inflict this on all the actors?
- It is his job.

335
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:55,604
- I'm directing for the first time.
- Doesn't look like it.

336
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:59,317
I decided to do this because
directors never understand anything.

337
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,360
- You have no idea what I have endured...
- That's why it's perfect.

338
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:05,323
- You know what to do.
- I have everything in my head.

339
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:09,368
I want to use the "Lyric Suite"
by Alban Berg for the transitions...

340
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,871
- a great idea!
- He knows the "Lyric Suite"?

341
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,998
No, but you understand what I mean?

342
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:17,209
You know the story of the inner life,
of the characters, everything! - Yes.

343
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:21,964
What accent Kushemski should have...

344
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,508
.. or something of the kind.
- He's a distinguished man.

345
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,594
Yes, distinguished 
- And with that, I don't know...

346
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,471
.. an aristocrat.

347
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,515
he moves like this...

348
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,018
Or is that just stupid?

349
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:37,271
a little.
It's silly but it is fantastic.

350
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:40,983
- For this scene he would wear
a dressing gown? - Yes

351
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,529
- You're joking!
- Want to try it?

352
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,742
Buck up, I'll help.

353
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,163
But it is magnificent.

354
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:57,792
- Am I wrong or is it vintage?
- So I'm told.

355
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,919
Siegfried Mueller...

356
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:02,046
.. Vienna...

357
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,132
.. 1869.

358
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,053
I hadn't seen that.

359
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:11,430
40 euros at the flea market.

360
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:31,200
Seems tailor-made for him.

361
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,953
- How does it look?
- Very good.

362
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,455
It is close to my size.

363
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,333
- You look great.
- Yes

364
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:46,173
Hello, sweet guy.

365
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,551
And the dog collar?

366
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,720
It is a reminder of the period in which I beat the pavement.

367
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,599
Joke!

368
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,852
Let's pick up a few lines back.

369
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:07,945
Your mother
wrapped you up in a sable when you were a little baby?

370
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,739
That was indiscreet,
please forgive me.

371
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:14,869
It was one of my aunts
who had a real passion for fur.

372
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,705
- For him it is tough to say this.
- Yes, it's no wonder.

373
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:20,082
- Then take courage.
- Yes

374
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:24,253
That was indiscreet,
please forgive me.

375
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:32,386
It was one of my aunts
who had a real passion for fur.

376
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:37,391
- So that explains it.
- We are all easily explained.

377
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,019
But we remain inexplainable.

378
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,229
Inexplainable?

379
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,522
What do you mean?

380
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:48,486
Life makes us what we are
in an unpredictable moment.

381
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,281
Is the coffee to your liking?

382
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:55,534
I just tasted it. It's excellent.

383
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,913
This is symbolic, right?
The coffee is...

384
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,999
.. and she has just tasted
but is already excited.

385
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:04,293
Ln fact, I was suprised.

386
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:11,008
Have you ever experienced such a surprising moment
Mister Kushemski?

387
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:14,929
In reality, yes, but I will not bother you.

388
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,431
On the contrary, it fascinates me.

389
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,017
Like one of those English detective novels

390
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,646
He had a mysterious aunt who loved fur.

391
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:28,442
- We could skip this part.
- No, read it. I want to hear it.

392
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:32,279
He had a mysterious aunt who loved fur.

393
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:35,699
I was a child from hell...

394
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:38,536
.. spoiled and cruel.

395
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:41,539
Mean to our maids and our cat.

396
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:45,584
I behaved very badly with one of my aunts.

397
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:51,340
The Countess was a woman
majestic, voluptuous and terrible ..

398
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,718
- What is it?
- Nothing.

399
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,596
just saying aloud the words that I wrote
...

400
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,598
.. two in the morning on a screen
looked different.

401
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:02,101
You're doing great!

402
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,978
What did your aunt do?

403
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,356
One evening he is avenged.

404
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,194
She came into my room...

405
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:17,575
.. with her big black Russian fox coat

406
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:23,122
In her hand she held a rod,
a branch of birch...

407
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:26,875
..
With her were the cook and the maid.

408
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:31,589
She took off her coat and she rolled up his sleeves...

409
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:34,717
.. I tried to escape...

410
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,344
.. but the other two women
took hold of me,..

411
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:42,266
I lowered my pants and she threw me on the fur.

412
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:48,856
I held still while my aunt
punished me with the rod.

413
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:53,902
My buttocks and my
naked thighs were on fire.

414
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:58,157
The maid encouraged her.

415
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:02,411
She made fun of me, treated me like a sissy


416
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:06,040
I danced away but my aunt continued to hit me...

417
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:11,545
.. until such time as
I begged her to stop...

418
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,547
.. out of pity.

419
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:20,054
When she finally stopped,
she forced me to thank her...

420
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,681
.. and kiss her feet.

421
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:28,646
Then she left room
threatening to come back.

422
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:31,774
And all this in the presence of the
maids...

423
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,318
.. and our cat.

424
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:36,403
From that moment...

425
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:40,407
.. fur to me more than simple fur...

426
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:43,327
.. nor a birch branch
a simple branch.

427
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:47,706
In a moment she made me who I am...

428
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,337
- And she came back?
- Yes

429
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:57,216
In my dreams, with her black fur
and her rod.

430
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:00,219
She comes to visit me again,
night after night.

431
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,347
- My poor friend.
 Poor?

432
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,685
She taught me the most valuable thing in the world

433
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:12,314
- And what did she teach you?
- That nothing is more sensual than pain.

434
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,984
That nothing is more exciting
than degradation.

435
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,195
The Countess did her job well.

436
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,198
It has become my ideal.

437
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:24,368
From that day I seek her double.

438
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:27,996
And when I meet this woman I will marry her.

439
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:31,375
This step is sensational!

440
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:34,378
Thanks, it took a lot of work.

441
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:39,341
In practical terms, it's like a play
child abuse?

442
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,388
It has nothing to do with it.

443
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:48,600
What the fuck does the maltreatment of children 
have to do with this story?

444
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:51,895
Holy cow, this craze nowadays...

445
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,772
.. bring everything to a social problem of cock.

446
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:57,860
- The abuse is not only...
- Do not follow stereotypes!

447
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:01,530
Do not talk about anthropology or sociology!

448
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,407
- Let's make theater.
- Yes, but...

449
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:07,536
Here there is much more at stake than
the issue of corporal punishment.

450
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,788
Okay, I'm sorry!

451
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,624
Most of the world live impoverished
and dull lives!

452
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:16,044
Why do we always try to bring
everything to something else?

453
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:20,758
What else will we pull out now?
sexism, racism, class struggle?

454
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,552
Well, you're certainly unique,
Herr Kushemski.

455
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:26,680
If I were you, I would be careful.

456
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:31,393
Your ideal woman could prove
more cruel than desired.

457
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,771
I am ready to take the risk.

458
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:37,649
I know what she is...
A supersensual person.

459
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,651
An ascetic of pleasure.

460
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:43,697
And you, Frau von Vanda Dunayev,
who or what are you?

461
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:45,532
I am a pagan.

462
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:48,577
Does that mean I'm young,
beautiful, rich...

463
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:51,538
.. and by that account able to derive 
more benefits than possible to others.

464
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,665
I do not deny anything.

465
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,335
I have the utmost respect for your principles.

466
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,421
I beg your pardon, but I do not care
for your respect.

467
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,048
I shall love the man in whom I take delight...

468
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,592
.. and take pleasure from the man 
who will make me happy...

469
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:08,055
.. but only until he ceases to
make me happy and then I'll find another.

470
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:11,600
For a man there is no greater cruelty
than the infidelity of a woman.

471
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:14,478
For a woman, it gets worse:
forced loyalty.

472
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:17,940
- I can move?
- Yes, yes... go ahead, move.

473
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,489
In our society...

474
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:29,076
woman can have power except through the intercession of a man.

475
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:32,746
What will become of the woman,
when she becomes equal to men?

476
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,249
When she becomes herself?

477
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:39,878
The Little Vanda is way
ahead of her time!

478
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:43,757
How do you know all the lines?

479
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:47,636
- I don't know. I learn quickly.
- You know all the text by heart!

480
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,640
You had said that Vanda
is very much in place in spite of what?

481
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:54,601
- Of the principles she professes.
- There are those. - Yes

482
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,854
According to her Vanda does not believe in all these stories.

483
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:59,982
'what it says...
Women's Rights, blah blah blah...

484
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,025
But she does, jerk7,
She has character, a mind of her own.

485
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,736
As said: "
the principles she professes" and not "her principles."

486
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:08,657
I think I very much liked the alliteration:
"of the principles she professes."

487
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,534
I see!

488
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,245
He sold his soul for alliteration.

489
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,414
'true, I plead guilty.

490
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:19,167
Just between us, Thomas,
she is a true tomboy.

491
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,546
If you allow, I would say that...

492
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:25,674
You are better than a pagan.
Seems to me you are a goddess.

493
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:28,176
- Really? And what?
- Venus.

494
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:31,138
And Vanda?
Is Venus really me or am I making this up?

495
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:35,309
Venus took the likeness of a 
human to come to haunt him?

496
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,311
Not really.

497
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:41,273
- Or rather, not exactly.
- Okay, it's so, and she wanted it.

498
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,568
- She wants it to be ambivalent.
- Ambiguous. - Yes, that one.

499
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:47,529
In fact it is the story of "The Bacchae."

500
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,574
Exactly.
What was "The Bacchae"?

501
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,328
- It's an old play, right?
- It's a very old play.

502
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:58,540
"Citizens of Corinth.
I stand before you a Testiculus...

503
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,835
.. a poor mortal cursed by the gods for his offenses...

504
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,339
.. and totally fucked up till the end of time."

505
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:08,467
- It's this kind of play?
- Yes

506
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:12,971
Dionysus descends to Earth and is the arrogant king of Thebes...

507
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:16,475
A quivering jelly dressed as a woman.
- It looks exciting.

508
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:21,104
After that, the wild women of Thebes
The Bacchae, broke him in pieces.

509
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:25,108
- And Dionysus returns to his home, triumphant.
- I think I saw it.

510
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:28,070
In our case, however, it is not
Dionysus but Aphrodite.

511
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,738
Of course.
Who is that?

512
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:32,491
- She is the Greek version of Venus.
- But it is the same person.

513
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:36,119
 The same goddess.
- Hail Aphrodite!

514
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:39,873
Hail, oh Aphrodite.
Am I unbearably pedantic?

515
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,750
Yes, but I find it cute.

516
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:44,962
Yes.

517
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,384
What do we do?

518
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:55,889
Seems to me a goddess...

519
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,350
Really? What?

520
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,769
Venus.

521
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:03,772
But Venus can rule only in a world of slaves.

522
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:06,274
 Then I'd better find one.

523
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:09,903
 Would you like to be my slave,
Kushemski Herr Doktor?

524
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,530
I already am.

525
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:16,493
I became your slave
the moment you entered this room.

526
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:19,162
Really? Are you already in love with me?

527
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,248
Deeply.

528
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:25,293
I am suffering as if I knew it all along.

529
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:29,006
- Submit to me.
- Stand up straight and turn away from me.

530
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:32,134
I must confess this intrigues me.

531
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:35,303
I love your frankness and the clarity of your thought.

532
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:38,515
From a physical point of view,
You have charms, no doubt.

533
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,518
But if a man submits himself to me, I set a trap...

534
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:44,187
I don't care about traps. 
Love me!

535
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:49,067
- You see? He has already begun to give orders. 
- Marry me!

536
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,528
I am a frivolous woman,
Herr Kushemski.

537
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:55,323
To love me, you will have to give proof of great courage
.

538
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:58,326
- I have already explained my principles.
- I do not care.

539
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,787
- I want you to be my wife.
- You do not know anything about me.

540
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,081
- I submit to you
- That's absurd.

541
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:06,668
I'll give you complete power over me,
for eternity.

542
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,796
Do with me what you wish.

543
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:14,676
- I submit, hit me if you want.
- This is unexpected news to me.

544
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,722
- Let's try it a new way.
- What way?

545
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:21,349
- Put yourself center stage upstage.
- No, I'm fine here.

546
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,435
You should move there!

547
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:26,855
Take the power and stand in a position of power.

548
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,318
OK. Continue.

549
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:38,325
- This is unexpected news to me.
- This isn't working.

550
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,619
Do not move, try it here.

551
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,997
I'll give you complete power over me
for eternity, unconditionally.

552
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:47,125
Do with me what you want.
I submit.

553
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,960
Hit me if you want.

554
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:52,756
- This is unexpected news to me.
- You don't even pretend to try?

555
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,717
You wanted me to go here,
So I went here.

556
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,469
It's just an audition.

557
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:00,764
I am listening also to see if you agree.

558
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,141
Do what I say and stay there.

559
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:06,978
I'll give you complete power over me
for eternity, unconditionally.

560
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:09,356
Do with me what you want.
I submit.

561
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:13,026
- You can hit me if you want.
- This unexpected news to me.

562
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:16,530
- You're right, it's better.
- Continue.

563
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,243
What do you want in the depths of your heart?

564
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:23,286
To belong to you...

565
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:25,997
..
to disappear in essence sublime...

566
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,666
.. to dress you and undress you...

567
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,502
.. to offer you stockings,
to put on your shoes .. .

568
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,170
.. to no longer have my own will.

569
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:35,423
 And that you call that love?
- It's the only love there is.

570
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:40,011
In love, as in politics
only one of the parties must have the power.

571
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:43,181
One must be the hammer and the other the anvil.

572
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:47,144
I gladly accept
to be the anvil.

573
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,150
Enough.

574
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:55,569
Go on, I like it!

575
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:59,531
Thomas, you are intelligence,
especially with regard to women.

576
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:03,326
- You really understand women.
- Yes, yes... years of study.

577
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:07,581
- Where was I?
- You are an anvil.

578
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:13,795
Vanda, I try
my pain is your pleasure.

579
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:17,591
You should not ever let
the feelings of others dominate.

580
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:20,594
The servant of his mistress lives to serve her.

581
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,346
I submit, squeeze me like a lemon.

582
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:24,931
You are incredible.

583
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:28,351
If you do not want me as a husband,
take me as a slave.

584
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,854
Treat me with divine cruelty.

585
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,315
Why should I mistreat those who love me?

586
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:36,109
- But I'd love it even more.
- I do not want to be adored.

587
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,987
All women want to be worshiped, as our Creator.

588
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:42,490
I am created! I am ruined!
I am reduced to a thing!

589
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,743
CELLPHONE RINGS

590
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,746
One moment, please excuse me.

591
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,635
 Hello? Yes

592
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:07,599
No, they are not out yet.

593
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:11,394
It's all right.

594
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,356
It's all good just...

595
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,524
I don't know.

596
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,777
At times, eh?

597
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:22,530
I'll call you when I get out?

598
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:25,033
Yeah, me too, my love.

599
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,285
- Yeah, so...
 Yes, all right.

600
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,162
Excuse me, huh?

601
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,916
You're not listening.

602
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:37,796
 This time it's a temporary agency,
maybe they have something for me?

603
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:42,634
A typist? Night work
in a major law firm.

604
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,511
The contract is for tomorrow.
Blah Blah Blah

605
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:48,139
 I don't know!

606
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:50,308
What will be, will be.

607
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,560
That's life. That's life little one. Bye!

608
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:57,399
- Crazy!
- Your better half?

609
00:37:57,441 --> 00:38:00,694
 You think so?
- What did you call him?

610
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:04,030
- I don't know... asshole?
- Ah, okay.

611
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:08,076
- You wonder why I lied to you?
- No, it does not concern me.

612
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:10,078
Why do you say that Vanda?

613
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:13,456
"I do not deny anything,
There are other fish in the sea."

614
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:16,835
- Why do you talk like that?
- You're the hammer, he's the anvil.

615
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:19,421
What should I say?
"Yes, dear, whatever you want"?

616
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,715
This has nothing to do with love, but with
my ass.

617
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,925
If I say so,
You have to take it.

618
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,594
- This is dialogue from the play.
- Oh yeah?

619
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:29,222
You're making fun of me?

620
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:33,101
- I do not know, do you think I am?
- Will you stop pretending.

621
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,478
For once I cannot tell
what you are thinking.

622
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,731
Talking with you is more complicated than
doing the tango.

623
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:40,358
Want to go for a coffee?

624
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,736
Why do you say that?

625
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,363
- You're hitting on me?
- Absolutely not!

626
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,741
I'm just offering you a coffee.

627
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:51,745
- But it's symbolic coffee.
- No, no, it's a real coffee.

628
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:55,457
What would she say if your wife saw you give me a "real coffee"?

629
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,626
- I'm not married.
- Ah yes...

630
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,379
I thought so before the phone call.

631
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,506
- It was my fiancee.
- It's the same thing.

632
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,633
You would think that?
In an interview you said:

633
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:08,636
"The theater is the best way to get girls into bed."

634
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:11,139
Don't tell me that you read that stuff.

635
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:14,601
I was young,
it was my first interview.

636
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:17,395
- You have never been married?
- Never.

637
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:23,234
- You still live with your mother?
- I'm weird, but not that weird.

638
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:25,987
I fox fur her passion?

639
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:29,407
- No, it's love.
- She is really strange.

640
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,618
 And I want my woman to be my muse.

641
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:35,038
So your girlfriend has a pair of wings and everything else?

642
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:38,041
In the vision of love one must jump completely in.

643
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,877
 And she dives right in?
- Yes, like a fish...

644
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,005
.. with fireworks,
dizziness and thunder.

645
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:48,134
So, coffee yes? Or no coffee?

646
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:54,057
I can't conceive of a man giving me
his life only by becoming my slave.

647
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:57,685
I would say that we are not at all compatible
Herr Kushemski.

648
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,938
We will cancel each other out.

649
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:03,566
And I would say that we are made for each other.

650
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:07,821
Is that not what he feels, Vanda?
Is not that what you feel?

651
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:12,659
I propose we try a contract, as in business.

652
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:16,830
You will have a year to prove
you are the man I need.

653
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,290
- A year is a long time.
- I have not finished yet.

654
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:25,296
- I beg your pardon.
- You will be my slave for a year.

655
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:29,801
So you prepared everything.

656
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,345
You planned everything before entering here.

657
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,807
- Do you believe that?
- Stop being naive.

658
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:39,477
- It's you, you're the author of this. 
- I'm not sure I had everything ready.

659
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,729
I'm being sincere, I swear.

660
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:44,190
So you wanted this? You seem ambivalent.

661
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:46,234
- Ambiguous.
- That yes.

662
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:48,611
Or is it a slut you crave,
ready to enjoy everything.

663
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:51,489
A craving whore?
I had never thought of you as that.

664
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,450
It can be even more complicated.

665
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:55,994
"Be my slave for a year
and then I'll let you fuck me."

666
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,871
- She is always ambivalent, right?
- Ambiguous.

667
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:02,208
- Ambiguous. - From my point of view, rather than 
Kushemski's...

668
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:05,211
This could be his last chance. Maybe the only one.

669
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,754
And to do what?

670
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,507
- To live.
- Ok, good.

671
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:12,135
He loves the whip and wants to know if
she likes it too.

672
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:15,263
- He told her this?
- She understands him.

673
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:19,893
He is a weirdo and she is an object,
like all women of the 1800s.

674
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,770
What?

675
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:26,774
Who is she, then,
Frau Vanda Jourdain?

676
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:29,277
- I am a pagan.
- No, I'm serious.

677
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:31,529
Try again.

678
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,907
Where did you get this?
What is your story?

679
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:39,037
Daughter of the military, grew up around soldiers,
An orphan.

680
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:42,165
Where have you been? ln which cities
and which countries?

681
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:47,545
I will write a contract stipulating
that you will be my slave for a year.

682
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,425
- I'll be at your command.
- Done deal.

683
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:56,054
Let's shake on it.

684
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:17,408
- There's a real Greek at the hotel.
 A Greek? - Yes

685
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,827
He's from Athens.

686
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:24,457
Mounts a stallion as white as snow
wearing boots and black leather.

687
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,834
I want you to get me the number of his room.

688
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,921
- But, Vanda...
 What is it?

689
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:33,675
- Already reluctant to obey me?
- I beg your pardon.

690
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:39,722
Tomorrow I'll wait in the birch forest, near the statue of Aphrodite.


691
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:43,726
- At what time?  
Wait for me until such time as I decide to come.

692
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:49,107
- Very good. - Don't come
without the room number of the Greek.

693
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,735
Now kiss my foot.

694
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,613
And he kneels and kisses her foot.

695
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,867
I love this part, it is very direct.

696
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,746
Pass me my fur now.

697
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:31,608
S�verin, how will it end?

698
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:37,739
This depends only on you, Vanda
Frau von Dunayev, not on me.

699
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,409
Thanks for the coffee, slave.

700
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:47,040
OK, I'm leaving right now.
A coffee sounds good.

701
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:51,544
That was intense.
The handshake was electric.

702
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:55,006
The happiness of a time when people were more introverted.

703
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:58,176
A simple conversation emanated eroticism.

704
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:01,512
Conversation.
The only thing to put between your teeth.

705
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:04,182
The book begins like this, right?

706
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:06,559
- The book?
- Yes

707
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,311
Where is the beginning scene...

708
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:11,648
.. when Venus appears to be naked
wearing fur in front of the fireplace?

709
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:17,028
- You've read "The Venus in Furs"?
- I looked it over.

710
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:20,448
When you said you did not know about it
you lied.

711
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:22,909
OK, I lied a little.

712
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:27,455
- Why didn't you keep that scene?
- I did not know how to use it.

713
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:30,833
Just put it at the beginning, before the
guy with Vanda.

714
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:33,920
You can not think of doing
"The Venus in Furs" without Venus.

715
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:36,047
You can use the same actress
for Vanda and Venus.

716
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:40,301
- Naked on stage? That's no problem.
- Yes, I'll think about it.

717
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:43,721
- Why don't we improvise? 
It'll give you some ideas. 
- How?

718
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:45,723
You have to change the lights.

719
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:48,935
- Where we are at the beginning of the play?
- In Kushemski's room...

720
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:50,937
.. in the middle of the night.

721
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:53,731
Ok, middle of the night, two in the
morning.

722
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:56,567
Let's turn them down a little...

723
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:04,742
Fire in the fireplace,
side garden. There!

724
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:07,829
Yes, very well.

725
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:13,459
Kushemski What are you doing?

726
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:17,880
- I do not know... is he in bed?
- What a fantasy!

727
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:20,508
Too obvious?

728
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:22,885
He is reading
when he meets Vanda.

729
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:26,264
Do not read too early,
we are not in the library.

730
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:30,518
Perhaps he could be writing in his diary.

731
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:32,019
I like that.

732
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,612
Yes

733
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,573
OK I'm Venus.

734
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:29,076
Ah shit, who cares?

735
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:35,416
 Face me as if you were naked.
- You're hitting on me?

736
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:38,294
Imagine that I'm your girlfriend
and this is unexpected.

737
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:41,798
- Ah, it's the first time I've done this.
- You say that to all the girls.

738
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,050
Yes, but for me it is the truth.

739
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:47,720
The fire in the fireplace comes to life, we see Venus naked...

740
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:51,182
.. lasciviously wrapped in a fur coat...
- Uh huh

741
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,559
Now wrap me in fur.

742
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:55,436
You're the director.

743
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:04,237
I said "lascivious."

744
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,959
Now you go to the desk.

745
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:33,391
Become the character.

746
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,480
Write in his diary.

747
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,362
- Really write.
- I'm doing it.

748
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:49,991
But out loud, we are in the theater!
If not, how do we know who he is?

749
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:52,285
We are at the beginning of the play.

750
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:55,288
The scene is illuminated little by little...

751
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:58,165
We hear the ticking of a grandfather clock.

752
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,668
Tic tac...

753
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:03,379
.. tick...

754
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:06,549
.. tick...

755
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:08,926
.. tic tac!

756
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:13,180
October 22, 1870.

757
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,434
Two in the morning.

758
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:21,314
Living in a spa...

759
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:26,152
.. surrounded by forests and mountains.

760
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:30,656
It's a moonless night,
darkness and silence reign.

761
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:35,453
(VANDA WHISTLING)
A Moment! I hear a sparrow.

762
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,705
- A nightingale.
- A nightingale.

763
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:40,666
VANDA MEOWS

764
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,712
And the cry of a cat in heat.

765
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:50,343
I feel terribly alone...

766
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:55,431
.. unhappy, unfulfilled.

767
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:57,600
(In German) Good evening Sir.

768
00:48:57,684 --> 00:49:00,811
Well, the Germans have invaded again?

769
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:03,606
 I hope I did not disturb you.

770
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,444
Absolutely not.

771
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:15,993
Hail, Aphrodite.

772
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:20,122
- So now you have not forgotten me?
- Forget?

773
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:23,501
My most dear old enemy?

774
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:26,212
- You're too kind.
- Yes

775
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:29,757
I do not have a right to a little kiss?

776
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:45,606
- That's better, but Thomas...
- Oh! - I told Thomas? Oops!

777
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:50,277
It's so cold in here!

778
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:53,990
Every time I come to visit you,
I am cold.

779
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:56,784
(SNEEZES) See?

780
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:58,786
I already catching a cold.

781
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:01,914
If you dodidn't pass the time
walking around naked...

782
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:05,001
However, I am Venus,
I have to be naked.

783
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:07,169
It is part of the job.

784
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:13,426
Do not you want to take off those rough clothes
and come here and hold me close to you?

785
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:16,929
There is so much room here under my fur.

786
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:19,432
No, thank you.

787
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:25,062
I brought this vision to you,
directly from Olympus.

788
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:27,148
It is divine!

789
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:30,693
- Do you not see the label?
Made in Olympus.  

790
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:33,070
Why should I care about your vision?

791
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:36,782
I know your small flaw.

792
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:39,827
You're not interested in women.

793
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:44,331
You just like their fur,
should marry an otter.

794
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:47,793
I understand it better with an otter
than with a woman.

795
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:51,714
But if I spread legs under my mink...

796
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,592
.. would you refuse a little love?

797
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:57,094
 Is it t 'a little' love you suggest?

798
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,597
No, it is the power that interests you.

799
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:02,308
- Dare you resist me?
- Yes, I dare.

800
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:06,479
S�f�rin, I want you on the ground,
at my feet.

801
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:08,981
- Beg me.
- Never.

802
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:14,612
You already belong to me and I will belong
until the end of time.

803
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:18,199
- Never.
- (In German) Goodbye my friend.

804
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:20,493
I'll be back.

805
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:23,621
And then, poof, she disappears.

806
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:26,082
 Whew!
- Not bad, eh?

807
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:30,336
- Not bad?... - You could 
write it down and put it in a play.

808
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:32,129
That's a good idea.

809
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:37,885
- In this context... - her accent 
could be like Marlene Dietrich.

810
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:40,513
Yes, that would work very well.

811
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:42,515
This gives a different picture of Kushemski.

812
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:47,019
Yes, in the middle of the night there is
a vision of Venus...

813
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:50,147
.. and then the next morning with Vanda:
"I saw her, I beg you."

814
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,149
We conclude by
lowering the lights...

815
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:55,653
.. and then when you get up in the morning again comes
knock, knock...

816
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:58,531
.. and then Venus reappears
disguised as Vanda.

817
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:01,283
- To take revenge.
- But yes, it's great!

818
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:05,037
 So are you?
- What?

819
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,541
 Are you he?

820
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:11,544
Kushemski - Novacek,
Novacek - Kushemski.

821
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:15,673
- No, not me.  
You said that there is a lot of you in there.

822
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,758
Then maybe you are Vanda?

823
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:22,179
- The play has nothing to do with me.
- Sure, you're just the author.

824
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,764
Oops, the adapter.

825
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,559
Type: "If a critic says that
that's me, kill him."

826
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:31,188
- I have the right to invent characters. 
- Of course adapter Novacek.

827
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:35,442
Just by chance you came across in the characters in a novel
about sadomasochism.

828
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:37,444
No, it's a famous book and I...

829
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:41,323
Didn't you experience this "unpredictable moment"
at the age of twelve?

830
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:43,659
- No.
- ln the library...

831
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:47,538
- No!
- With a cat.

832
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:53,043
No.

833
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:57,798
She's still waiting for your "big moment"?

834
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,925
It's not a damn bit like that!

835
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:05,806
I find the relationship between the two characters
both fascinating and complex. Very rich.

836
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:09,852
- Of course! 
- I love the emotional depth of the characters.

837
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:13,230
Don't you see more of
this kind of thing nowadays.

838
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:15,983
Don't you see more of this kind
rage nowadays.

839
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:19,486
- I should submit it some friends of mine.
- Okay.

840
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:25,075
Very well, then I don't understand
anything about anything.

841
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:31,081
When you return home, your fiancee doesn't
tie you to the bed and whip you?

842
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:32,833
No.

843
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:36,253
You should ask her and see if your fiancee will do it.

844
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:39,215
- Stop calling her "fiancee."
- Excuse me.

845
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:42,134
Should I call her your better half?

846
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:46,513
- I don't like that very much. 
- Would you tell me if you were afraid?

847
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,599
This is not about us.

848
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:52,269
Let me guess about your...

849
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:55,481
Marie-C�cile.

850
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:58,776
Marie-C�cile. I bet she's younger than you.

851
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,528
Good deduction.

852
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:06,492
Definitely grew up in a nice little house
a good family in Provence.

853
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:12,748
- I bet from La Baule.
- Nantes, actually.

854
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:17,419
But I bet her family
spent the weekend in La Baule...

855
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:20,047
.. in a beautiful villa with a garden.

856
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:25,803
She goes sailing and loves seafood.

857
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,805
Yes, it's true.

858
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:32,643
She is tall, slightly authoritarian,
but without being disagreeable.

859
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:35,646
with wonderful hair...

860
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:40,067
.. Long legs and a nice pair of...

861
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:42,695
.. eyes.

862
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:44,697
A mind to be respected.

863
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:48,826
She went to preparatory school in Paris, of course
to Louis Le Grand.

864
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:51,912
Am I wrong?

865
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:55,291
 Henry IV, School of Economic Sciences
- And she has a doctorate?

866
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:58,961
- She is finishing her thesis in sociology.
- She has a dog?

867
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:02,214
Let's see... I would say a labrador.

868
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:05,676
It's called...

869
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:08,929
It has an unusual name that is a little 'intellectual.

870
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,223
- Bourdieu?
- Derrida.

871
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,851
You are not lacking in culture I see.

872
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:15,978
I bet that she's a blonde...

873
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:18,605
.. she likes a small seedy theater and has a Belgian cactus...

874
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,691
.. Not exactly the Com�die Fran�aise.

875
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:23,485
No, there is taste in her family.
Am I right?

876
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:26,488
Of course, I'm right. Good.

877
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:31,118
But she is an artist and you lost your head
over this Marie-C�cile...

878
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:33,370
.. and her sensitivity.

879
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:35,581
"You're perhaps the first man I have ever met...

880
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:38,208
.. who has a real sensitivity."

881
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:41,962
She loves books, the opera, the ballet
things like that.

882
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:44,757
In the evening, watch and talk about the Arts
last Goncourt...

883
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:47,885
.. and then fuck quietly.

884
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:51,597
Nothing is better than a quiet sex session
to relax.

885
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:54,975
But there's a voice that echoes in his head...

886
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,895
.. a voice that demands other things.

887
00:55:57,979 --> 00:56:00,606
I do not know what it is but it echoes.

888
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:02,900
Boom.

889
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,235
Boom.

890
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:07,613
Boom.

891
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:10,240
In the meantime you are happy.

892
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:13,494
You truly, truly love her...

893
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:16,789
.. and spend a quiet life looking Arty...

894
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:19,291
.. and talking about the latest Goncourt.

895
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:23,545
You will have children who will live
just like you and then you will die.

896
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:28,175
Shall we continue to read?

897
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:33,680
Yes, let's continue.

898
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:38,560
 The meeting in the birch forest? 
- Okay.

899
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:42,689
Let's pretend that's the statue of Venus.

900
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:45,150
Hail, Aphrodite.

901
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:47,569
Hail, Aphrodite...

902
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:53,719
re-read the text quickly?

903
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:55,596
No, S�verin.

904
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:57,764
No, no, this is not good.

905
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:01,268
All these stories of bondage and domination...

906
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:04,271
You have corrupted me with all this talk.

907
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:08,525
I am convinced that she would feel pleasure to dominate a man.

908
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:10,777
- No.
- Maybe even to torture.

909
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:13,238
- No.
- Admit it.

910
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:15,157
Not for me.

911
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:18,285
- How can I make you see reason?
- To hell with reason!

912
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:21,413
S�verin, do you really not understand?

913
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:25,250
You will never be
safe in the hands of a woman...

914
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:27,669
.. whoever she is.

915
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:30,547
But this play is sexist.
I want to yell!

916
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:33,383
What is so sexist?

917
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:35,802
"You will never be safe
in the hands of a woman."

918
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:37,804
- But it's in the book...
- you can't change anything?

919
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:40,807
- The book is sexist.
- The book is not sexist.

920
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:45,312
- On the contrary, it is something...
- A classic of world literature.

921
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:48,023
- That's what you were about to say?
- Not exactly.

922
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:49,942
And this?

923
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:52,402
We do not have a certain Titian here, sweetheart.

924
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:55,155
- It's a nice BDSM porno.
- What the...?

925
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:58,825
This story is nothing more than a big cliche. 
- And why is it a chiche?

926
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:01,954
He is spanked and suddenly
he likes to be whipped?

927
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:04,957
- It's what happened to the author.
- And it happened to you? 
- No!

928
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:07,084
Then what?

929
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:10,587
For me it is a play about two people who are
united eternally.

930
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:12,214
their hearts are handcuffed to each other.

931
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:15,717
- Shackled in perversion.
- No, handcuffed in passion.

932
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:17,719
- Yes, but it's his passion!
- They have a chemistry...

933
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:19,721
.. it's the meeting of two people
lighting fire to the powder.

934
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:21,682
This is the struggle of the sexes, and classes.

935
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:25,561
Vanda is an innocent woman who runs into a pervert.

936
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:28,814
- But then you do not understand anything!
- Vanda says: "He has corrupted me!"

937
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:32,317
And what if if her thirst for domination
was asleep inside her?

938
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,361
Kushemski? If he was to awaken it?

939
00:59:34,445 --> 00:59:36,863
And if she was simply a woman?

940
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:39,575
This text brochure looks like it was written by
an old Austrian misogynist.

941
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:42,119
He forces her to a game of power
and then blames her.

942
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:43,745
- That's not it.
- That's exactly it!

943
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:46,623
- How?
- Look at the end for example. 
- Yes?

944
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:48,458
Vanda tells the Greek to whip him...

945
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:50,252
Kushemski .. then leaves him there with his cock in hand...

946
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:52,879
.. and it would be her fault even though he was the one to want it?

947
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:57,009
No, I think that little Kushemski
has the hots for the Greek.

948
00:59:57,135 --> 01:00:00,387
I wonder how you can be so bitchy at this point.

949
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:02,514
How can you interpret Vanda so well...

950
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:06,143
.. and then be bitchy at this point?

951
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,521
Stupid cocksucking actress!

952
01:00:09,647 --> 01:00:11,982
What a cunt!

953
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,655
Shit!

954
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:35,797
- I'm sorry.
- Excuse me?

955
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,800
 I'm sorry, I screwed up.

956
01:00:39,927 --> 01:00:42,387
Yes, but what is said is said.

957
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:46,058
Let's say that the meaning of the play is
"beware of your desires."

958
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:48,518
Since you knock on this door...

959
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:52,314
here is the argument of the play...
.. you do not take the piss out of a goddess:

960
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:54,316
.. so to speak.

961
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:55,942
 So to speak.

962
01:00:57,570 --> 01:01:00,447
What is the modern way of saying "so to speak"?

963
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:03,784
"asshole".

964
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:05,702
If you say so.

965
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:11,708
Luckily goddesses do not exist
otherwise we would be in deep shit.

966
01:01:14,587 --> 01:01:16,838
Okay, you're right.

967
01:01:16,964 --> 01:01:18,840
I accept everything you said.

968
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:23,053
Can we... can we continue?

969
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:33,355
Please Vanda.

970
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:56,336
You do not understand that you
will never be safe in the hands of a woman?

971
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:57,879
Whoever she is.

972
01:01:57,964 --> 01:02:01,007
We are two adventurers, Vanda.

973
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:04,094
Let's explore the limits of human nature.

974
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:05,887
You're sick.

975
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:09,891
You have been poisoned by the countess and 
now suffer the effects.

976
01:02:10,017 --> 01:02:13,478
- But she adores effects like me.
- No. ..

977
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:16,857
You like having complete power over me. 
- No.

978
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:19,651
Your desires are my orders.

979
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:22,779
I beg and crawl at your feet.

980
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,781
Do with me whatever you want.

981
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:28,160
You are a mad visionary, a fanatic.

982
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:30,746
Who is willing to do anything,
to realize his dream.

983
01:02:30,788 --> 01:02:35,041
- But my dream is you.
- Get away from me, S�verin.

984
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:37,502
Before it is too late.

985
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:42,174
- Do you love me?
- I do not know.

986
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:46,052
Decide, do something
to be convinced.

987
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:52,309
- How? - 
Do what all lovers do.

988
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:55,270
- Let me suffer.
- This disgusts me.

989
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:57,898
And I hate to pretend.

990
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:00,817
I'm not the countess, your aunt.
I am myself.

991
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:02,694
Repeat the line, the challenge.

992
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:06,156
I'm not the countess, your aunt.
I am myself.

993
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:09,075
- Again, get angry!
- What do you want from me, Thomas?

994
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:11,953
I'm not your fucking aunt,
I am me! What do you want?

995
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:15,165
- I don't know!!
- This time it is no longer the play.

996
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:17,584
- I want a lot more.
- But you're not her.

997
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:20,212
I'm just a poor bitch who needs the work.

998
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:23,799
And I'm not your aunt, I am me.
Okay so?

999
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:27,302
Yeah, okay. Very well.

1000
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:31,681
I can't do this part.
It's too hard.

1001
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:34,100
Don't go, please. Vanda. Stay here.

1002
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:39,689
Say "I beg you."

1003
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:43,193
I beg you.

1004
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:47,739
- You're bad.
- I'm completely in your power.

1005
01:03:48,616 --> 01:03:53,245
Liar, you are not in my power, 
I am in your hands.

1006
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:57,374
You're supposed to be my slave
but it is you who dominates me.

1007
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,125
- It's true isn't it?
- What?

1008
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:02,963
You never stop saying that I have the power
but you've got it.

1009
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:05,590
The more he submits the more he dominates.

1010
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:07,384
It's complex, yes.

1011
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:18,478
Here is the contract that we talked about.

1012
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:22,983
It establishes that you agree to a test
of total submission.

1013
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:24,901
You will be my slave.

1014
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:28,154
Completely give up your own identity.

1015
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:32,242
Your body, your soul,
your honor will all belong to me.

1016
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:34,035
Forever.

1017
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:37,998
Sign at the bottom.

1018
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:42,419
Well?

1019
01:04:42,503 --> 01:04:45,672
I thought my commitment would be for a year.

1020
01:04:45,798 --> 01:04:48,925
- What? You are trying to dictate conditions to me?
- Can I re-read the contract?

1021
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:51,428
Why? Maybe you don't trust me?

1022
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:53,513
Sign.

1023
01:05:06,652 --> 01:05:08,153
Good.

1024
01:05:11,949 --> 01:05:14,159
From now on you will call me Madame...

1025
01:05:14,201 --> 01:05:17,287
.. and you will speak only when allow it.

1026
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:28,798
You will serve me meals
and await my orders in the hallway.

1027
01:05:30,718 --> 01:05:33,929
In the morning you will dress me
and you will dress me in the evening.

1028
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:37,098
Bring me my socks
and put on my shoes.

1029
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:39,684
- I'll call you Thomas.
- But I'm Gregoir in the text.

1030
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:43,104
I changed it. Henceforth, I will call you Thomas.

1031
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:46,942
You will serve as my valet and bring my coat with my coat of arms.

1032
01:05:46,984 --> 01:05:51,321
And as a gentleman... 
- You have to keep your word.

1033
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:54,491
Don't we have a signed a contract which states that you are my slave?

1034
01:05:54,575 --> 01:05:57,869
- But I'm not your slave, I'm your valet.
- The difference escapes me.

1035
01:05:57,995 --> 01:06:01,873
- Is it a game?
- This is what I am.

1036
01:06:01,999 --> 01:06:04,209
I'm Stubborn, strong-willed, greedy...

1037
01:06:04,251 --> 01:06:06,836
.. and when I start something,
I see it through to the end.

1038
01:06:06,879 --> 01:06:09,631
The more you resist, the more I persist.

1039
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:12,759
But, deep down, your nature is noble.

1040
01:06:12,843 --> 01:06:16,471
What do you know about my nature
aside from what you think you know?

1041
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:19,724
Please forgive me, I was despicable.

1042
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:22,769
Give me your passport and your money.

1043
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:28,274
- But ..
- give it to me!

1044
01:06:34,907 --> 01:06:36,908
Tomorrow we leave for Florence.

1045
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:41,871
I will travel in first class, you in third.

1046
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:45,792
- In third class?
- You will eat and sleep with the servants.

1047
01:06:47,795 --> 01:06:51,756
- What is it, Thomas? You have something to say?
- Where will this end?

1048
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:54,801
End?
We havn't even started.

1049
01:06:54,927 --> 01:06:57,012
But Vanda, I...

1050
01:06:57,054 --> 01:06:59,180
She slaps him...

1051
01:07:00,891 --> 01:07:02,892
.. kisses him...

1052
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:07,689
.. and caresses his cheek...

1053
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:11,151
Did I hurt you, my dear?

1054
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:13,570
Yes, you are deliciously evil.

1055
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:15,321
Well.

1056
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:23,455
What did you learn about the handsome Greek?

1057
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:26,207
His name is Alexis, he is a count.

1058
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:29,961
- He's beautiful, isn't he?
- Ah, he's fascinating.

1059
01:07:30,087 --> 01:07:32,714
Kushemski, you said you had a crush on the Greek.

1060
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:43,183
I have to take a room next to his tonight.

1061
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:47,353
I will allow Count Alexis to seduce me.

1062
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:50,732
Ah, but Vanda...

1063
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:55,695
What is it?
Am I not free to do what I please?

1064
01:07:56,864 --> 01:07:59,365
- You turns me on.
- Silence, dog!

1065
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:02,577
Bring me a rod of birch wood.

1066
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:17,258
He takes the branch to her...

1067
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:23,389
Listen to this hiss?

1068
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:26,518
This sound vibrates my nerves
like a tuning fork.

1069
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:29,521
I have only one desire:
to hear you groan under the blows.

1070
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:31,856
Feel Herr Doktor Kushemski what I crave...

1071
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:35,485
.. crying like a little girl,
my heart leaps in my chest.

1072
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:37,403
The air is hot.

1073
01:08:37,488 --> 01:08:41,032
What have you done? What have you done?
Bla bla bla bla bla bla!

1074
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:43,368
How bla bla bla?
- No. What do you mean?

1075
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:46,121
Vanda turns into evil witch.

1076
01:08:46,163 --> 01:08:49,415
Air glowing,
my nerves are a tuning fork...

1077
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:52,877
Let's have lightning and drum rolls while we're at.

1078
01:08:55,256 --> 01:08:57,549
Tomas, I really, really love it so much.

1079
01:08:57,633 --> 01:09:01,302
I like it too, 
but this has already been seen and reviewed.

1080
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:04,556
What do you mean?

1081
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,684
The play is... my play!

1082
01:09:07,768 --> 01:09:11,813
It's a superb play
and no one will make me change my mind.

1083
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:13,815
Damn!

1084
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:17,318
You don't know anything...

1085
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:27,537
I do not believe, I refuse
to demolish my work...

1086
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:30,290
.. Whether you are in the play or not!
Go to hell.

1087
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:32,208
Okay, it's you who decides.

1088
01:09:34,211 --> 01:09:37,797
She takes a knife and puts it to his throat.

1089
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:44,345
God, how I hate you.

1090
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:47,348
What are you doing? What's going on?

1091
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:50,602
Do you think I don't understand your game?

1092
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:53,438
Do you think you can use me, I could subdue...

1093
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:55,607
I do not want anything of the kind,
I swear.

1094
01:09:55,691 --> 01:10:00,111
If you only knew how delicious this sensation is.

1095
01:10:01,488 --> 01:10:03,114
You know what?

1096
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,949
I'll go to the Labour Court...

1097
01:10:04,992 
-since you have has not yet decided if I will
get this part.

1098
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:10,955
- I'd like to give you the part.
- Now you say this.

1099
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:14,375
Will you put it in writing?
CELLPHONE RINGS

1100
01:10:14,501 --> 01:10:16,502
Wait, I'm sorry.

1101
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:19,380
- Yes?
- Fuck you, Marie-C�cile!

1102
01:10:19,506 --> 01:10:21,382
No, I'm still here.

1103
01:10:21,508 --> 01:10:25,345
- I have things to finish.
- He's fucking me Marie-C�cile! 

1104
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:28,389
He's buggering me on all fours on the stage. 
- Soon.

1105
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:31,392
He fucks like a Labrador in heat!

1106
01:10:32,394 --> 01:10:36,147
Yes, soon.
You start eating without me, then I'll come. OK?

1107
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:42,278
But it's leftovers?
Leg of lamb from yesterday?

1108
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:48,243
I'll call you when I leave and then...
Later, yes.

1109
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:08,930
Yeah, okay.

1110
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:12,141
I don't know.

1111
01:11:12,184 --> 01:11:15,311
I'll be back when I get back, okay?

1112
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:18,273
Fuck you. Ciao.

1113
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:23,653
- Excuse me. -
There was no one on the line, right?

1114
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:26,030
 What?
- You pretended.

1115
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:30,159
- You pretended to talk to someone.
- I was talking with my sweetheart.

1116
01:11:30,202 --> 01:11:34,080
- Who is this guy?
- Who says it's a guy?

1117
01:11:37,209 --> 01:11:39,335
And why did you pretend?

1118
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:41,421
 According to you?

1119
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:44,966
I didn't like that I had to answer the phone.

1120
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:48,219
Type  "female revenge"?
Or something like that?

1121
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,680
 Something like this, yes.

1122
01:11:52,057 --> 01:11:55,101
Any other director I would have already jumped on him.

1123
01:11:55,185 --> 01:11:59,105
- I am not "any other director."
- Bullshit.

1124
01:11:59,189 --> 01:12:02,233
If you thought you could, you would have already done it.

1125
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:04,235
Not true.

1126
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,238
 Though I him I allowed?

1127
01:12:10,242 --> 01:12:13,745
How did you know all those things about Marie-Cecile?

1128
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:16,956
 I met her at the gym.
- You saw her!

1129
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:22,003
She seemed very nice and very beautiful. Really.

1130
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:26,883
We were talking while we were changing in the locker room...

1131
01:12:26,967 --> 01:12:30,011
.. Series "talks between girls."

1132
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:31,763
I told her I'm an actress...

1133
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:35,725
.. But I also am a private detective, 
on the side.

1134
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:38,519
And she told me about her boyfriend.

1135
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:41,147
A very mysterious type, a writer.

1136
01:12:42,107 --> 01:12:45,360
She gave me a bit 'of money
to investigate you...

1137
01:12:45,402 --> 01:12:49,739
.. to find out who you are, if you
seriously love her, things like that.

1138
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:53,242
I do prenuptial agreements...

1139
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:59,040
I do research on criminal record and financial status.

1140
01:13:07,174 --> 01:13:10,635
I have to meet her later at a hotel...

1141
01:13:10,677 --> 01:13:13,262
.. and give her a full account.

1142
01:13:14,431 --> 01:13:16,891
She has a nice body, huh? Congratulations

1143
01:13:18,185 --> 01:13:20,311
You're amazing!

1144
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:25,316
- When a man tells me that I sniff a trap. 
- Ah, touch�.

1145
01:13:29,696 --> 01:13:34,409
- Marie-C�cile never showers at the gym.  
 - Ah, no?

1146
01:13:34,451 --> 01:13:36,661
Yet she was wet.

1147
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,705
Let's finish?

1148
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,708
Yes

1149
01:13:42,793 --> 01:13:44,710
 Put this on.

1150
01:14:14,241 --> 01:14:17,368
 Thomas, you made me wait.
- I'm sorry, ma'am.

1151
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:19,454
I cleaned the silverware.

1152
01:14:19,496 --> 01:14:22,457
You really look stylish wearing your uniform.

1153
01:14:22,499 --> 01:14:25,209
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Turn around.

1154
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:30,715
Oh yes. Definitely irresistible.

1155
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:35,011
I might even forget that you are a valet.

1156
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:40,016
- But something is missing.
- Where's this coming from? It's not on...

1157
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:42,518
I'm improvising.

1158
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:45,021
 Something's missing.

1159
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:01,412
Yes, really chic!

1160
01:15:01,538 --> 01:15:03,372
The icing on the cake.

1161
01:15:03,415 --> 01:15:07,168
- You like it?
- It is very nice my lady.

1162
01:15:07,294 --> 01:15:11,672
I could almost fall in love with you when I see you with this collar.

1163
01:15:11,798 --> 01:15:15,760
"Almost fall in love"?
This means that you don't love me!

1164
01:15:15,802 --> 01:15:19,180
I get bored, I whine constantly.

1165
01:15:19,306 --> 01:15:21,390
Your Count? Is he?

1166
01:15:21,433 --> 01:15:22,934
You're in love with him?

1167
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:25,019
He followed me to Florence!

1168
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:28,272
He does not love you. He just wants you,
as he wanted a thousand others.

1169
01:15:28,315 --> 01:15:31,150
Insolent animal!
How dare you speak to me in that tone?

1170
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:34,278
- Bring me my boots.
- Yes, ma'am.

1171
01:15:36,657 --> 01:15:39,825
Not there. In the bag... idiot.

1172
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:41,953
Yes, ma'am.

1173
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:45,540
From now on you will call me Mistress.
It is more degrading.

1174
01:15:45,582 --> 01:15:47,333
Yes, Mistress.

1175
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:04,183
 Do you like my boots?

1176
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:07,979
Yes, Mistress.

1177
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:10,314
 Do you like them?

1178
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:13,109
Yes, Mistress.

1179
01:16:13,193 --> 01:16:15,194
And my legs.

1180
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:17,822
Yes, Mistress.

1181
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:02,927
Tomorrow maybe I will tie you
to the fig tree that stands in the garden...

1182
01:18:02,969 --> 01:18:06,055
.. and sting you with my golden clasp.

1183
01:18:08,475 --> 01:18:12,687
Or I could attach you
naked to a plow...

1184
01:18:12,729 --> 01:18:15,189
.. and lash you.

1185
01:18:19,611 --> 01:18:22,113
Would you like this?

1186
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:23,989
Yes, Mistress.

1187
01:18:24,991 --> 01:18:27,952
I am very pleased with you, Thomas.

1188
01:18:27,994 --> 01:18:30,955
I might even give you a piece of candy.

1189
01:18:32,082 --> 01:18:34,125
Will there be anything else?

1190
01:18:34,251 --> 01:18:36,377
Yes, one last thing.

1191
01:18:36,503 --> 01:18:40,005
Call your Marie-C�cile
tonight and tell her you are not coming home.

1192
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:43,384
- I can't do that.
- Ah, no?

1193
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:47,096
You can't?

1194
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:49,348
No, I can't.

1195
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:06,282
Don't lie to her.

1196
01:19:12,038 --> 01:19:15,291
 (Marie-C�cile) Hello?
- Yes, Marie-Cecile? It's me.

1197
01:19:15,375 --> 01:19:17,126
Tonight I cannot come home.

1198
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:20,379
- Tonight I cannot come home.
- Do not explain why.

1199
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:23,007
- No, I can not tell you why.
- Tell her goodbye.

1200
01:19:23,049 --> 01:19:25,050
Goodbye.

1201
01:19:25,135 --> 01:19:27,678
Hang up and turn off your cell phone.

1202
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:36,187
Don't you feel great?

1203
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:39,440
Colluding here the two of us together...

1204
01:19:40,567 --> 01:19:42,818
This place is so nice.

1205
01:19:42,944 --> 01:19:45,029
And also so quiet.

1206
01:19:45,071 --> 01:19:49,450
I do not know even where I am. 
- But think about it.

1207
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:53,204
A new life ahead of you, of us.

1208
01:19:53,288 --> 01:19:55,331
There's just us.

1209
01:19:58,043 --> 01:20:00,336
We and your friend, the Count.

1210
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:04,340
Stop bothering me by speaking about him.

1211
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:07,218
Haven't I punished you enough?
here's the problem.

1212
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:11,931
Just when I wanted to take you in my arms.

1213
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:14,934
you were going to... really?

1214
01:20:14,976 --> 01:20:16,602
Come on.

1215
01:20:16,686 --> 01:20:18,354
Come here.

1216
01:20:26,988 --> 01:20:29,073
Take me in your arms.

1217
01:20:32,744 --> 01:20:34,578
You see?

1218
01:20:34,621 --> 01:20:40,251
For an hour I'll let you imagine you are free.

1219
01:20:41,461 --> 01:20:44,964
In the end you will understand that you are
what I want.

1220
01:20:45,006 --> 01:20:46,966
An animal.

1221
01:20:47,008 --> 01:20:48,968
An object.

1222
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:51,512
An empty space to fill.

1223
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:55,766
No, I will not allow it.

1224
01:20:56,893 --> 01:21:00,020
- I will not, I refuse.
- I beg your pardon?

1225
01:21:00,897 --> 01:21:03,399
- I wrote you a letter.
- A letter?

1226
01:21:04,609 --> 01:21:07,027
A "Dear John" letter, perhaps.

1227
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:11,782
"The degradation is too much,
you have already become unbearable."

1228
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:14,660
The degradation claiming you...

1229
01:21:14,744 --> 01:21:17,162
I can not recite this passage.

1230
01:21:17,247 --> 01:21:19,415
- I do not see that happening.
- How would it be?

1231
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:21,417
Yet it is clear enough.

1232
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:24,795
What should I do?
In your head as you see the scene?

1233
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,298
But it is the time when...
What was the line?

1234
01:21:27,382 --> 01:21:30,426
- "I wrote you a letter."
- A letter...

1235
01:21:31,928 --> 01:21:34,263
A "Dear John" letter, perhaps?

1236
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:38,058
- The degradation claiming you...
- Lay down a bit '.

1237
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:44,690
The degradation claiming you,
you've already become unbearable?

1238
01:21:44,816 --> 01:21:47,693
You have to listen to her for days...

1239
01:21:48,445 --> 01:21:51,155
.. you have been afraid to show it.

1240
01:21:51,197 --> 01:21:53,532
So? Where is it?

1241
01:21:53,575 --> 01:21:55,784
Show me this masterpiece.

1242
01:21:58,038 --> 01:22:01,081
A little 'fun
would not make me sick.

1243
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:04,084
That's great, Tom.
Are you strong.

1244
01:22:04,794 --> 01:22:06,545
You should do you Vanda.

1245
01:22:06,588 --> 01:22:08,297
No, no...

1246
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:10,424
But yes!

1247
01:22:10,467 --> 01:22:12,927
You have to be Vanda.

1248
01:22:13,970 --> 01:22:18,098
You understand her character better than me, you created her...

1249
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:20,100
.. you know her intimately.

1250
01:22:20,226 --> 01:22:23,479
- I do not know her lines.
- But of course you know them.

1251
01:22:27,734 --> 01:22:30,945
- Pay attention, S�verin.
- I do the best I can, Mistress.

1252
01:22:30,987 --> 01:22:33,864
But as usual your best is not up to par.

1253
01:22:48,088 --> 01:22:51,215
- Bring me my coat.
- Yes, Mistress.

1254
01:22:53,718 --> 01:22:56,720
Prepare a bottle of champagne and two cocktails.

1255
01:22:56,763 --> 01:22:59,390
The Count Alexis will arrive
at any moment.

1256
01:22:59,516 --> 01:23:01,725
- But mistress...
- If you don't like it, you can leave.

1257
01:23:02,268 --> 01:23:04,478
Far from my sight.

1258
01:23:04,521 --> 01:23:06,772
Your fur, Mistress.

1259
01:23:13,154 --> 01:23:16,156
You will marry the Count Alexis, Mistress?

1260
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:20,369
I will not lie anymore, S�verin.
That man makes me shudder.

1261
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:22,663
Great!

1262
01:23:22,747 --> 01:23:24,665
Wait!

1263
01:23:25,417 --> 01:23:27,376
Sit down.

1264
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:37,428
It lives in my thoughts,
I can not drive it away.

1265
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:32,357
It lives in my thoughts,
I can not drive it away.

1266
01:24:34,861 --> 01:24:37,362
- I'm suffering.
- You're magnificent.

1267
01:24:37,447 --> 01:24:40,616
- Still you love this suffering.
- Get up and come back a little later.

1268
01:24:56,758 --> 01:25:01,095
If you ask me to become your wife, I will say yes.

1269
01:25:01,137 --> 01:25:02,888
You are magical.

1270
01:25:06,726 --> 01:25:09,353
You know it's very jealous of you?

1271
01:25:11,272 --> 01:25:14,399
I told him everything about the two of us.

1272
01:25:14,484 --> 01:25:17,111
He probably has threatened to kill you.

1273
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:19,780
In fact...

1274
01:25:19,906 --> 01:25:22,032
- The Count hit you?
 Yes

1275
01:25:22,158 --> 01:25:25,786
- You liked it?
 Yes, it was sublime.

1276
01:25:25,912 --> 01:25:27,412
More intense.

1277
01:25:30,917 --> 01:25:35,295
- Yes, and it was sublime.
- Even more intense.

1278
01:25:35,421 --> 01:25:37,673
- He slapped you in the face?
- Yes

1279
01:25:37,799 --> 01:25:39,424
 And it was sublime.

1280
01:25:39,551 --> 01:25:42,386
- Oh!
- I'll kill you, both of you.

1281
01:25:42,428 --> 01:25:44,930
I tear out your heart,
throw it to the dogs!

1282
01:25:46,182 --> 01:25:48,183
You are cursed!

1283
01:25:48,268 --> 01:25:51,937
- What curse?
 Yes, kill me S�verin!

1284
01:25:52,063 --> 01:25:54,898
I'm sick of this comedy.

1285
01:25:54,941 --> 01:25:57,067
What comedy?

1286
01:25:57,944 --> 01:26:02,281
But how can you love me?
I was terrible with you.

1287
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:05,159
I have done everything to save you...

1288
01:26:05,201 --> 01:26:08,537
.. to heal,
to show you how much I love you.

1289
01:26:10,582 --> 01:26:12,207
All to no avail?

1290
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:14,334
None.

1291
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:18,714
It was just a game?
A play? And the contract?

1292
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:21,216
Oh, the contract...

1293
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:26,972
My little, sweet, silly...

1294
01:26:30,476 --> 01:26:34,354
S�verin,
I loved you from the first moment.

1295
01:26:35,356 --> 01:26:38,609
I could not tell you why. I am not who you think.

1296
01:26:38,693 --> 01:26:42,112
I am weak, and lost... 
don't you understand?

1297
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:43,989
Not bad.

1298
01:26:44,115 --> 01:26:46,617
It is I who should be submissive.

1299
01:26:46,743 --> 01:26:49,870
I who should be whipped and tied up.

1300
01:26:49,954 --> 01:26:53,498
 I think I will tie you to the statue
with a pair of your socks.

1301
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:56,877
 That's What you want, right?
- Yes, I beg you.

1302
01:27:01,507 --> 01:27:03,884
Do with me what you wish.

1303
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:10,265
- Promise to never leave me.
- I'll never leave you, I swear.

1304
01:27:21,277 --> 01:27:22,903
Turn around.

1305
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:41,046
The hands?

1306
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:48,637
I've dreamed of this moment ever since I met you.

1307
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:51,181
Louder, louder.

1308
01:27:51,307 --> 01:27:53,267
I humble myself.

1309
01:27:53,309 --> 01:27:56,520
Mortify, subdue me, I implore you.

1310
01:27:57,772 --> 01:27:59,773
Very well, Tom.

1311
01:27:59,816 --> 01:28:02,067
This should be really good.

1312
01:28:02,151 --> 01:28:05,445
This is great.
But you know what is the problem?

1313
01:28:05,571 --> 01:28:09,574
Whatever we say or do,
this piece is degrading.

1314
01:28:09,659 --> 01:28:12,327
It is an insult to women.
Your pornography.

1315
01:28:12,412 --> 01:28:16,665
- But what are you saying?
- A damsel in distress...

1316
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:19,334
.. a poor defenseless
bitch who humbles herself before a man:

1317
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:21,670
"Beat me, hurt me,
I'm just a woman."

1318
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:23,714
Holy cow!

1319
01:28:25,091 --> 01:28:28,051
- Damn!
- Are these emotions too strong?

1320
01:28:28,553 --> 01:28:30,095
That's good.

1321
01:28:30,221 --> 01:28:32,347
"I don't see this kind of anger these days."

1322
01:28:32,473 --> 01:28:33,974
But Vanda...

1323
01:28:35,101 --> 01:28:37,227
Thank me.

1324
01:28:37,812 --> 01:28:39,354
Thank you.

1325
01:28:40,106 --> 01:28:41,732
Thanks to whom?

1326
01:28:41,816 --> 01:28:43,734
Thank you, Mistress.

1327
01:28:44,736 --> 01:28:47,487
You thought you could dupe the stupid starlet, huh?

1328
01:28:47,613 --> 01:28:50,365
- To use her to satisfy your sick inclinations?
- No.

1329
01:28:50,491 --> 01:28:53,368
Like Frankenstein build yourself a little female of your own?

1330
01:28:53,494 --> 01:28:56,455
- You believed you could use me to humiliate you? 
- No, Vanda.

1331
01:28:56,497 --> 01:28:58,582
I swear!

1332
01:28:58,624 --> 01:29:02,252
- Thank you, Mistress.
- Thank you, goddess.

1333
01:29:03,004 --> 01:29:05,589
Thank you... goddess.
