Steven. Hello

2
- Sit down. - Roberto?

3
- I'm agitated, - Eh.

4
Are you agitated? Me too.

5
- Yes. - Very agitated.

6
- Ahh ... what are you drinking, coffee? - Coffee. Yup

7
- Do you do me fine with you? - I love it.

8
- You too? - I love.

9
- Steve! - Steven.

10
I love coffee.

11
What are you doing?

12
Well, relax, I'm a bit here. Maybe I smoke a cigarette

13
Coffee and cigarettes are good together. You think it's too much

14
I do not know, do you think she's drinking too much?

15
No. Coffee is good for health, do not you?

16
I enjoy drinking it before going to sleep.

17
I'll get a lot of it before. Accelerate your dreams.

18
Like in Indianopolis, with cameras on racing cars ... Everything runs fast, like dreams.

19
One dream after another, after another, after another.

20
The next day they ask me what I dreamed of.

21
I say, it would take so long. And I do not.

22
- Do you smoke? - Only when I drink ... coffee.

23
Do you know my mother?

24
- If I know your mother? - Yeah.

25
I do not know, but I do not think so.

26
- The coffee. They should freeze it, do not you find it? - Yup!

27
Put it in the ice tray and put in sticks for children.

28
So you get used to small ones .. Type icicle caffeine.

29
Very, I do not understand anything.

30
- Can you hear me? - Thing?

31
Can you hear me? There's a big casino here.

32
Do you have trouble hearing? We could swap seats.

33
Yes, thank you very much. Let's exchange.

34
Very well.

35
- Good? - I liked it before.

36
- Would you like ... - Are you sorry?

37
Sure. I also prefer ... yes.

38
Steve, yes.

39
- When do you go? - From the United States?

40
No, from here.

41
From here, oh ... I have to go away shortly. I have appointment from the dentist.

42
But I do not want to go. I do not like dentists.

43
- But I have to go, unfortunately.

44
- Yeah. - It's a piece that I'm not leaving.

45
Bravo, do not you go?

46
- I should, but I do not want it. - Well?

47
Steve, I'm free. Perfectly free.

48
Are you in my place?

49
Thanks so much.

50
- do you want to go to the denist? - I can go to your place.

51
Great.

52
- This is the address. - Good.

53
Good. Very well.

54
- The boy's name. - Yes, 4:30.

55
- Steven, thank you very much. - No problem.

56
- Do not you dry it? - No

57
An appointment from the dentist, what a beauty.

58
I have to go. Excuse me, Steve.

59
Steve, yes, I have to go to the dentist. - I'm late.

60
- Thanks, and sorry, I'm sorry. - But figured, do not be late.

61
- It was a pleasure. - For me, in a way.

62
What do we do in Memphis?

63
- It was your idea to come. - No, yours.

64
Is my idea? It was yours.

65
Very funny.

66
Do not smoke those cigarette cigarettes.

67
I hate you.

68
- So what? - What are you, a cawboy?

69
- I'm fine. Pure Tobacco. - No, this is pure stuff.

70
- This is the stupid pleasure of the cigarette. - It's overworked, are you crazy?

71
- I am not. - But shut up.

72
What do we do here? Full?

73
- Even.

74
- You are welcome? - Oh yes.

75
- Hey! - Shit! Sorry.

76
- Are you stupid, what are you doing? - Fuck, I'm sorry.

77
I would not even pay the bill. This place is terrible.

78
Do not you take anything else? Only...

79
- Let me sign in. - Only coffee and cigarettes?

80
It's not very healthy, you know?

81
- Do you bring some sandwich, something? - No.

82
Are you part of these? - No.

83
Are you brother and sister?

84
- Even.

85
Are twins?

86
- Even.

87
We are.

88
I imagined. Do you know who you remember?

89
- Who? - Heckel and Jeckel.

90
And what a fuck.

91
Do you know ... the talking girls?

92
However, who is the bad twin? It works like this, right?

93
- This cafe knows mushrooms. - It's true.

94
Which of the two has the bad air, according to you?

95
I think so, what do you say? He has bad eyes.

96
- I'm kidding. - It will be better for you.

97
You know, I thought of something, since you're twins.

98
- Have you been to Graceland? - No.

99
Oh, you should. Is strong.

100
- Is it a problem if I sit down? - Yup.

101
All right, sit down. Are you paused?

102
Not really, but the bar is empty. Do me a favor.

103
Do not move, cover it so your boss does not see me.

104
Is it bad or not?

105
I was thinking of one thing.

106
Did you know that Elvis Presley had a twin?

107
Yes, it's called Jesse Garon. Elvis's second name was Aron.

108
Aron, Garon. Anyway, did not everyone think he was dead?

109
For me...

110
the mother, expecting a son only, did not want to pull it on two.

111
He could not afford it,

112
So one gave it away.

113
So this Jesse grew up in Arkansas or Mississippi.

114
Without knowing having a brother. Until one day, in '68 or '69 ...

115
... while looking into the mirror, he said, "Caspita, I'm identical to Elvis."

116
He went to Memphis.

117
Elvis sees it and says, "You are my brother, I can not believe it!"

118
"What can I do for you?"

119
And his brother replied, "I do not know."

120
"It would be great to be you for a night."

121
Elvis had a concert, but singing sends us his brother.

122
He wanted to see if people dropped us. And for misery, even hearing them was the same.

123
Then Elvis came up with an idea.

124
"I'm tired of being on tour, I'm sending him."

125
Big mistake! His brother started to go to Las Vegas ...

126
... to wear collars, white suits and cloaks, you know?

127
Elvis would never do it. And it was his brother what grew fat.

128
Filling up with fried and fried breads.

129
And the Colonel said, "Take it off her feet, she can not do Elvis anymore"

130
And they began to blush it with pills. They say they made it out.

131
Then? Conclusion? How does history end?

132
- Are you fan of Elvis? - No.

133
Want to hear something about Elvis? I'll tell you, okay?

134
Have you ever heard of Otis Blackwell? - No

135
- Of Junior Parker? - No

136
I was sure. Elvis stole their music.

137
He gave them $ 10 each, to them and to all the other black musicians.

138
- Here's what I think of Elvis. - And it all marries my theory.

139
For me it was not Elvis, he was his brother.

140
If so, we're in place, right?

141
His phrase I prefer is, "The only thing a nigger can do is to lick my shoes."

142
The King can not have said it. I think he was his bad twin.

143
Danny, what are you doing down there? You have to serve the tables, walk.

144
- I'll be right back. - Do not throw yourself out, buddy.

145
Danny! Poof buzzurro.

146
Cin Cin, health.

147
I feel a strange odor.

148
Hey! Did you put my shirt on?

149
No I do not think so.

150
I think so, instead. It smells like me.

151
You know what you know?

152
I know about myself, and this one knows about you.

153
- I also know about myself. - But this one knows about you.

154
Because I am me.

155
Is that my shirt?

156
- Why do you always copy me? - I will not copy you.

157
- Why do not you have your own style? - Of course I got it.

158
No, you always copy me. Your style is mine, because it cops me.

159
- It's my style. - No, it is not.

160
The service sucks, coffee also, music makes vomiting.

161
Hey. Those are my shoes!

162
- They are mine. - They are mine.

163
- Those are mine. - They are the others.

164
Bullshit.

165
- Hey. - Hey Tom.

166
- Good. - Well, I'm glad you did it.

167
- Here you are.

168
Call me Jim.

169
That is, friends call me Jim. Or Jimmy, or Iggy.

170
Call me J ... no, call me Iggy, Iggy.

171
Okay, for me it's indifferent. Jim or Iggy

172
Iggy. Call me Iggy.

173
I'm sorry to be late, Jim. Four cars one on the other.

174
It was a birth, this morning at nine o'clock.

175
I saved several lives, I was on the highway, it was ...

176
There is nothing worse than improvising an operation.

177
You know, without the right irons we become butcheries.

178
I did a trachon with a bureau ...

179
I was very busy.

180
Wait a second, are you a doctor?

181
Yes, I'm a doctor.

182
Music and medicine are my two great passions.

183
... And at the point where they overlap, there is me.

184
A lot of people say they feel a lot in my music, I do not know ...

185
- Well, yes, I know ... - Really?

186
- Yeah, I can see it. - Yup?

187
Wow !. Sent .. It's the organization, the whole. Humanity, I think.

188
The humanity that is inside, of course. The feeling

189
So you've had a beautiful full day. Yes, one morning by a doctor

190
- Everybody safe? - All in shape.

191
- Well ... - Are you here for a long time, or am I wrong?

192
Yes a bit'. I drank a coffee

193
- I see. - I also ordered it for you.

194
Me too?

195
In short, all right. It's right?

196
Sure, of course, okay ... coffee

197
- Go for coffee. - Okay.

198
Strength, take some coffee.

199
Coffee is served.

200
Are your cigarettes?

201
They were already there when I arrived.

202
- You do not smoke, do not you? - Yeah. I quit.

203
- Me too. Madonna. - Closed.

204
All right, finally. After 25 years!

205
End.

206
- I did the load of energy.

207
- I feel great.

208
Since I stopped, I mean ... it's all. Refurbished.

209
- Centrally, bang! You know? - Me too.

210
I'm feeling a lot of pain for the other idiots who still smoke, you know?

211
- They have no willpower. - It's their soothing.

212
The good thing is that when it stops, it's that having stopped ...

213
... I can smoke it, so I stopped.

214
You know, it's all an ornamental thing ...

215
It's not true. I did not aspire either.

216
Do you want to make me company?

217
- But yes, so I stopped ... - Well,

218
- Okay. Okay. - Since you've stopped. - You can smoke it. - Yeah.

219
Of course I can, yes.

220
Hey, thank you!

221
Did you understand what I mean? Now that I've stopped ...

222
Damn it, coffee and cigarettes.

223
Perfect Couple.

224
Unbeatable.

225
We are the generation of "coffee and cigarettes" if you think so well.

226
That of the 40s was "cake and coffee".

227
Like Gianni and Pinotto. They always ordered cake and coffee.

228
Yes, yes, like Gianni and Pinotto! They always ordered cake and coffee.

229
A coffee! A piece of cake and a coffee!

230
What are you waiting for?

231
come here often?

232
Yes, it is the place I frequent most of all.

233
I was wondering why there are no disks in the jukebox.

234
Well, if you do not like it ... we can go to Mexican fast-food. Maybe it's your kind.

235
What would you like, excuse me? You're saying, What are the fast-food type?

236
No. I said, if you do not like it ... You said you did not like it.

237
No, no. I did not say this.

238
We can go to that bar on the corner.

239
Maybe it's more than your own, I would not know.

240
But who said it? I do not want to go to the bar at the corner.

241
I'm fine here.

242
Coffee is good at that bar.

243
Do you like their coffee?

244
I drink it, I like it, do not you like it?

245
Of course yes. I like their coffee.

246
- It's fine stuff, great class. - Yes, it's good.

247
It's good coffee in that bar.

248
Wow, I was almost forgetting. Listen.

249
The other day I played with a drummer in Los Angeles.

250
It's called Giant Robo.

251
You do not know how strong it is, I thought of you.

252
Maybe you could ... I think you should hear it! Yes eh?

253
Why ... do you think I need a professional drummer? Am I not good enough?

254
Are you saying this?

255
No. No. I was just ... you know. I wanted to talk to you.

256
I just wanted to talk to you, because it's a real phenomenon.

257
It's hard, metallic, it's strong. And so I thought, '' ah, though. ''

258
Are you trying to tell me that I need a drummer?

259
What do I need?

260
That the percussion of my record is sucking? What are you trying to say?

261
Oh, forget it. Leave it alone.

262
You know what? I think I have to go.

263
You have to go?

264
Maybe another coffee? Another sig ...

265
I would like. But no, I have to go. I really have to go.

266
My wife, alone in a motel.

267
- I understand ... - Yes, you know ...

268
Call her and tell her to come here. He drinks a coffee, smokes a couple of cigarettes.

269
- Do not smoke. - It's the willpower.

270
- I got it. - I do not want you to start ...

271
- No ... I do not want it to start.

272
This is something among us. Right, yes ...

273
Well, let's ... every now and then we keep crossing.

274
I'll think about it, I'll think about you.

275
Now I have to go. Eh, I know so ...

276
See you soon. Yup.

277
I was hoping you could stop more.

278
- Damn, me, I ... Now that we were starting to warm up. - I have to go.

279
- Okay Jim.

280
- Next. - Yes, next time.

281
- Be a good boy. - You too.

282
There are not even his disks.

283
- You're a fucking whore, do you know that? - What is it now?

284
I can not believe you keep smoking that shit! It's incredible.

285
Vinny, they'll shoot you. They will kill you. Believe me.

286
Did you come to the world to break?

287
You said you stopped, but keep on spending a fortune.

288
And the fucking multinationals are enriched! And then you will be cancer.

289
So those doctors and dudes will also be enriched.

290
And even the seagulls!

291
All because you keep smoking, fucking shit.

292
I can not do anything about it. I'm fucking dependent, okay?

293
So go to coffee and cigarettes.

294
Is that how you dine? Does not do very well, you know?

295
You also drink coffee, so do not break the whips!

296
Vinny, I've already had lunch.

297
I'm on diet, okay? What balls.

298
Here's my son's delinquent.

299
Give me a favor, do not tell your mother.

300
But what the fuck am I saying? That smokes like a steam locomotive.

301
How is he going?

302
It's not a chatter, is not it?

303
Lately not. It's silent

304
I gave you $ 10 last night, what did you do to him?

305
I've just given you 5.

306
Look, you'll still have one. Closed.

307
Do not you hug me? For $ 6 I do not even win a hug?

308
You must be fucking your brain! All right, come on, you do ...

309
But bought something to eat, something healthy.

310
Yes, like your father. Coffee and cigarettes!

311
Oh, but what the fuck are you saying?

312
Look how much fucking coffee you drink!

313
You got to get a fucking cock full.

314
And with this? They always give me a whole pot.

315
I like coffee. I charge her.

316
You charge her! You're a fucking sick! Caffeine.

317
Caffeine Sick. Why do not you drink coffee?

318
- Yes and then?

319
Then maybe you should try to give up.

320
I'm not a kid of renunciation. Fuckin 'fuckin'.

321
What balls, my son again.

322
How much did you spend?

323
For dried peas and a drink?

324
- What's in the bag? - Chinese peas.

325
No?

326
Japanese?

327
Chinese, Japanese ... always the same thing.

328
Assaggy one.

329
My god knows black pepper!

330
Give it a little ...

331
Small bastard! Did you see? He wanted to poison me!

332
But no, Joe. Listen to me. Those are so dear to me.

333
They are delicious, they have a special taste.

334
Taste a dick.

335
Oh God, still?

336
How do I light a cigarette to torment me, fuck!

337
Do you know what? You're really a fucking whore.

338
I'll thank the great multinationals of tobacco ... ... when they'll bury you.

339
Did I ever tell you you're worse than a fucking wife?

340
You can not even smoke a cigarette in holy peace.

341
Sorry Miss. Umm ... Can I have more coffee?

342
Ahh, if he did not do it was better.

343
It had the right color, the temperature. It was perfect

344
Sorry.

345
Hello.

346
Excuse me, excuse me for coffee.

347
Sorry. Is it called Gloria? No.

348
Why did I think maybe ... It's probably not the friend of ...

349
Sorry.

350
Can I bring you something else?

351
A sandwich, something to eat ... ... along with coffee?

352
Coffee and cigarettes is not a very healthy lunch.

353
It's not my lunch, okay?

354
Excuse me.

355
Alex.

356
You scared me.

357
How's it going, Isaach?

358
All right? Very well.

359
I'm happy to see you.

360
I was so tired of staying in Paris. You can not imagine.

361
Sit down.

362
I'm glad you called me.

363
It's a lot we do not see. No?

364
I'll take you a coffee. All right? Of course, thank you.

365
So is everything okay?

366
Yes. It's all right, really fine.

367
I'm fine.

368
Are you sure everything is okay?

369
Yes. It's all right.

370
And how are you?

371
I? All right.

372
Not at all, but pretty well.

373
I'm delighted to see you.

374
Me too.

375
Since it was quite a while we did not see it ...

376
... and you called me out of nowhere by saying "let's see". I thought you got hurt in some trouble.

377
No. I just wanted to see you, all here.

378
Me too. I wanted to see you too.

379
Are you sure there is nothing that is worrying about you?

380
And why,

381
Must there be something for something? Of course not.

382
But when you called me, I thought there was something.

383
Something that maybe ... you need to tell me. Here, all here.

384
Isaach. Everything is alright. Really

385
Okay?

386
Are you sure?

387
Are you crazy, Isaach?

388
Sure that there is nothing ...

389
of which do you want to lighten up?

390
Do I have to invent something? If you want I can invent something bad.

391
No, we would miss ... I do not want you to invent anything.

392
You know, I'm your best friend

393
I want you to feel completely free to tell me the truth.

394
Tell me what you're worried about.

395
Can you stop breaking the balls?

396
Okay, I understand. I do not insist.

397
Thank you.

398
You are welcome.

399
Isaach, there is no problem.

400
Well, I know I'm going.

401
Already?

402
Yes, if I do not want to talk to you, I do not want it to be a problem.

403
There are no problems, Isaach. I got it? No problem.

404
understand, but listen.

405
If you do not want to talk to me now, call me whenever you want ... do you understand?

406
Maybe now is not the best time for you.

407
I was happy to see you.

408
Yes me too.

409
I'm sorry to disappoint you. But there's nothing wrong with it.

410
All right.

411
I get it.

412
No, you did not understand.

413
Call me when you want, Alex.

414
See you, Isaach.

415
Soon.

416
- Hello, what a pleasure to see you again. - Me too.

417
Centuries have passed.

418
Already. When was the last time? A couple of years ago in Sidney, did not you?

419
Two years ago, really?

420
Wow. How was Jeff and Beryl?

421
Usually, as usual.

422
Faithful to their strangeness by parents.

423
Do not Mr. Cate and his son travel with you?

424
Well, unfortunately. I'm alone. I'll see them next week.

425
- They are fine? - Yes, yes. I also want a child sooner or later.

426
What can I bring you? What do you want, Catie?

427
Oh, could I have an espresso? In big cup.

428
Even for me an espresso, double. Thank you.

429
And could I have some milk apart? Can you warm it up?

430
- We will do our utmost to please you. - Thank you.

431
Sorry for the delay. I know you only have ten minutes.

432
Do not worry. I wish I could be more.

433
Do you sleep here? Or do you see only journalists here? Make your number and away.

434
Oh no. I sleep here. And I do the interviews.

435
we do it in my suite, it's more convenient.

436
Since they are preparing the next one, I thought it would be nice to see you here.

437
No, thanks to Shelly, here you can not ...

438
Stop it. Do you want them tell you not to smoke?

439
- Go, cousin. - Thank you.

440
In short, they give you this megasuite, and then use it for advertising?

441
Exact.

442
It seems ... shabby. Well, it's still a suite, they split the spaces.

443
Yes, but could they take one for you and another for press meetings?

444
It's a cheap production.

445
Sure.

446
But it's still shabby.

447
Can I bring you anything else?

448
- No thanks, just like that. - You're welcome.

449
And so ... Entering was complicated, I risked not to do so until they realized I was your cousin.

450
There are several paparazzi underneath.

451
They will follow you everywhere.

452
Everywhere there are so-called "celebrities," I suppose.

453
Of course it must be a nice break of balls at times, no?

454
Not for me, I'm free!

455
Virtually in panties, but free.

456
No one runs here, it's a safe place.

457
Except when they swap for you.

458
Once they made me into a club because they thought I was you.

459
Then they understood and kicked me out.

460
What a fucking thing.

461
Do not deny it, it must be beautiful.

462
You have everything. You have a husband, a nice kid.

463
Turn around the world, stay in fantastic hotels.

464
Frequent parties and receptions ...

465
Well, you know the saying, "The neighbor's grass is getting greener."

466
And how it is ...

467
Shit.

468
- Johnny. - Who?

469
Jimmy ... Tim ... Tommy. Sorry, how are you? Ah, Tommy ...

470
We left it two years ago.

471
Tommy. What a fucking head.

472
Now I'm with another, Lee. Remember?

473
Sounds in a group, I wrote to him.

474
It's an important part of my life.

475
Sorry, Shell, but you did not write to me.

476
Yeah fucking, I also sent you his CD!

477
Your secretary will not give it to you.

478
It does nothing, it does not matter. I know how your life is messed up

479
Do you remember when you sent it? No. One week you're at L.A,

480
Then in London, then in Sidney.

481
Fuck, every day you're in a different city.

482
I'd love to hear what she is doing, what kind of thing is it?

483
Well, it's stuff ...

484
It lasts ...

485
... industrial, vibrant ...

486
I do not think you'd appreciate it.

487
How is the group called? Squrl.

488
Scuali.

489
No. Sqürl. Here they say so.

490
S-ü-q-r-l. On U you will know it. Squrl.

491
Oh Sqürl. I get it.

492
Can I buy the CD, if I do not find what you sent me?

493
No not yet. In the sense, they have incised it for trial. Then...

494
But I think the record company will make it out at last.

495
I think.

496
I have to find that CD at all costs so that I can give it a lifetime.

497
You never will.

498
Shell, you're bad, really ...

499
It's the truth, you will not find it. If you say so.

500
Also because I remembered now that in fact ... I did not send it to you.

501
I just thought about shipping.

502
Oh, I almost forgot. This is for you.

503
Thank you, what is it?

504
Ah, though, it's expensive stuff! You will be ruined!

505
Awesome, thank you very much. It makes me comfortable.

506
It will make me look like a movie star.

507
- Cheers. - Cin cin, beautiful.

508
Catie, seriously, thank you for this visit.

509
No thank you.

510
And thank you for the gift.

511
Imagine, nothing.

512
It's a promotional gift, right?

513
They will give you everything for free, no. Jewelery, clothes ... probably even cars ...

514
No, cars have never given me. Every once in a while I get cosmetics for gift, but I thought ... ... I do not know, I wanted ...

515
I never had time to shop.

516
Do not worry, I like it. And then it's stuff you need

517
Do not you think it's fun? when something you can not afford ... ... costs a lot.

518
And when you can do it ... ... it's free.

519
Do not you feel absurd?

520
The world is a bit like that. In many ways.

521
Oh, about paparazzi,

522
The other day I saw your photos in the newspaper.

523
Do not even name me ...

524
How was she dressed?

525
Sorry...

526
Ready? Hi Lindsey.

527
I'm down at the bar, with my cousin, Shelly.

528
Already ready, really?

529
Okay, in a minute I'm up. Hello.

530
- Back to work? - Yeah.

531
You go back to the mine.

532
Do you want to come with me?

533
Nothing interesting, but if you want to come to me does a lot of pleasure.

534
Looking at you as you interview TV?

535
What's "Everything Doing"?

536
Yes. You could send me that CD, I have a letter.

537
You would not read it. Stop it, if I send it I'll read it.

538
- Now I have to go. - Yeah. - I'm sorry.

539
- Yeah. - It was nice to see you. - Yes. - Do you have my numbers? - Sure.

540
Be good. Hug me all.

541
And you hug the others.

542
Always remember me.

543
- Hello Catie. - We'll see Shell.

544
Put it all on my account, if you add more as well.

545
Maybe next time, Lou is there. Sure.

546
It's called Lee.

547
Ahh, sorry.

548
Can I have a double tequila, thanks? And the menu.

549
Excuse me, here's no smoking.

550
So, Jack, do not you talk about your Tesla coil?

551
You said you did not want to talk to me.

552
Yes I know. Before.

553
Now I do not know if I still want to talk about it.

554
Give Jack. You dragged her up here with your pickup truck.

555
Up, parlamene.

556
To create it, I have followed the inventions of the inventor, Nikola Tesla.

557
It's a transformer ... ... with two coils tuned to resonate.

558
In pairs it is a progressive transformer ... ... that converts current from low to high voltage, and vice versa. At high frequencies.

559
Do you remember that when we were young, did you have the mirror to make up for Barbie?

560
Yes, I remember it.

561
There was a small fluorescent lamp.

562
Well, Nikola Tesla invented that light.

563
Without him we would not have the alternating current ... ... the radio, the TV, the X-rays the induction motor, the particle accelerator, the laser.

564
Without him, there would be none of these things.

565
Not even the rock band, the Tesla.

566
Funny.

567
Tesla was a real genius.

568
If they had paid more attention to his ideas ... Now the world would be better: mass free communications Free shipping. Free energy for everyone.

569
That's why, in the end, they set it apart. For free energy.

570
He perceived the earth ... ... like an acoustic resonator.

571
Beautiful idea.

572
Then you show me how the coil works?

573
Sure.

574
You need these.

575
- Okay, are you ready for Meg? - Ready.

576
Fuck! Something must have been broken.

577
Nice stuff, though.

578
Yes, but it is not scheduled to stop. But to go on What will happen.

579
Is not that you burned the condenser?

580
No, I did not burn a condenser, Meg.

581
Maybe the difference was missed.

582
Yes, "The lifesaver."

583
I know what a difference! But it does not matter.

584
Do not pity with me.

585
Maybe the spinterometers are too distant on the induction spool.

586
It could be.

587
I think.

588
Yes, that's for that. You are right.

589
That's one thing I did not control.

590
Well, I go home to see how to fix it.

591
Tomorrow you go to bowling? Yes, I find it there.

592
Perfect, let's see it then.

593
Earth as an acoustic resonant conductor.

594
Ready? Ready, who are you?

595
Laura, hello. I'm Alfred Molina, I was looking for Steve Coogan.

596
Alfred Molina.

597
M-o-l-i-n-a.

598
The actor, of course. I wanted to be sure Steve remembers ...

599
... Ah yes, fine !.

600
Casomai would serve, my number is Ready?

601
Hello, Alfred? Hi, Steve.

602
Hello! I'm so glad you did it, sit down!

603
I was talking to Laura, your assistant, I was wondering if you were coming.

604
- Here I am. - Fantastic.

605
I ordered tea.

606
Do I make you from mom?

607
Let me stay, I'll do it from Mom alone.

608
Here is milk.

609
- A real tea! - Yeah ...

610
It's hard to get used to it.

611
I have this idea ... ... if I ever win an Oscar, or a GOlden Globe,

612
I want to take the satisfaction of teaching yankee to do a good job.

613
- Tea made as it should be. - cheers.

614
I love .. I love your overcoat.

615
It's a Westwood. Viv Westwood.

616
I have a weakness for British designers.

617
I do not know what goes on in the head of the American ones.

618
Are too much, how to say? Cautious.

619
Are not you hot? Outside there are 30 °.

620
- When I get out I'll take it off. - Oh.

621
- It's for air conditioning. - Right.

622
How much are you living here in L. A? It's been around 7 years.

623
- Wow. - I really like it here.

624
It's a long time now. I like to come out every now and then.

625
As I always say, it is nice to live but to go even further.

626
The palm trees ... The palms make me really crap.

627
It's not a place for everyone.

628
I do not mind, but I came especially for work.

629
It's nice ... it's nice to meet you, finally.

630
I have to admit that I'm your big fan.

631
All your shows, from things to TV and comedies ...

632
I have them all in the box. Let me ship it, great.

633
Thank you.

634
You know ... It's reciprocal, I know who you are.

635
Ah, thank you.

636
I've seen the TV series you did.

637
Really?

638
- Yeah. - Wow. Interesting.

639
- They canceled us. - I heard it.

640
Making comedies is a tough thing.

641
Yes. However, your career seems to be fine. That is, you've got a lot of success lately.

642
- Yeah. - And for this?

643
- Well, you know ... the usual rounds of meetings.

644
It's nice that "finally" ... ... people started to notice me.

645
- Have you made interesting offers? - Yup...

646
I have to confess ... you were great in '24 Hour '...

647
Really "24 Hour Party People". - It's a great job. - Thanks so much.

648
- A real bomb. - Has been...

649
And the reviews.

650
Fuck, they were all positive.

651
I am surprised that so many people have read cultural references of all kinds.

652
A kind of Manchester early 80s, the music scene ...

653
Surprising.

654
Because they were so many to have no references

655
Because of .. Maybe they know rock groups

656
But the whole, your character, the fact that he leads the show ...

657
Would you like a cigarette?

658
- I'm sorry, but I'm French. - Anyway, thank you.

659
I hold it for later.

660
Oh, okay.

661
Laura said ... ... that you were not in the skin for our encounter, but he did not tell me why.

662
I did not want to talk on the phone because it might seem strange.

663
Imagine what she would have thought, for her I was an alien.

664
The phone, never seen or heard at all, "I would like to talk to Steve Coogan"

665
But I wanted to see you personally.

666
Knowing they came for a while here ...

667
I thought it would be the perfect time ...

668
Anyway, I get to the point. I'm so excited!

669
I'm a premise ... I've always had a weakness for history. you know, and how people lived. ... and for all the events that take us from A to B.

670
The details of people's lives are full of epic ... ... full of epic qualities, do you follow me?

671
So I started this research.

672
And in short ... this is the result.

673
And to what extent is it? Is this a project already funded or being treated? How do you proceed?

674
No apology, which embarrassment ... is not ...

675
It's not work, work has nothing to do with it. It's not a script

676
It's a genealogy research. And what I've discovered is that ...

677
Mr Coogan? Yup?

678
- Is she right? - Yup.

679
I'm a big fan of it. Not so great at the end.

680
Could I ask for an autograph? - Sure. - How beautiful.

681
I was recognized, where did she want it?

682
A piece of paper will go more than well. Sin.

683
- Oh, no. Not here. - Sorry.

684
- I should have something in my bag. - Okay.

685
Give me a second.

686
Oh God, excuse me. It's all right.

687
- Give me another minute. - How much you want.

688
Here, here for courtesy. - Okay, what's your name? - Katy.

689
- Katy. - With Y.

690
Then "To Katy ..."

691
- Hello. - Alfred is also an actor.

692
- Yup? - Thank you, that's beautiful.

693
- Thanks so much. - Do not mention it.

694
- Wow ... - Let's go back to us.

695
I do not want to steal you too long. - I know you're very busy ... - Right.

696
As I was saying, I did genealogical research.

697
I did it just for my own interest ... I was not looking for anything special. And I came across this.

698
I'll let you short. Steve Coogan ...

699
Drumroll.

700
The fact is this.

701
We're cousins.

702
What do you mean? Artistically?

703
No. No. No! In the normal sense. We are cousins, relatives.

704
Wow. - Is not it fantastic? - Of course, but ... are you sure?

705
Things would be so ...

706
My grandpa is your pro-god.

707
And, going further, we have a common bis-bis-great-grandfather.

708
Ah, though! Of course my ancestors are Irish, but I also knew an Italian ...

709
Back to all! The Italian ancestor is our bis-bis-bis-great-grandfather, Giuseppe.

710
- Wow. - It's incredible?

711
There are a lot of details.

712
It is my field, more or less, I enjoy it. Fantastic.

713
For me it would be amazing to say that I'm relative to Steve Coogan.

714
And I, in turn, can say that I'm relative to Albert Molina.

715
Alfred.

716
Yes ... It's actually my grandmother ... ... the most ferret.

717
It will go into ecstasy. It's your fan. He adored you in ...

718
Boogie Nights.

719
Ah, yes, with shorts and doubles?

720
Once he spoke to me.

721
What a beauty, I understand that I find you a little lacking. But think about how many possibilities.

722
It's great, sorry, let's make the point.

723
We are both actors. We are cousins, and now it's crazy.

724
We could ... you know, work together.

725
We could make a movie.

726
We could make a movie about our story.

727
The story of two actors who find themselves cousins.

728
We could interpret ourselves.

729
We'll be Fred Molina and Coog ... We'll be cousins ​​in life and ... In the movie. Is fantastic!

730
It would be wonderful! Absolutely gorgeous!

731
Or no, I mean ... we could only attend.

732
One day we should go drinking a beer, think about that beauty.

733
Maybe make a nice vacation together. Only we two, you know, to know us.

734
You're not homosexual, right?

735
No. No. No, no. I'm, I'm married.

736
Even James I, if that's what you mean.

737
Sorry, I came out like this.

738
You say it and do not think about it, follow me? I see.

739
I know exactly what you were thinking.

740
If someone is presenting me saying he's my cousin ...

741
I would take it for crazy. But quiet, I'm not.

742
I think for me it's a fantastic, exciting excerpt.

743
Absolutely.

744
- I just wanted you to know. - Same to you.

745
What I ask you is to take note of this extraordinary fact. And ... to love me.

746
Agree.

747
Now I have to go.

748
I did not tell you ... ... but I have a meeting, I moved it. I see.

749
At Universal. Administrative, lenders.

750
So ... That would be, would ... - It's for you. - Good. It's yours.

751
I will check that I do not lose it. Sure.

752
You stay here for a couple of days, right?

753
If so we could see it again before your departure.

754
Yes, ah ... ok, check in my mental agenda

755
I'm afraid that's not possible.

756
For the days when I'm here, I'm always busy. - I see. - I'm very busy. Listen to me, no problem.

757
Give me your cell phone number, I'll call you back before you tell me.

758
There is a problem. On the ...

759
Here's a band system that's different ... ... from the English one. It's a casino, our cell phones

760
Our cell phones here do not work. Here in the US they are cell phone, practically. I understand, well ... give me your home number, I'll call you there.

761
- You have my assistant's number, right? - Yup.

762
Well then, we're in touch.

763
Could not you give me your home number?

764
Can I say no? There is absolutely nothing ... ... nothing personal. Only...

765
I never gave my house number to anyone.

766
Defense of personal space, always avoided ... It's a rule.

767
... And I always think, "Follow the rule." You understand, do not you?

768
Treat yourself to the rule. In fact, it's more a philosophy than a rule.

769
I can boast ... that I have refused my number ... ... to several V.I.P., in the past

770
Once I even refused to Sam Mendes, then you have company.

771
If it's okay for Sam Mendes, that's fine for me.

772
Exactly. - I know it's mine. - Sure, mine does not work.

773
Sorry, but I have to answer.

774
Ready?

775
Yes sure.

776
Spike, hello, how are you doing?

777
Yes, did you receive the message?

778
My agent wanted a confirmation.

779
No, the producer does not have a good reputation ... we have to be careful of everything, artistic integrity, and all that stuff there.

780
Otherwise everything will get out of hand.

781
How much are you asshole.

782
All right, Sunday is confirmed?

783
Fine, can we see you there?

784
Better as soon as possible. Perfect. A hug. Hi Spike.

785
- You have to apologize. - Do not even mention it.

786
But ... that ... was ... was Spike Lee?

787
Oh no, no, no. I do not know Spike Lee. No, it was Spike Jonze.

788
- Spike Jonze! - I love it! - He's a good man, Spike.

789
We are friends from a lifetime.

790
In addition to enthusiastic hikers. I boring you. No, no, no, continue.

791
We belong to a club. And on weekends we walk in the middle of nature.

792
He is a very convivial environmentalist.

793
Spike Jonze is a paladin of organic foods ... Jesus, I had never seen him in this light.

794
He prefers to be called "green". Like me, by the way.

795
Of course, I do not misunderstand ... ... it's beautiful, I love the trees.

796
Maybe there were more. Paper is used on both sides.

797
I'd love ... you know, I want to abolish the phone number rule ... it's bullshit.

798
Would it be rude to give it to you now?

799
Yes, that's fine. Right.

800
I have to go, sorry.

801
- I think in the bill. - Good.

802
'Fuck ...

803
Do you think RZA, where the fuck are you?

804
- Hey, hey, pace. - Bobby ...

805
Sorry, late, cousin. Do not worry, I was going to call you. What a fuck, an emergency visit.

806
- Emergency visit? - Yup.

807
The sons of Sophia and Sifu took the virus.

808
So I went to give her herbal medicines.

809
I took it away from milk and its derivatives, only citric acid ... ... should heal quickly.

810
Since you are a doctor? I've already said!

811
I've been studying alternative medicine for two years.

812
Ancient healing techniques, and such things.

813
Listen to this. There is a procedure I could run using a drill.

814
An electric drill. I'm serious.

815
And then, having made the DJ with my hands the cable.

816
Music and medicine for me go hand in hand.

817
Like two planets in orbit around the same sun.

818
- Do you want some tea? - Thanks, thank you

819
It's herbs, no caffeine.

820
No caffeine. It's absurd. Do not say that to me.

821
Trust, depression comes. And makes it irritable.

822
Accelerates your pulse, heartbeat, you understand?

823
And, worse, every time you have a coffee fill your body of shit.

824
Do you know the point? That's why I try to stay away.

825
I stopped with that shit. - Clean and healthy: no caffeine.

826
- To the Liquid Swords, cousin. - Bobby Digital.

827
- Wu-Tang forever. - Wu-Tang forever.

828
Does anyone still want coffee?

829
- The kitchen closes. - No, we do not poison ourselves with caffeine.

830
- Well? - No.

831
Do you know that caffeine causes delirium?

832
- Delirious? - Even in serious shape.

833
Now I understand everything! It may be this: delusion.

834
Are not you Bill Murray? This ... are you Bill Murray? Yes, I'm Bill Murray, but what's left between us, you know? You stay with us.

835
And between you two there is some connection?

836
Yes, we are cousins.

837
You're taking me for the ass, you're two planks.

838
- Piantagrane! - Del Wu-Tang clan.

839
Yes, Wu-Tang Clan.

840
- You are GZA, the genius. - Right.

841
- And you are RZA ... - Aka?

842
Bobby Digital. He knows everything about hip-hop, yo knows everything about hip-hop.

843
And you are Bill Murray.

844
"Resumed from head" Murray "Inculafantasmi" Murray

845
- Great name! - I know who I am, do not say it.

846
What does it mean, "Do not fuck him," you see you're Bill Murray.

847
There goes a lot of people here and they will recognize you. You're Bill Murray, of course.

848
Unless you dress, or something.

849
In a sense, I'm disguised.

850
Of course it's ugly, huh?

851
You're really a caffeine-dependent. What's left between us, cigars.

852
Before I quit ... ... I liked drinking it before going to sleep. Accelerated dreams.

853
Like in Indianapolis, with cameras on racing cars. And they too.

854
Everything went fast, like dreams.

855
- What a stupid thing. - She's stupid, huh?

856
I know a guy who freezes coffee, and puts us sticks ... and he's got a nice icicle. - A cauliflower icicle.

857
Damn ... I do not like much, Bill Murray!

858
No, it's not the flu, it's the smoker's cough.

859
That's what I was telling you. Nicotine. Nicotine interacts with the central nervous system, with the respiratory system.

860
Already in minimal doses gives paralysis.

861
- Really? - Yes, really.

862
It has been shown that only 50 milligrams ... can be fatal in a few minutes.

863
- And how many in a cigarette? - 3 milligrams.

864
And did you know that nicotine is also used as an insecticide? He kills the bugs. It's not bad if he kills the bugs, right?

865
Are you a bug, Bill Murray?

866
- Holy God, RZA, speak like my doctor. - He's a doctor ...

867
Currently specialized in ... alternative medicine.

868
That is, alternative to this country.

869
Well, make me a favor: Do not tell me I'm here.

870
- You can trust Bill Murray. - What's up, Bill Murray, hide you? Yes, more or less.

871
I start to think it's delirium.

872
- Severe delusions. - Women.

873
If you are going to run away, I have something to help you.

874
Here.

875
- Use whatever you want. - Caspita!

876
Stay calm, make you invisible. It's a good deal. You did not have to, it's amazing.

877
All for you, Bill

878
- Thank you. - Imagine.

879
I appreciate it.

880
Is fantastic.

881
Doctor, what can I do for this cough?

882
I was thinking about it now. Listen to me well.

883
- Take hydrogenated water. - We have it for the small wounds.

884
Mix half the hydrogen peroxide and half the tap water.

885
And then you make a gargle. Spit it.

886
Do not let her down, Bill Murray.

887
And if it does not work, try it with acid.

888
There I also have that.

889
- Thank you. - Imagine.

890
Thanks, I'll try it right away.

891
- Great. - Great.

892
Bill "rattinculo" Murray! Crazy.

893
- Yo. Yo. Yo. Yo, I'm three. - And with that?

894
Ghosts should arrive at three o'clock.

895
Be quiet, put your heart in peace. It's never punctual.

896
We'll be here all night. Do you think we can make a joint?

897
No, there's a lot of police here. But once we smoked here.

898
As long as Dirt Dog has not bothered the place.

899
I told him at Deflon "Do not let Dirt Dog get in here."

900
And then what?

901
- Let's go to the studio. - Right, check out? - Yeah. - It's gone then.

902
No account, we have limited credit. - He does not need money. - We still pay.

903
What do I do, leave him a tip?

904
You say he's using acid? I do not know, but let's get rid of the dick.

905
Are you okay, Taylor?

906
Not too much. What's up?

907
I do not know. I feel divorced from the world.

908
I lost contact with the world.

909
Do you know that Mahler song?

910
"I've Lost the Track Of The World"? (Of the world I have lost every trace) No.

911
It's one of the most beautiful ... and sad songs have never been written.

912
It almost seems to me to hear it.

913
Do you feel it?

914
Oh...

915
Now there is no more, but did you hear it before? I think so.

916
He resonated throughout the building.

917
Where we are? In Armory, Taylor. "In Armory, Taylor"

918
It has such a heavy sound.

919
The Armory.

920
Nikola Tesla.

921
He perceived Earth as a conductor ... ... of acoustic resonance.

922
I have no idea what you are talking about.

923
Could you explain yourself better?

924
Actually no. I have an idea, pretend that this coffee is champagne.

925
And why?

926
To celebrate life.

927
How rich, elegant people do.

928
Classy people.

929
I prefer Coffee, The Honest Cafe of the Proletarians.

930
You're so provincial, Bill. Do you know what your problem is?

931
Which?

932
You do not have "joie de vivre".

933
No?

934
No, and more, this coffee sucks.

935
You're right, it really sucks. Disgusting.

936
I propose a toast.

937
A toast to what?

938
Holy sky, boh ... in Paris

939
in the 1920s. Josephine Baker ... The Moulin Rouge ...

940
What's the matter ... what's up ... pa-pa ...

941
And even in New York. In the 70s. Towards the end.

942
Really? All right.

943
- Cheers. - Cheers.

944
"Délicieux", right?

945
Ahh, champagne. The God of the Gods!

946
Everything here your lunch? A coffee and a cigarette?

947
It is not very healthy.

948
We had lunch before. Before?

949
Now let's break, coffee break.

950
What a sadness.

951
And how long does this break?

952
A dozen minutes is almost over.

953
Tell me that's not true.

954
- So what?

955
I asked you to tell me that it is not true.

956
Tell you that this is not true?

957
Do nothing, do nothing, do nothing. Leave it alone.

958
I, anyway, have to rest.

959
Wake me up when the pause ends.

960
You have two short minutes to rest.

961
