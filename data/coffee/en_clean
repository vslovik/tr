Steven. Hi.
2
- Sit down. - Roberto?
3
- I'm all wound up. - Yeah.
4
You're wound up? I'm wound up, too.
5
- Yes. - All wound up.
6
- What are you drinking? Coffee? - Coffee, yes.
7
- Very good for me. For you? - I love coffee.
8
- You love it, too? - I love it.
9
- Steve. - Steven.
10
I love coffee.
11
What do you do?
12
You know, I just relax, sit around, maybe have a cigarette.
13
Cigarettes and coffee I think go together good.
14
You think you drink too much of it?
15
No. Coffee is good for health.
16
I like to drink before I go to sleep.
17
I drink a lot of coffee before I go to sleep so I can dream faster.
18
I can dream like when they put a camera on the Indy 500... when they put a camera in the car, and it's just whipping by like that.
19
Dream after dream after dream after dream.
20
People ask me the next day, what did you dream about?
21
I say, I don't have time. I don't have time to tell you this.
22
- Do you smoke? - Only when I drink coffee.
23
Do you know my mother?
24
- Do I know your mother? - Yeah.
25
I don't know. I don't think so.
26
- Coffee. They should freeze it, you know? - Yes.
27
Fill an ice-cube tray with coffee and put sticks in it, for kids.
28
So they can start when they're kids, when they're playing and stuff. Like a Popsicle. A caffeine Popsicle.
29
Very good. I don't understand nothing. Yes.
30
- Can you hear me? - What?
31
Can you hear me? It's very loud over here.
32
You having trouble hearing me? Maybe we should switch.
33
Yes, thank you very much. I'd like to switch.
34
Good here.
35
- Good? - I kind of liked it better over there.
36
- You go... - Do you mind?
37
Yes, me, too. I prefer, yes.
38
Steve, yes.
39
- When do you leave? - The United States?
40
No, here.
41
I have to leave soon, actually. I have a dentist appointment.
42
But I don't want to go. I don't like the dentist.
43
I gotta go, I guess.
44
- Yes. - I haven't gone in a while.
45
Good. You don't go?
46
- I should go, but I don't feel like going. - No?
47
I am free, very free.
48
You wanna go for me?
49
Thank you very much.
50
- You wanna go to the dentist? - Yes, I can go for you.
51
Great.
52
- Here's the address. - Good.
53
Good. Very good.
54
- The name of the guy. - Yeah, 4:30.
55
- Steven, thank you very much. - No problem.
56
- You don't mind? - No, thank you.
57
Dentist appointment, very good.
58
I have to go. I am sorry, Steve.
59
Steve, I have to go to the dentist. I am late.
60
- Thank you, excuse me. Sorry. - Take it easy, don't be late.
61
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too, in a way.
62
What are we doing in Memphis, anyway?
63
- It was your idea to come here. - Your idea.
64
It was my idea? It was your idea.
65
Very funny.
66
Don't smoke those sawdust cigarettes in here.
67
I hate those things.
68
- So what? - What are you, a cowboy?
69
- These are fresh. This is fresh tobacco. - No, this is fresh.
70
- This is the stupid dope fresh cigarettes. - That stuff is stale. What are you, crazy?
71
- I'm not crazy. - Shut up.
72
How we doing here? Need a refill?
73
- Yeah. - No.
74
- Sir? - Yes.
75
Shit. I'm sorry.
76
- Come on, what are you doing, man? - Damn, I'm sorry about that.
77
Let's not even pay the check. This place is terrible.
78
This all you're gonna have?
79
- Give me a light. - Just coffee and cigarettes?
80
That's not too healthy, is it now?
81
- Can I get you a sandwich or something? - No.
82
- Y'all from around here? - No.
83
Are you brother and sister?
84
- Yes. - No.
85
Are you two twins?
86
- Yes. - No.
87
Yes, we are.
88
I thought so. You know who y'all remind me of?
89
- Who? - Heckle and Jeckle.
90
Shit.
91
You know, the talking magpies?
92
Anyway, who's the evil twin? That's the way it works, right?
93
- This coffee tastes like mud. - Really.
94
Which one of us do you think looks like the evil one?
95
I'd say he's the evil one, right? He's got the evil eye.
96
- I'm only kidding. - You better be.
97
You know, I just thought of something, with you two being twins and all.
98
- Did y'all go to Graceland yet? - No.
99
You should. It's real cool.
100
- Mind if I sit down? - Yes, I do.
101
Yes, you can sit down. What are you, on a break?
102
Not really, but it's kind of slow. Tell you what, you can help me out.
103
Just stay right there. You got me covered and my boss can't see me.
104
It's his evil nature, right?
105
Anyway, what I just thought of,
106
do you know that Elvis Presley's got a twin brother?
107
Yeah, his name is Jesse Garon. You know, Elvis' middle name is Aaron.
108
Aaron, Garon. Anyway, everybody thinks that he died at birth.
109
But my theory is...
110
that his mother didn't wanna raise two kids. She wasn't expecting twins.
111
She couldn't afford to raise both.
112
She gave one away.
113
She just sent one off. So Jesse grew up in Arkansas, or Mississippi, or something.
114
So he didn't know he had a brother, Elvis. But one day, like, 1968 or '69...
115
he's looking at himself in the mirror and says, "Damn, I look like Elvis".
116
So he comes to Memphis, looks up Elvis.
117
Elvis sees him, he says, "Yeah, you're my brother. I can't believe it!"
118
"How you doing? What can I do for you?"
119
And his brother says, "Well, I don't know".
120
"Sure would be nice to be you for one night."
121
So Elvis had this concert where his brother sang.
122
They tried to see if they could trick people. Damn if he didn't sound like his brother!
123
Then Elvis had an idea.
124
I'm tired of the music scene. I'll send him out on tour.
125
Big mistake, because it was his brother who started to go to Vegas...
126
and wear them big collars, the white jumpsuits, and the capes.
127
Elvis wouldn't do that. And it was his brother who got really fat.
128
You know, eating those banana-fried butter sandwiches and all.
129
The Colonel said, "We gotta get rid of this guy. He can't be Elvis anymore."
130
So they started feeding him pills. I think they killed him.
131
So what? What are you saying? What's the punch line?
132
- Y'all are Elvis fans? - No.
133
You wanna hear something about Elvis? I'll tell you something about him.
134
- You ever heard of Otis Blackwell? - No, ma'am.
135
- You ever heard of Junior Parker? - No, ma'am.
136
Yeah, I didn't think so. You know, Elvis robbed their music, man.
137
He paid them $10 for their music, and all these other black musicians, too.
138
- That's what I think of Elvis. - Here's where my theory fits.
139
I don't think it was Elvis. I think it was his brother.
140
So in that case, it's all right?
141
My favorite Elvis quote is, "The only thing colors can do for me is shine my shoes".
142
I don't think the King said that. See, I think it was his evil twin.
143
Danny, what you doing over there? You got tables to wait on. Come on.
144
- I'll be right back. - Yeah, don't get fired, man.
145
Slaphappy hillbilly.
146
Cheers.
147
Something smells funny in here.
148
Is that my shirt you got on?
149
No, I don't think so.
150
Yeah, I think it is. This doesn't smell like me.
151
Yeah? What do you smell like?
152
I smell like me, and this doesn't smell like me.
153
- I smell like me, too. - But this smells like you.
154
That's because I am me.
155
Is that my shirt?
156
- Why you always copying me, anyway? - I'm not copying you.
157
- Why don't you get your own style? - I have my own style.
158
No, you're always copying me. Your style is my style because you copy it.
159
- It's my style. - No, it's not your style.
160
Service is bad, the coffee is bad, the music sucks.
161
Those are my shoes.
162
- These are my shoes. - Those are my shoes.
163
- These are my shoes. - Those are my other shoes.
164
Bullshit.
165
- Hey. - Hey, Tom.
166
- All right. - I'm glad you could make it.
167
You are here.
168
You know, you can call me Jim.
169
I mean, you know, my friends call me Jim, or Jimmy, or Iggy, or Jiggy.
170
Call me Iggy.
171
Okay, all right, whichever way you go. I'll go either way, Jim or Iggy...
172
You call me Iggy.
173
Look, I'm sorry I'm late, Jim. Boy, four-car pileup.
174
I delivered a baby this morning at about 9:00.
175
I was saving lives, I was out there on the highway, it was...
176
You know, there's nothing worse than roadside surgery.
177
You don't have your own tools, and it's just... It's murder.
178
I performed a tracheotomy with a ballpoint pen and...
179
I've been busy.
180
Wait a minute. You're a doctor?
181
Yeah, I'm a doctor.
182
Music and medicine, really. It's really been my thing.
183
It's combining the two and living in that place where they overlap.
184
A lot of people say it shows up in the music. I don't know. I mean, it's...
185
Well, okay. Yeah, I can see that.
186
Yeah, okay. I think the organization and the whole thing...
187
- The humanity, I guess. - Yeah.
188
- The humanity of the thing. The regard. - Yeah, the regard.
189
- I guess it's a big day for you, then. - It is. It was a medical morning.
190
- Everybody's all right? - Everybody's fine.
191
You've been here a while, I see.
192
I've been here. Drinking a little coffee.
193
- Yeah, I see. - I ordered you some.
194
You ordered for me?
195
I mean, is it cool? Is that cool?
196
Yeah, okay. Coffee, yeah.
197
- I could go for a coffee. - Okay, man.
198
Come on, have some coffee.
199
Okay, coffee it is.
200
Are those your cigarettes?
201
No, they were just sitting here when I got here.
202
- You don't smoke, do you? - No. I gave it up.
203
- Not for me, either. - Boy, enough of that.
204
That was enough, 25 big ones.
205
- Finished.
206
- Got the energy now.
207
Since I quit, I mean, just everything...
208
Yeah, you're focused.
209
- Zeroed in. Bang, you know? - Me, too.
210
I feel sorry for suckers still puffing away, you know?
211
- No willpower. - No willpower. Pacifier.
212
Silly. You know, the beauty of quitting is, now that I've quit...
213
I can have one. Because I've quit.
214
I mean, it's just like jewelry.
215
You know, it's not really... I don't even inhale.
216
You want to join me in one?
217
Yeah, since I quit. Okay.
218
- Now that you've quit, you can have one. - Sure, yeah.
219
I can do that. All right.
220
Boy, thank you.
221
Yeah, you know what I mean? Now that we've quit...
222
Cigarettes and coffee, man.
223
That's a combination.
224
Can't beat it.
225
We're really the coffee-and-cigarettes generation, when you think about it.
226
You know what I mean? In the '40s, it was the pie-and-coffee generation.
227
Like Abbott and Costello on TV, man. They always wanted pie and coffee.
228
Yeah, like Abbott and Costello. They were always ordering pie and coffee.
229
Have some coffee. Have some pie and coffee.
230
What are you waiting for?
231
You hang out here a lot?
232
This is my hangout.
233
I just wondered, 'cause I didn't see anything of yours on the jukebox.
234
If you don't like it here, we could go down to Taco Bell or something. Maybe that's more your style.
235
What are you saying, man? You're saying I'm a Taco Bell kind of guy?
236
No. I mean, if you don't like it here. - You said you don't like it here.
237
- No, I didn't say that.
238
We could go to the International House of Pancakes.
239
Maybe that's more up your alley. I don't know.
240
I didn't say that. I don't wanna go to the International House of Pancakes.
241
I'm comfortable.
242
Coffee is good, though, at IHOP.
243
You like the coffee down there at IHOP?
244
I drink the coffee at IHOP. I like the coffee. You don't like it?
245
Yeah, man. I like the IHOP coffee.
246
- Classy brew. - Yeah, that's good coffee.
247
Yeah, that's good coffee at the IHOP.
248
I almost forgot. Listen.
249
I worked with this drummer the other day in LA.
250
And this guy, man, his name is Giant Robo.
251
He was clanging and banging really hard. Man, I thought of you.
252
Maybe you want to... This is somebody, I think you ought to check him out.
253
You mean, you think I need a professional drummer? I'm not good enough?
254
What are you talking about?
255
No, but I'm just... You know, it's a musician.
256
I thought... I just wanted to tell you about this guy. It'd be great, man.
257
It's hard and industrial, and he's beating, and I just thought, "wow".
258
What are you trying to tell me? I need a drummer?
259
I could use a drummer?
260
The drumming on my records sucks? What are you saying?
261
Forget it, man.
262
You know what? - I think I really got to get going.
263
- You got to go?
264
Maybe another cup? Maybe another cigarette?
265
Boy, I'd like to. No. I really gotta go. I mean...
266
My wife, she's alone in a motel.
267
Maybe we could call her up, come on down here.
268
Have a cup of coffee and a couple of cigarettes.
269
She doesn't smoke. You know, it's the willpower.
270
- I see. - I don't want to start her.
271
No, you don't want to get her started.
272
- This is our little thing here. - Yeah, right.
273
But we can just sort of... We can just keep zipping along, you know.
274
I'll be thinking of you.
275
- Gotta go. - I guess so.
276
- See you soon. - Yeah, okay.
277
I wish you could stay a little longer.
278
- We were just starting to get going here. - Gotta go.
279
Okay, Jim.
280
- Next time. - Okay, next time.
281
- You take care. - You take care, too.
282
He's not on here, either.
283
- You're a fucking moron, you know that? - Now what?
284
I can't believe that you're still smoking those fucking things.
285
Vinny, they'll fuck you up. They'll kill you. Believe me.
286
Were you put on this fucking earth to annoy me?
287
You said you were gonna quit. Instead, you spend a fortune.
288
So those big tobacco companies can get fucking rich. And then you get cancer.
289
And then the fucking doctors and the hospitals, they can get rich.
290
And the undertakers, too.
291
All because you want to smoke like a fucking moron.
292
I can't help it. I'm fucking addicted, okay?
293
So, coffee and cigarettes?
294
That's your lunch? That ain't healthy, is it?
295
You're drinking coffee so don't break my fuckin' balls.
296
Vinny, I had lunch already.
297
So I'm on a diet, okay? Jesus!
298
Here comes my freaking kid.
299
Do me a favor. Don't tell your mother, please.
300
What the fuck am I talking about? She smokes like a locomotive, anyway.
301
How you doing, Junior?
302
- He don't talk much, does he? - Not lately.
303
Lately he's been the silent type.
304
I gave you $10 last night. So what did you do with it?
305
I just gave you $5.
306
Listen, I'll give you $1 more. That's it.
307
Can I at least get a hug? For $6, can I get a freaking hug?
308
$10 for a hug? You gotta be out of your freaking mind. All right, come here. I'll give you.
309
You better go get yourself something to eat, and something good.
310
Yeah, just like him. Get some coffee and cigarettes.
311
Oh, brother! What the fuck are you talking about?
312
Look how much coffee you're drinking.
313
You got the whole fucking pot over there with you.
314
So what? They always bring me a whole pot.
315
I like coffee. Keeps me going.
316
It keeps you going, all right. You're a fucking maniac. A caffeine maniac.
317
- You're drinking coffee, ain't you? - Yeah.
318
- So?
319
- So maybe you should try to quit.
320
- I ain't no fucking quitter. - I'll drink to that.
321
Fucking moron. Shit, here comes my kid again.
322
How much did you spend?
323
And that's all you got for $4? Peas and something to drink for $4?
324
- What the heck is in that bag? - It's those Chinese peas.
325
They're not?
326
They're Japanese?
327
Chinese, Japanese. Same thing.
328
Try one.
329
Jesus Christ! Tastes like black pepper.
330
Give me those.
331
Little bastard. Did you see that? He tried to fucking poison me.
332
No, he didn't, Joe. Listen to me. Those things are very expensive.
333
They're like a delicacy. A refined taste.
334
Refined taste, my ass.
335
Jesus Christ, not again.
336
I can't even light a fucking cigarette around here without getting busted.
337
You know something? You really are a fucking moron.
338
I'm gonna get to those big tobacco companies... and I'm gonna thank them when they put you in the fucking ground.
339
And did I ever tell that you're like a fucking wife that I don't need?
340
Can't fucking enjoy a cigarette.
341
Excuse me, miss. Can I get you some more coffee?
342
I really wish you hadn't done that.
343
I had it the right color, the right temperature. It was just right.
344
Sorry.
345
Hi.
346
Sorry. Sorry about the coffee.
347
- Does your name happen to be Gloria? - No.
348
'Cause I thought maybe you... You're not friends with...
349
Sorry.
350
So can I get you something else?
351
A sandwich? Something to eat along with your coffee?
352
It's not a very healthy lunch, just the coffee and cigarettes.
353
It's not my lunch, okay?
354
Sorry.
355
Alex.
356
You startled me.
357
How are you, Isaach?
358
Okay? Very well.
359
I'm happy to see you.
360
I was so sick of being in Paris. You can't imagine.
361
Sit down.
362
So, I was happy to get your call.
363
So long time we didn't see each other.
364
- I ordered you some coffee, okay? - Yeah, sure. Thanks.
365
So, everything is okay?
366
Everything is okay. Very good.
367
I am fine.
368
So, are you sure that everything is okay with you?
369
Everything is okay.
370
And you?
371
Me? Things are okay.
372
Not perfect, you know, but pretty much okay.
373
Good. I'm very happy to see you.
374
I'm happy to see you, man.
375
It's just that since I didn't see you for so long...
376
and you called to say you wanted to see me, I thought maybe something was wrong.
377
No. I just wanted to see you, that's all.
378
Me too, man. I wanted to see you too.
379
Are you sure there's nothing you want to tell me? - Nothing bothering you?
380
- But why?
381
- Do you want something to be wrong? - Not at all.
382
When I got your call, I had an intuition that something was bothering you.
383
Something maybe you need to talk about. That's all, man.
384
Isaach, there is nothing wrong. Really.
385
Okay?
386
Are you sure?
387
Are you crazy, Isaach?
388
Are you sure you have nothing...
389
you know, to let out?
390
Should I invent something bad? I could invent something bad for you.
391
Not at all. No. I don't want you to invent something.
392
You know, I'm your best friend.
393
You should feel completely free to tell me the truth.
394
To tell me whatever is bothering you.
395
Cut the shit.
396
Okay, I understand. That's cool.
397
Thank you.
398
No problem.
399
Isaach, no problem.
400
I guess I'm gonna go.
401
Really? So soon?
402
Yeah, you know, man... if you don't want to talk to me about it, I don't want to be a problem.
403
There is no problem, Isaach. Don't you understand? No problem.
404
I understand. But listen...
405
if you don't want to talk now, call me anytime, okay?
406
Now maybe it's not the right time for you, that's all.
407
So, I was very happy to see you.
408
Yes, me too.
409
I'm sorry to disappoint you, but there is nothing wrong. Really.
410
It's okay.
411
I do understand.
412
No. You don't understand.
413
Call me.
414
See you, Isaach.
415
Soon.
416
- Hi, so nice to see you. - You too.
417
It's been ages.
418
Last time, what? A couple of years ago in Sydney, wasn't it?
419
Really, was that two years ago?
420
How are Jeff and Beryl?
421
You know, same old, same old.
422
Still stuck in their odd little parental ways.
423
So you're not with Mr. Cate and the baby on this trip?
424
No. Unfortunately, I'm by myself. I'll see them next week.
425
Everyone's good? Yeah, I want a baby. At some point.
426
- What can I get for you? - What are you having, Catie?
427
Can I have an espresso, please? In a large cup?
428
Yeah, I'll have an espresso too, thanks. A double.
429
And can I have some hot milk on the side? And could you heat it?
430
- I think we can manage that. - Thank you.
431
I'm sorry I'm late. I know you haven't got a lot of time.
432
Don't worry about it. I just wish I could stay here longer.
433
Do you stay here overnight, or do you just do your press stuff here? Your junket.
434
No, I stay overnight and I do the interviews here too.
435
I just think it's easier. They do the interviews in my suite upstairs.
436
They're setting up for the next interview... and I just thought maybe it would be nicer if we met down here.
437
No, thanks, Shell. You're not...
438
Go on. They're not going to stop you smoking.
439
- There you go, cous'. - Thanks.
440
So you mean they give you this full-on hotel suite... and they also use it for your publicity?
441
Seems kind of cheap.
442
Well, it's a suite. So they just divide up the room.
443
Yeah, but why couldn't they get you a suite... and get another suite to do your press in?
444
It's pretty low-budget, this thing I did.
445
Yeah, still.
446
It's pretty cheap, man.
447
Can I get you anything else?
448
- No, thanks. That's great. - You're welcome.
449
Kind of weird getting in here. I almost didn't... until they found out I was your cousin.
450
There're some photographer, paparazzi guys hanging out front.
451
I guess they kind of follow you around, right?
452
You know, whatever so-called celebrities are around, I suppose.
453
God, that must be a real fucking drag sometimes, right?
454
I mean, not like me. I'm free.
455
Practically broke, but I'm completely free.
456
No one's stalking me, that's for fucking sure.
457
Except when they thought I was you.
458
I got into this club once because they thought I was you.
459
Then they found out I wasn't and asked me to leave.
460
Pretty fucking rude.
461
Don't get me wrong. I mean, it must be fabulous. You got it all.
462
You got a good husband, beautiful baby.
463
Travel all over the world, stay in fancy hotels.
464
Parties...
465
You know what they say, the grass is always greener.
466
So, how's...
467
Shit.
468
- Johnny. - Who?
469
Jimmy. Tommy. Sorry. How is he?
470
We broke up almost two years ago.
471
Tommy, yeah. What a dickhead.
472
Got a new boyfriend now. Lee. Remember?
473
He's in a band. Wrote you about him.
474
He's a pretty huge part of my life.
475
Sorry, Shell, I don't think you did.
476
Yeah, I even sent you his fucking CD.
477
Your assistant probably didn't give it to you.
478
It's okay. It's totally cool. I mean, I know how busy your life is.
479
- Do you remember where you sent it? - No. I mean, one week you're in LA...
480
then you're in London, then you're in Sydney.
481
I mean, you're in a different fucking city every day of the week.
482
I'd love to hear the music. What does it sound like?
483
It's really...
484
kind of hard...
485
and it's industrial, kind of throbbing...
486
I don't think you'd get it.
487
- What are they called? - They're called Sqürl.
488
Squirrel.
489
No, Sqürl. You know, like they say it here.
490
S-Q-U-R-L, with an umlaut over the "U". Sqürl.
491
Sqürl. I get it. Right.
492
So can I buy the CD until I find the one you sent?
493
No, not yet. They recorded it independently, you know, so...
494
But I think the record company's gonna put it out finally.
495
I think.
496
I'm gonna have to find that CD so I can listen to it.
497
You're not gonna find it.
498
Shell, that isn't fair, actually.
499
- It's true. You're not gonna find it. - Really?
500
I fucking know you're not. 'Cause I just remembered... I didn't actually send it to you.
501
I think I just thought about sending it to you.
502
Almost forgot. This is for you.
503
Thanks. What is it?
504
This is really expensive stuff. It must have cost hundreds.
505
Cool, thanks. I could use this stuff.
506
Make me look like a movie star, right?
507
- Cheers. - Cheers, gorgeous.
508
Seriously, Catie, thanks for seeing me.
509
No, thanks for seeing me.
510
And thanks for all the fancy swag.
511
It's nothing.
512
It is swag, isn't it?
513
They probably give you all kinds of free stuff... jewelry, clothes. Probably give you cars, right?
514
No, they don't give me cars. They sometimes give me makeup, from time to time. But I just thought... I don't know, I just wanted...
515
Didn't have time to go shopping.
516
No, really, it's fine. I mean, it's great. I can use it.
517
It's just funny, don't you think? When you can't afford something, it's really expensive.
518
And then when you can afford it, it's free.
519
Kind of backward, don't you think?
520
The world's a bit like that, I guess, in a lot of ways.
521
Speaking of paparazzi...
522
I saw these photos of you the other day in the tabloids.
523
Don't tell me that. Yuck.
524
What was I wearing?
525
Sorry.
526
Hello? Hi, Lindsey.
527
I'm downstairs, in the coffee room with my cousin Shelly.
528
It's already...
529
Okay, yeah. I'll be up in a minute. Bye.
530
- Got to get back to work? - Yeah.
531
Back to the grind?
532
Do you want to come up to the room?
533
It won't be very interesting, but you're welcome to come up.
534
What, and watch you do TV interviews and stuff?
535
Like Entertainment Tonight?
536
Maybe you can send me that CD, or a letter, or something.
537
- Yeah, but you wouldn't read it. - Stop it. I would if you actually sent it.
538
I've really gotta go. Sorry.
539
It was great seeing you. Have you got my numbers?
540
Take care. Send my love to everyone.
541
Yeah, send my love to everyone on your end.
542
If they even remember me.
543
- Bye, Catie. - See you, Shell.
544
Put that on my room and anything else she wants.
545
- Maybe next time I'll get to meet Lou. - Yeah.
546
It's Lee.
547
Excuse me.
548
Can I have a tequila? Thanks, a double, and the menu.
549
I'm sorry, there's no smoking in the lounge.
550
So, Jack, you going to tell me about your tesla coil?
551
You said you didn't want to hear about it.
552
Yeah, but that was a while ago.
553
I don't know if I want to talk about it.
554
Come on, Jack. You dragged it all the way down here in your little red wagon.
555
Come on, just tell me about it.
556
I built it based on the inventor Nikola Tesla's original designs.
557
It's an air transformer... with primary and secondary coils that are tuned to resonate.
558
It's basically a step-up transformer... which converts relatively low-voltage high current to high-voltage low current... at high frequencies.
559
Do you remember... when we were kids, you had a little Barbie makeup mirror?
560
Yeah, I remember that.
561
It had a little fluorescent light on it?
562
Nikola Tesla invented fluorescent light.
563
Without him, we wouldn't have alternating current... radio, television, x-ray technology... induction motors, particle beams, lasers.
564
None of that would even exist, if it weren't for him.
565
Or the rock band, Tesla.
566
Funny.
567
Tesla was a true genius.
568
If we had paid more attention to his ideas, the world would be a much better place. We'd have free mass communication, free transportation... free energy for everyone.
569
That's why they discredited him in the end. For free energy.
570
He perceived the Earth as a conductor of acoustical resonance.
571
What a beautiful idea.
572
So, Jack, are you going to show me how the coil works?
573
Yeah, all right.
574
You'll need these.
575
- All right, you ready, Meg? - I'm ready.
576
Damn it. Something went wrong.
577
It was cool, though.
578
Yeah, but it wasn't supposed to stop. It was supposed to keep working. I don't know what happened.
579
I think maybe you blew a capacitor?
580
No, I didn't blow a capacitor, Meg.
581
Maybe it tripped your GFI.
582
Yeah, your Ground Fault Interrupter.
583
Yeah, I know what a GFI is. That's not what happened.
584
You don't have to snap at me.
585
I think maybe the spark gaps are too far apart on your spark coil vibrator.
586
Yeah, that could be it.
587
I guess.
588
Yeah, it is. That's it.
589
You're right about that. I didn't check that earlier.
590
I'm gonna go home and check it out.
591
- Are you going to go bowling tomorrow? - Yeah, I'll be there.
592
All right, I'll see you there.
593
Earth as a conductor of acoustical resonance.
594
Hello, who is this?
595
Laura. Hi, this is Alfred Molina for Steve Coogan.
596
M-O-L-I-N-A.
597
The actor, yes.
598
I was just double-checking that Steve...
599
He is. Great, okay.
600
Just in case you need it, my cell phone number...
601
Hello? - Hello, Alfred. - Steve, hello.
602
Hi. I'm so glad you could make it. Please sit down.
603
I was just talking to Laura, your assistant, seeing if you were on your way here.
604
- I'm here. - Fantastic.
605
I took the liberty of ordering some tea.
606
Shall I be mother?
607
That's okay, I'll be my own mother.
608
Some milk there for you.
609
Real tea.
610
It's hard to come by.
611
I have this fantasy where if I ever won a Golden Globe or an Academy Award...
612
I'd use the opportunity to tell the Yanks how to make a decent cup of tea.
613
- Here's to a good cup of tea. - Cheers.
614
I love your coat.
615
Yeah, it's Viv Westwood.
616
I've got a weakness for British designers.
617
I don't know what it is about American designers.
618
They're just too safe.
619
Aren't you going to be a little bit warm? It's about 85 outside.
620
No, I take it off when I go out.
621
It's just the air conditioning.
622
- So how long have you been living in LA? - We've been here about seven years.
623
We love it here.
624
I do love visiting LA.
625
But I always say, it's a great place to visit, it's an even nicer place to leave.
626
The palm trees... Palm trees annoy the fuck out of me.
627
It's not for everybody. I like it here.
628
I came out here for the work and stuff.
629
It's great to finally meet you.
630
I've got to say I'm a huge fan of your stuff...
631
all the stuff you've done on TV, the comedy stuff.
632
I've got all the tapes. I get them sent over. It's fantastic.
633
Thank you.
634
Likewise, I'm certainly very aware of you.
635
Great.
636
I saw that TV series you did.
637
Yeah, you saw that?
638
Yeah. Interesting.
639
- We got canceled. - Yeah, I heard that.
640
Comedy's such a difficult thing.
641
Your career seems to be going terribly well. You've got a lot of heat at the moment.
642
Is that why you're here?
643
The merry-go-round of meetings. It's nice.
644
People are finally starting to take a bit of notice, which is great.
645
- Are you meeting on anything interesting? - Yeah.
646
I've got to say you were just fantastic... in 24 Hour. No, seriously,
647
- I mean, brilliant. Great work. - Thank you.
648
Really brilliant. It was...
649
And the reviews...
650
They were pretty fucking great.
651
I was amazed because it was... I didn't think many people would get all the cultural references.
652
Sort of, Manchester, early '80s, the whole music scene.
653
You'd be surprised.
654
But a lot of people didn't have any kind of reference to make to it because...
655
They know about the bands over here...
656
but the whole thing, your character, and his running the TV show...
657
Do you want a cigarette?
658
- Sorry, they're French. - No, that's okay. Thanks.
659
I'll save it for later.
660
Okay.
661
So, Laura said that... you were really keen to meeting. She wouldn't tell me what it was.
662
I didn't want to say it over the phone because it would've sounded weird.
663
I can imagine how she thought. This was coming out of nowhere.
664
I phone her up, and she doesn't know me from Adam. I said, "I must talk to Steve Coogan".
665
But I wanted to see you in person.
666
When I found out you'd be here for a few days...
667
I thought this was the perfect opportunity to let you know...
668
Anyway, I'll get right to it. I'm so excited about this.
669
Let me try and put it in context. I've always had a big passion for history... and people's lives... and all the little events of how you get from A to B...
670
and all the small details in people's lives... that are kind of really full of epic qualities.
671
So I've been doing all this research and...
672
I've come up with this.
673
And what state is... Is it greenlit or is it just a treatment? What stage is it?
674
I'm sorry. God, it's so embarrassing.
675
It's not some... This isn't work. It's got nothing to do with work. It's not a project.
676
I did some genealogical research, and I came across... What I discovered was...
677
- Mr. Coogan? - Yes?
678
- It is you, isn't it? - It is, yes.
679
- I'm such a huge fan. - You're not that huge. Only where it counts.
680
- Could I bother you for an autograph? - Absolutely. - Great.
681
- I've been recognized. Where do you want it?
682
- Paper is fine. - Spoilsport.
683
- No, don't do that. - Sorry.
684
- I probably have something in my bag. - Okay.
685
Just give me a second here.
686
Oh, gosh. - I'm so sorry. - That's all right.
687
- Give me one more minute. - Take your time.
688
- Here, please, in there. - Okay, and what's your name? Katy.
689
- With a "Y". - All right.
690
What Katy did next.
691
- Hello. - Alfred's an actor too.
692
- Here. - Thank you. Great.
693
- Thank you very much. - You're welcome.
694
- Wow. - Let's get back to this.
695
I don't want to take up too much of your time. I know you're busy.
696
As I said, I did this genealogical research...
697
I was just doing it for my own interest. I wasn't looking for anything specific. I just came across this.
698
I'll cut a long story short. Steve Coogan.
699
Drum roll.
700
The thing is, Steve...
701
you and I are cousins.
702
How do you mean? You mean artistically?
703
No, I mean in the normal way. We're cousins. We're related.
704
- It's amazing, isn't it? - Yeah. Are you sure?
705
The way it works out is this, look...
706
My great-great grandfather... is your great-great uncle.
707
And further back, we shared the same great-great-great grandfather.
708
My ancestry is Irish, but I knew there was an Italian...
709
That's it. The Italian connection is... the great-great-great-great grandfather, Giuseppe.
710
- Isn't that amazing? - Yeah, this is...
711
This is a lot of detail.
712
- It's my thing, I kind of do a little... - Amazing.
713
I think it's just great to be able to say that I'm related to Steve Coogan.
714
Likewise, I can tell people I'm related to Albert Molina.
715
Alfred.
716
It's my grandmother who's the big one on the family tree.
717
She'll be very thrilled. She's a huge fan of your work. She loved you in...
718
Boogie Nights.
719
Right, with the shorts and the shotgun?
720
Yeah, she talked about that once.
721
Great. I know this is coming right out of the blue, but just think of the possibilities.
722
It's fantastic. Let's look at the facts.
723
We're both actors. We're cousins, we've established that.
724
We could maybe work together, do a play maybe.
725
We could make a movie.
726
We could actually do a movie about this story.
727
About discovering this amazing thing between us, that we're cousins.
728
We can actually play ourselves.
729
We'd be in the movie. I'd be Fred Molina, you'd be Steve... We'd be cousins in the movie.
730
It's fantastic. It'd be great, absolutely great.
731
You know, or not. We could just hang out.
732
We should definitely go for a beer sometime. That'd be great.
733
Maybe go on vacation together, just the two of us... sort of get to know each other.
734
You're not gay are you?
735
No. No, I'm married.
736
So was James I.
737
Sorry. I don't know, that just popped into my head.
738
- Say it, get it out of the way. - I understand.
739
I know exactly what you're thinking.
740
If somebody came up to me going, I'm your cousin...
741
I'd think they were a nutter as well.
742
Take it from me, I'm not crazy. I just think this is a fantastic, extraordinary...
743
- Delightful thing for me. - Absolutely.
744
- And I just wanted you to know about it. - Ditto.
745
All I want, if I want anything... is for you to just acknowledge this extraordinary thing... and just love me.
746
Yeah, I could do that.
747
I have to go.
748
I didn't tell you. I have this meeting. - It actually moved forward. - I see.
749
It's at Universal. Number crunchers, financiers...
750
- This... - That's for you. - That's great. - It's yours.
751
- I'll make sure that gets filed. - Sure.
752
You'll be here a couple of days, right?
753
So maybe we could see each other before you go.
754
Just checking the mental diary...
755
This is not good, the time I'm here.
756
- It's just that it's packed. - I understand. No problem.
757
Give me your cell phone number, and I'll call you before you go.
758
There's a story there.
759
There's a tri-band system here in the States... which is different to the system in the UK... and it's a kind of...
760
The cell phones, they don't work here. So I'm kind of cell phone-less... - in the US. - I see. Well, give me your home number. I'll call you.
761
- You've got my PA's number, right? - Yeah.
762
Great, then we're connected.
763
Can't you give me your number at home?
764
Can I say no? Because nothing, absolutely nothing personal...
765
It's just that I never give my number out, ever.
766
It's just a personal space thing.
767
It's just a rule and I always think, stick to the rule.
768
It's more of a philosophy than a rule.
769
I've not given my number out to many eminent people in the past.
770
I once didn't give my number to Sam Mendes. So you're in good company.
771
If it's good enough for Sam Mendes, it's good enough for me.
772
- I think it's me. - Right, because mine doesn't work.
773
I'm sorry, I got to take this. I'll get back.
774
Hello?
775
Yeah, sure.
776
Spike, hi. How you doing?
777
You got the message.
778
My agent just called you just to make sure we're all on the same page.
779
No, the producer credit is just so you and I can sort of keep tabs on everything. You know, artistic integrity, that sort of thing.
780
Otherwise the whole thing could just run away.
781
You bastard, no.
782
All right.
783
You still okay for Sunday? Good. All right.
784
Will I meet you there? All right. Nice and early. Okay, yeah. Lots of love. Bye, Spike.
785
- I'm sorry about that. - It's okay, fine.
786
Was that Spike Lee?
787
No. I don't even know Spike Lee. That was Spike Jonze.
788
- I love him. - Yeah, he's a good man.
789
We've been friends for a long time now.
790
We're both keen hikers. - Well, it's very boring. - No, go on.
791
We belong to a club, and we go hiking at weekends.
792
He's a very committed environmentalist.
793
Spike Jonze is a tree-hugger. Jesus, I never had him down as that.
794
I think he prefers the term "leaf people"... as do I.
795
Right, I mean, that's... Don't get me wrong. That's great. I love trees.
796
I think there should be more of them. When I use paper, I use both sides.
797
I would love to... You know, I'm going to tear up... that stupid rule about phone numbers. It's such shit.
798
Would it be shabby of me to give you my number now?
799
Yeah.
800
I've got to go. I'm so sorry.
801
- I'll get the check. - Good.
802
Fuck.
803
Damn RZA. Where the fuck you at?
804
- Yo, peace. - Bobby.
805
- Pardon me for being late. - Ain't nothing. - I was about to hit you on the horn. - I had a fucking emergency house call, yo.
806
- A house call? - Yeah, a house call.
807
Sophia and Sifu's children got sick with the flu and the virus.
808
So I went by, prescribed some herbal medicines for them.
809
I told them, lay off the dairy products, chill on the citric acid... and they should feel a little better.
810
- So you a doctor now, or something? - Yeah, I told you.
811
I've been studying alternative medicine for two years now, son.
812
I mean, ancient healing techniques, and all that.
813
Check this. I even know a certain surgical procedure that I can perform using a drill-gun.
814
Electric drill-gun. I'm dead serious.
815
But my hands are nice from being a DJ, you know what I mean?
816
To me, music and medicine, all go together.
817
It's like two planets revolving around the same sun.
818
So bong-bong. - Want some tea? - Yeah, splash me.
819
It's all herbals, man. No caffeine.
820
That's what I'm talking about. No caffeine. Caffeine is ridiculous right now, man.
821
Tell me about it. Caffeine leads to depression... makes you all irritable, have your heart beating fast.
822
Faster heart rate, you know what I mean?
823
And worse than anything, you drink that coffee, it gives you the shits.
824
You know what I mean? So I try to stay away from that.
825
- I'm off that shit, anyway. - Crisp and clean. No caffeine.
826
- To Liquid Swords, family. - No, to Bobby Digital.
827
- Wu-Tang forever. - Wu-Tang forever.
828
Anybody need more coffee?
829
- Kitchen's closing. - No, we don't mess with caffeine.
830
- You don't? - No, I don't.
831
Don't you know caffeine can cause serious delirium?
832
- Delirium? - Serious delirium.
833
Now you tell me. Well, that may be my problem, delirium.
834
Aren't you Bill Murray, man? - You're Bill Murray? - Yeah, I'm Bill Murray... but let's keep that just between us, all right? Just between us.
835
And you guys are related?
836
Yeah, we're cousins. We're family.
837
No, you're messing with me because you're both troublemakers.
838
- Troublemakers? - The Wu-Tang Clan.
839
Right, Wu-Tang Clan.
840
- You're GZA, the genius. - That's right.
841
- And you're RZA... - A.k.a...
842
- Bobby Digital. - Yeah, he knows hip-hop.
843
And you're Bill Murray.
844
Bill "Groundhog-Day-Ghostbusting-Ass" Murray.
845
- Who ya gonna call? - I know that. Just don't tell anybody.
846
What you mean, don't tell anybody, Bill Murray?
847
People will come here, they'll see you. You're Bill Murray. It's obvious.
848
Unless you're wearing a disguise or something.
849
I am wearing kind of a disguise.
850
Damn, that's harsh, money.
851
- You're a real caffeine junkie, aren't you? - Keep it down. Just between us. Here, cheers.
852
You know, before I gave that up... I used to drink it every single night... up until it was time to go to sleep. Used to make me dream faster.
853
You know, like when they flash those cameras on those Indy 500 cars... and they just...
854
That's how my dreams were. Just whizzing by.
855
- You're stupid, yo. - He is stupid, isn't he? Word, yo.
856
I know a guy who freezes coffee. Puts sticks in it, has himself a coffee Popsicle. A caf pop.
857
Damn. That don't sound too good, Bill Murray.
858
It's not the flu or anything. It's just a smoker's cough.
859
That's what I'm saying, nicotine interferes with your central nervous system... your respiratorial system.
860
In very small doses, it causes paralysis.
861
- Really? - Yeah, really, man.
862
I mean, just 50mg alone... have been proven to be fatal in a few minutes.
863
- How much is in one cigarette? - 3mg.
864
And did you know they also use nicotine for insecticide... - to kill bugs? - It's good if it kills bugs, right?
865
Are you a bug, Bill Murray?
866
- Jesus, RZA, you sound like my doctor. - He is a doctor.
867
Actually, he specializes in alternative medicine.
868
That is, alternative to this planet.
869
Do me a favor and don't tell anybody you saw me here, okay?
870
You can trust us, Bill Murray. - You hiding out or something? - Yeah, sort of, something like that.
871
Now I'm thinking it may be delirium.
872
- Serious delirium. - Serious.
873
If you're on the low, I got something that'll help you with your disguise.
874
Take this.
875
- Use whatever you want. - Jeez.
876
- Rock that, man. Stay on the low. - You didn't have to do this. This is great.
877
A bag of items for you, Bill.
878
- Thank you. - Don't worry about it.
879
I really appreciate this.
880
This is great.
881
Doc, what could I do for this cough?
882
I was just thinking about that. Check this out.
883
- You get some hydrogen peroxide. - We got that for cuts and stuff.
884
Take 50% hydrogen peroxide, 50% water.
885
You gargle with it. Do not swallow, you spit it out.
886
Don't swallow, Bill Murray.
887
And if that doesn't work, try oven cleaner.
888
I got that in the back, too.
889
- Thank you. - Cool.
890
Thank you. I'm going to try it right now.
891
- Word. - Word, man.
892
- Bill motherfucking Murray. - It's crazy, yo.
893
- 3:00. - What's up?
894
I told Ghost to be here by 3:00 a.m.
895
Don't hold your breath on that. You know how it is waiting on Ghost.
896
- We'll be here all night. - Think we can smoke a blunt up here?
897
- It's hot up in here with the 5-0. - But we used to always smoke weed in here.
898
That was until Dirt Dog done blew it up.
899
Told Deflon, "Never let Dirty inside this spot, man".
900
So what's up? What you want to do?
901
- Yo, let's slide to the 'udio. - Hit the 'udio, right. Play some chess? All right, then.
902
- Is that the bill for Murray? - He don't need no money, yo.
903
- Hit him, anyway. - Think I should tip him?
904
- You think he's using the oven cleaner? - Don't know, but let's get the fuck out.
905
Are you all right, Taylor?
906
- No, not really. - What's up?
907
I don't know. I feel so divorced from the world.
908
I've lost touch with the world.
909
Do you know that song by Mahler...
910
- I've Lost Track of the World? - No.
911
It's one of the most beautiful... and saddest songs ever written.
912
I can almost hear it now.
913
Can you hear it?
914
It's gone now.
915
- But did you hear it? - I think so.
916
It resonated right through the whole building.
917
- Where are we? - In the armory, Taylor. The armory, Taylor.
918
It sounds so heavy and ponderous.
919
The armory.
920
Nikola Tesla...
921
perceived the Earth as a conductor... of acoustical resonance.
922
I have no idea what you're talking about.
923
Can you explain it to me?
924
- No, not really. - I know. Let's pretend this coffee is champagne.
925
Why would we do that?
926
Well, to celebrate life.
927
You know, like the rich, elegant people do.
928
The classy people.
929
I prefer coffee. Simple, working man's coffee.
930
You're so provincial, Bill. Do you know what your problem is?
931
What?
932
You have no joie de vivre.
933
I don't?
934
No, besides, this coffee is awful.
935
- You're right. It really is bad, isn't it? - Dreadful.
936
I propose a toast.
937
So what should we toast?
938
Paris in the 1920s.
939
Josephine Baker, the Moulin Rouge.
940
What is it? Okay? And also...
941
New York in the '70s. In the late '70s.
942
Really? All right.
943
Cheers.
944
Delicious, isn't it?
945
Champagne, nectar of the gods.
946
Is that all you're having for lunch, coffee and a cigarette?
947
It's not very healthy.
948
We had lunch earlier. We did?
949
We're on a break here, a coffee break.
950
How depressing.
951
How long is our break, anyway?
952
About 10 minutes, and it's nearly over now.
953
Say it isn't true.
954
- Well? - What?
955
I asked you to say it isn't true.
956
Say what isn't true?
957
Never mind.
958
Anyway, I have to have a nap.
959
So call me when the break is over.
960
Well, you have two minutes or less for your nap.
961
