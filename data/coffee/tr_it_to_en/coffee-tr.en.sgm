<seg id="16"> I enjoy drinking it before going to sleep. </seg>
<seg id="17"> I'll get a lot of it before. Accelerate your dreams. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Like in Indianopolis, with cameras on racing cars ... Everything runs fast, like dreams. </seg>
<seg id="19"> One dream after another, after another, after another. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The next day they ask me what I dreamed of. </seg>
<seg id="21"> I say, it would take so long. And I do not. </seg>
<seg id="22"> - Do you smoke? - Only when I drink ... coffee. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Do you know my mother? </seg>

<seg id="40"> No, from here. </seg>
<seg id="41"> From here, oh ... I have to go away shortly. I have appointment from the dentist. </seg>
<seg id="42"> But I do not want to go. I do not like dentists. </seg>
<seg id="43"> - But I have to go, unfortunately. </seg>
<seg id="44"> - Yeah. - It's a piece that I'm not leaving. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Bravo, do not you go? </seg>
<seg id="46"> - I should, but I do not want it. - Well? </seg>
<seg id="47"> Steve, I'm free. Perfectly free. </seg>

<seg id="54"> - The boy's name. - Yes, 4:30. </seg>
<seg id="55"> - Steven, thank you very much. - No problem. </seg>
<seg id="56"> - Do not you dry it? - No </seg>
<seg id="57"> An appointment from the dentist, what a beauty. </seg>
<seg id="58"> I have to go. Excuse me, Steve. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Steve, yes, I have to go to the dentist. - I'm late. </seg>
<seg id="60"> - Thanks, and sorry, I'm sorry. - But figured, do not be late. </seg>
<seg id="61"> - It was a pleasure. - For me, in a way. </seg>
<seg id="62"> What do we do in Memphis? </seg>
<seg id="63"> - It was your idea to come. - No, yours. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Is my idea? It was yours. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Very funny. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Do not smoke those cigarette cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="67"> I hate you. </seg>
<seg id="68"> - So what? - What are you, a cawboy? </seg>
<seg id="69"> - I'm fine. Pure Tobacco. - No, this is pure stuff. </seg>
<seg id="70"> - This is the stupid pleasure of the cigarette. - It's overworked, are you crazy? </seg>
<seg id="71"> - I am not. - But shut up. </seg>
<seg id="72"> What do we do here? Full? </seg>
<seg id="73"> - Even. </seg>
<seg id="74"> - You are welcome? - Oh yes. </seg>
<seg id="75"> - Hey! - Shit! Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="76"> - Are you stupid, what are you doing? - Fuck, I'm sorry. </seg>
<seg id="77"> I would not even pay the bill. This place is terrible. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Do not you take anything else? Only... </seg>
<seg id="79"> - Let me sign in. - Only coffee and cigarettes? </seg>
<seg id="80"> It's not very healthy, you know? </seg>
<seg id="81"> - Do you bring some sandwich, something? - No. </seg>
<seg id="82"> Are you part of these? - No. </seg>
<seg id="83"> Are you brother and sister? </seg>
<seg id="84"> - Even. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Are twins? </seg>
<seg id="86"> - Even. </seg>
<seg id="87"> We are. </seg>
<seg id="88"> I imagined. Do you know who you remember? </seg>
<seg id="89"> - Who? - Heckel and Jeckel. </seg>
<seg id="90"> And what a fuck. </seg>
<seg id="91"> Do you know ... the talking girls? </seg>
<seg id="92"> However, who is the bad twin? It works like this, right? </seg>
<seg id="93"> - This cafe knows mushrooms. - It's true. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Which of the two has the bad air, according to you? </seg>
<seg id="95"> I think so, what do you say? He has bad eyes. </seg>
<seg id="96"> - I'm kidding. - It will be better for you. </seg>
<seg id="97"> You know, I thought of something, since you're twins. </seg>
<seg id="98"> - Have you been to Graceland? - No. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Oh, you should. Is strong. </seg>
<seg id="100"> - Is it a problem if I sit down? - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="101"> All right, sit down. Are you paused? </seg>
<seg id="102"> Not really, but the bar is empty. Do me a favor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> Do not move, cover it so your boss does not see me. </seg>
<seg id="104"> Is it bad or not? </seg>
<seg id="105"> I was thinking of one thing. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Did you know that Elvis Presley had a twin? </seg>
<seg id="107"> Yes, it's called Jesse Garon. Elvis's second name was Aron. </seg>
<seg id="108"> Aron, Garon. Anyway, did not everyone think he was dead? </seg>
<seg id="109"> For me... </seg>
<seg id="110"> the mother, expecting a son only, did not want to pull it on two. </seg>
<seg id="111"> He could not afford it, </seg>
<seg id="112"> So one gave it away. </seg>
<seg id="113"> So this Jesse grew up in Arkansas or Mississippi. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Without knowing having a brother. Until one day, in '68 or '69 ... </seg>
<seg id="115"> ... while looking into the mirror, he said, "Caspita, I'm identical to Elvis." </seg>
<seg id="116"> He went to Memphis. </seg>
<seg id="117"> Elvis sees it and says, "You are my brother, I can not believe it!" </seg>
<seg id="118"> "What can I do for you?" </seg>
<seg id="119"> And his brother replied, "I do not know." </seg>
<seg id="120"> "It would be great to be you for a night." </seg>
<seg id="121"> Elvis had a concert, but singing sends us his brother. </seg>
<seg id="122"> He wanted to see if people dropped us. And for misery, even hearing them was the same. </seg>
<seg id="123"> Then Elvis came up with an idea. </seg>
<seg id="124"> "I'm tired of being on tour, I'm sending him." </seg>
<seg id="125"> Big mistake! His brother started to go to Las Vegas ... </seg>
<seg id="126"> ... to wear collars, white suits and cloaks, you know? </seg>
<seg id="127"> Elvis would never do it. And it was his brother what grew fat. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Filling up with fried and fried breads. </seg>
<seg id="129"> And the Colonel said, "Take it off her feet, she can not do Elvis anymore" </seg>
<seg id="130"> And they began to blush it with pills. They say they made it out. </seg>
<seg id="131"> Then? Conclusion? How does history end? </seg>
<seg id="132"> - Are you fan of Elvis? - No. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Want to hear something about Elvis? I'll tell you, okay? </seg>
<seg id="134"> Have you ever heard of Otis Blackwell? - No </seg>
<seg id="135"> - Of Junior Parker? - No </seg>
<seg id="136"> I was sure. Elvis stole their music. </seg>
<seg id="137"> He gave them $ 10 each, to them and to all the other black musicians. </seg>
<seg id="138"> - Here's what I think of Elvis. - And it all marries my theory. </seg>
<seg id="139"> For me it was not Elvis, he was his brother. </seg>
<seg id="140"> If so, we're in place, right? </seg>
<seg id="141"> His phrase I prefer is, "The only thing a nigger can do is to lick my shoes." </seg>
<seg id="142"> The King can not have said it. I think he was his bad twin. </seg>
<seg id="143"> Danny, what are you doing down there? You have to serve the tables, walk. </seg>
<seg id="144"> - I'll be right back. - Do not throw yourself out, buddy. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Danny! Poof buzzurro. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Cin Cin, health. </seg>
<seg id="147"> I feel a strange odor. </seg>
<seg id="148"> Hey! Did you put my shirt on? </seg>
<seg id="149"> No I do not think so. </seg>
<seg id="150"> I think so, instead. It smells like me. </seg>
<seg id="151"> You know what you know? </seg>
<seg id="152"> I know about myself, and this one knows about you. </seg>
<seg id="153"> - I also know about myself. - But this one knows about you. </seg>
<seg id="154"> Because I am me. </seg>
<seg id="155"> Is that my shirt? </seg>
<seg id="156"> - Why do you always copy me? - I will not copy you. </seg>
<seg id="157"> - Why do not you have your own style? - Of course I got it. </seg>
<seg id="158"> No, you always copy me. Your style is mine, because it cops me. </seg>
<seg id="159"> - It's my style. - No, it is not. </seg>
<seg id="160"> The service sucks, coffee also, music makes vomiting. </seg>
<seg id="161"> Hey. Those are my shoes! </seg>
<seg id="162"> - They are mine. - They are mine. </seg>
<seg id="163"> - Those are mine. - They are the others. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Bullshit. </seg>
<seg id="165"> - Hey. - Hey Tom. </seg>
<seg id="166"> - Good. - Well, I'm glad you did it. </seg>
<seg id="167"> - Here you are. </seg>
<seg id="168"> Call me Jim. </seg>
<seg id="169"> That is, friends call me Jim. Or Jimmy, or Iggy. </seg>
<seg id="170"> Call me J ... no, call me Iggy, Iggy. </seg>
<seg id="171"> Okay, for me it's indifferent. Jim or Iggy </seg>
<seg id="172"> Iggy. Call me Iggy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> I'm sorry to be late, Jim. Four cars one on the other. </seg>
<seg id="174"> It was a birth, this morning at nine o'clock. </seg>
<seg id="175"> I saved several lives, I was on the highway, it was ... </seg>
<seg id="176"> There is nothing worse than improvising an operation. </seg>
<seg id="177"> You know, without the right irons we become butcheries. </seg>
<seg id="178"> I did a trachon with a bureau ... </seg>
<seg id="179"> I was very busy. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Wait a second, are you a doctor? </seg>
<seg id="181"> Yes, I'm a doctor. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Music and medicine are my two great passions. </seg>
<seg id="183"> ... And at the point where they overlap, there is me. </seg>
<seg id="184"> A lot of people say they feel a lot in my music, I do not know ... </seg>
<seg id="185"> - Well, yes, I know ... - Really? </seg>
<seg id="186"> - Yeah, I can see it. - Yup? </seg>
<seg id="187"> Wow !. Sent .. It's the organization, the whole. Humanity, I think. </seg>
<seg id="188"> The humanity that is inside, of course. The feeling </seg>
<seg id="189"> So you've had a beautiful full day. Yes, one morning by a doctor </seg>
<seg id="190"> - Everybody safe? - All in shape. </seg>
<seg id="191"> - Well ... - Are you here for a long time, or am I wrong? </seg>
<seg id="192"> Yes a bit'. I drank a coffee </seg>
<seg id="193"> - I see. - I also ordered it for you. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Me too? </seg>
<seg id="195"> In short, all right. It's right? </seg>
<seg id="196"> Sure, of course, okay ... coffee </seg>
<seg id="197"> - Go for coffee. - Okay. </seg>
<seg id="198"> Strength, take some coffee. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Coffee is served. </seg>
<seg id="200"> Are your cigarettes? </seg>
<seg id="201"> They were already there when I arrived. </seg>
<seg id="202"> - You do not smoke, do not you? - Yeah. I quit. </seg>
<seg id="203"> - Me too. Madonna. - Closed. </seg>
<seg id="204"> All right, finally. After 25 years! </seg>
<seg id="205"> End. </seg>
<seg id="206"> - I did the load of energy. </seg>
<seg id="207"> - I feel great. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Since I stopped, I mean ... it's all. Refurbished. </seg>
<seg id="209"> - Centrally, bang! You know? - Me too. </seg>
<seg id="210"> I'm feeling a lot of pain for the other idiots who still smoke, you know? </seg>
<seg id="211"> - They have no willpower. - It's their soothing. </seg>
<seg id="212"> The good thing is that when it stops, it's that having stopped ... </seg>
<seg id="213"> ... I can smoke it, so I stopped. </seg>
<seg id="214"> You know, it's all an ornamental thing ... </seg>
<seg id="215"> It's not true. I did not aspire either. </seg>
<seg id="216"> Do you want to make me company? </seg>
<seg id="217"> - But yes, so I stopped ... - Well, </seg>
<seg id="218"> - Okay. Okay. - Since you've stopped. - You can smoke it. - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="219"> Of course I can, yes. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Hey, thank you! </seg>
<seg id="221"> Did you understand what I mean? Now that I've stopped ... </seg>
<seg id="222"> Damn it, coffee and cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="223"> Perfect Couple. </seg>
<seg id="224"> Unbeatable. </seg>
<seg id="225"> We are the generation of "coffee and cigarettes" if you think so well. </seg>
<seg id="226"> That of the 40s was "cake and coffee". </seg>
<seg id="227"> Like Gianni and Pinotto. They always ordered cake and coffee. </seg>
<seg id="228"> Yes, yes, like Gianni and Pinotto! They always ordered cake and coffee. </seg>
<seg id="229"> A coffee! A piece of cake and a coffee! </seg>
<seg id="230"> What are you waiting for? </seg>
<seg id="231"> come here often? </seg>
<seg id="232"> Yes, it is the place I frequent most of all. </seg>
<seg id="233"> I was wondering why there are no disks in the jukebox. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Well, if you do not like it ... we can go to Mexican fast-food. Maybe it's your kind. </seg>
<seg id="235"> What would you like, excuse me? You're saying, What are the fast-food type? </seg>
<seg id="236"> No. I said, if you do not like it ... You said you did not like it. </seg>
<seg id="237"> No, no. I did not say this. </seg>
<seg id="238"> We can go to that bar on the corner. </seg>
<seg id="239"> Maybe it's more than your own, I would not know. </seg>
<seg id="240"> But who said it? I do not want to go to the bar at the corner. </seg>
<seg id="241"> I'm fine here. </seg>
<seg id="242"> Coffee is good at that bar. </seg>
<seg id="243"> Do you like their coffee? </seg>
<seg id="244"> I drink it, I like it, do not you like it? </seg>
<seg id="245"> Of course yes. I like their coffee. </seg>
<seg id="246"> - It's fine stuff, great class. - Yes, it's good. </seg>
<seg id="247"> It's good coffee in that bar. </seg>
<seg id="248"> Wow, I was almost forgetting. Listen. </seg>
<seg id="249"> The other day I played with a drummer in Los Angeles. </seg>
<seg id="250"> It's called Giant Robo. </seg>
<seg id="251"> You do not know how strong it is, I thought of you. </seg>
<seg id="252"> Maybe you could ... I think you should hear it! Yes eh? </seg>
<seg id="253"> Why ... do you think I need a professional drummer? Am I not good enough? </seg>
<seg id="254"> Are you saying this? </seg>
<seg id="255"> No. No. I was just ... you know. I wanted to talk to you. </seg>
<seg id="256"> I just wanted to talk to you, because it's a real phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="257"> It's hard, metallic, it's strong. And so I thought, '' ah, though. '' </seg>
<seg id="258"> Are you trying to tell me that I need a drummer? </seg>
<seg id="259"> What do I need? </seg>
<seg id="260"> That the percussion of my record is sucking? What are you trying to say? </seg>
<seg id="261"> Oh, forget it. Leave it alone. </seg>
<seg id="262"> You know what? I think I have to go. </seg>
<seg id="263"> You have to go? </seg>
<seg id="264"> Maybe another coffee? Another sig ... </seg>
<seg id="265"> I would like. But no, I have to go. I really have to go. </seg>
<seg id="266"> My wife, alone in a motel. </seg>
<seg id="267"> - I understand ... - Yes, you know ... </seg>
<seg id="268"> Call her and tell her to come here. He drinks a coffee, smokes a couple of cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="269"> - Do not smoke. - It's the willpower. </seg>
<seg id="270"> - I got it. - I do not want you to start ... </seg>
<seg id="271"> - No ... I do not want it to start. </seg>
<seg id="272"> This is something among us. Right, yes ... </seg>
<seg id="273"> Well, let's ... every now and then we keep crossing. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I'll think about it, I'll think about you. </seg>
<seg id="275"> Now I have to go. Eh, I know so ... </seg>
<seg id="276"> See you soon. Yup. </seg>
<seg id="277"> I was hoping you could stop more. </seg>
<seg id="278"> - Damn, me, I ... Now that we were starting to warm up. - I have to go. </seg>
<seg id="279"> - Okay Jim. </seg>
<seg id="280"> - Next. - Yes, next time. </seg>
<seg id="281"> - Be a good boy. - You too. </seg>
<seg id="282"> There are not even his disks. </seg>
<seg id="283"> - You're a fucking whore, do you know that? - What is it now? </seg>
<seg id="284"> I can not believe you keep smoking that shit! It's incredible. </seg>
<seg id="285"> Vinny, they'll shoot you. They will kill you. Believe me. </seg>
<seg id="286"> Did you come to the world to break? </seg>
<seg id="287"> You said you stopped, but keep on spending a fortune. </seg>
<seg id="288"> And the fucking multinationals are enriched! And then you will be cancer. </seg>
<seg id="289"> So those doctors and dudes will also be enriched. </seg>
<seg id="290"> And even the seagulls! </seg>
<seg id="291"> All because you keep smoking, fucking shit. </seg>
<seg id="292"> I can not do anything about it. I'm fucking dependent, okay? </seg>
<seg id="293"> So go to coffee and cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="294"> Is that how you dine? Does not do very well, you know? </seg>
<seg id="295"> You also drink coffee, so do not break the whips! </seg>
<seg id="296"> Vinny, I've already had lunch. </seg>
<seg id="297"> I'm on diet, okay? What balls. </seg>
<seg id="298"> Here's my son's delinquent. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Give me a favor, do not tell your mother. </seg>
<seg id="300"> But what the fuck am I saying? That smokes like a steam locomotive. </seg>
<seg id="301"> How is he going? </seg>
<seg id="302"> It's not a chatter, is not it? </seg>
<seg id="303"> Lately not. It's silent </seg>
<seg id="304"> I gave you $ 10 last night, what did you do to him? </seg>
<seg id="305"> I've just given you 5. </seg>
<seg id="306"> Look, you'll still have one. Closed. </seg>
<seg id="307"> Do not you hug me? For $ 6 I do not even win a hug? </seg>
<seg id="308"> You must be fucking your brain! All right, come on, you do ... </seg>
<seg id="309"> But bought something to eat, something healthy. </seg>
<seg id="310"> Yes, like your father. Coffee and cigarettes! </seg>
<seg id="311"> Oh, but what the fuck are you saying? </seg>
<seg id="312"> Look how much fucking coffee you drink! </seg>
<seg id="313"> You got to get a fucking cock full. </seg>
<seg id="314"> And with this? They always give me a whole pot. </seg>
<seg id="315"> I like coffee. I charge her. </seg>
<seg id="316"> You charge her! You're a fucking sick! Caffeine. </seg>
<seg id="317"> Caffeine Sick. Why do not you drink coffee? </seg>
<seg id="318"> - Yes and then? </seg>
<seg id="319"> Then maybe you should try to give up. </seg>
<seg id="320"> I'm not a kid of renunciation. Fuckin 'fuckin'. </seg>
<seg id="321"> What balls, my son again. </seg>
<seg id="322"> How much did you spend? </seg>
<seg id="323"> For dried peas and a drink? </seg>
<seg id="324"> - What's in the bag? - Chinese peas. </seg>
<seg id="325"> No? </seg>
<seg id="326"> Japanese? </seg>
<seg id="327"> Chinese, Japanese ... always the same thing. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Assaggy one. </seg>
<seg id="329"> My god knows black pepper! </seg>
<seg id="330"> Give it a little ... </seg>
<seg id="331"> Small bastard! Did you see? He wanted to poison me! </seg>
<seg id="332"> But no, Joe. Listen to me. Those are so dear to me. </seg>
<seg id="333"> They are delicious, they have a special taste. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Taste a dick. </seg>
<seg id="335"> Oh God, still? </seg>
<seg id="336"> How do I light a cigarette to torment me, fuck! </seg>
<seg id="337"> Do you know what? You're really a fucking whore. </seg>
<seg id="338"> I'll thank the great multinationals of tobacco ... ... when they'll bury you. </seg>
<seg id="339"> Did I ever tell you you're worse than a fucking wife? </seg>
<seg id="340"> You can not even smoke a cigarette in holy peace. </seg>
<seg id="341"> Sorry Miss. Umm ... Can I have more coffee? </seg>
<seg id="342"> Ahh, if he did not do it was better. </seg>
<seg id="343"> It had the right color, the temperature. It was perfect </seg>
<seg id="344"> Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Hello. </seg>
<seg id="346"> Excuse me, excuse me for coffee. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Sorry. Is it called Gloria? No. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Why did I think maybe ... It's probably not the friend of ... </seg>
<seg id="349"> Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="350"> Can I bring you something else? </seg>
<seg id="351"> A sandwich, something to eat ... ... along with coffee? </seg>
<seg id="352"> Coffee and cigarettes is not a very healthy lunch. </seg>
<seg id="353"> It's not my lunch, okay? </seg>
<seg id="354"> Excuse me. </seg>
<seg id="355"> Alex. </seg>
<seg id="356"> You scared me. </seg>
<seg id="357"> How's it going, Isaach? </seg>
<seg id="358"> All right? Very well. </seg>
<seg id="359"> I'm happy to see you. </seg>
<seg id="360"> I was so tired of staying in Paris. You can not imagine. </seg>
<seg id="361"> Sit down. </seg>
<seg id="362"> I'm glad you called me. </seg>
<seg id="363"> It's a lot we do not see. No? </seg>
<seg id="364"> I'll take you a coffee. All right? Of course, thank you. </seg>
<seg id="365"> So is everything okay? </seg>
<seg id="366"> Yes. It's all right, really fine. </seg>
<seg id="367"> I'm fine. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Are you sure everything is okay? </seg>
<seg id="369"> Yes. It's all right. </seg>
<seg id="370"> And how are you? </seg>
<seg id="371"> I? All right. </seg>
<seg id="372"> Not at all, but pretty well. </seg>
<seg id="373"> I'm delighted to see you. </seg>
<seg id="374"> Me too. </seg>
<seg id="375"> Since it was quite a while we did not see it ... </seg>
<seg id="376"> ... and you called me out of nowhere by saying "let's see". I thought you got hurt in some trouble. </seg>
<seg id="377"> No. I just wanted to see you, all here. </seg>
<seg id="378"> Me too. I wanted to see you too. </seg>
<seg id="379"> Are you sure there is nothing that is worrying about you? </seg>
<seg id="380"> And why, </seg>
<seg id="381"> Must there be something for something? Of course not. </seg>
<seg id="382"> But when you called me, I thought there was something. </seg>
<seg id="383"> Something that maybe ... you need to tell me. Here, all here. </seg>
<seg id="384"> Isaach. Everything is alright. Really </seg>
<seg id="385"> Okay? </seg>
<seg id="386"> Are you sure? </seg>
<seg id="387"> Are you crazy, Isaach? </seg>
<seg id="388"> Sure that there is nothing ... </seg>
<seg id="389"> of which do you want to lighten up? </seg>
<seg id="390"> Do I have to invent something? If you want I can invent something bad. </seg>
<seg id="391"> No, we would miss ... I do not want you to invent anything. </seg>
<seg id="392"> You know, I'm your best friend </seg>
<seg id="393"> I want you to feel completely free to tell me the truth. </seg>
<seg id="394"> Tell me what you're worried about. </seg>
<seg id="395"> Can you stop breaking the balls? </seg>
<seg id="396"> Okay, I understand. I do not insist. </seg>
<seg id="397"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="398"> You are welcome. </seg>
<seg id="399"> Isaach, there is no problem. </seg>
<seg id="400"> Well, I know I'm going. </seg>
<seg id="401"> Already? </seg>
<seg id="402"> Yes, if I do not want to talk to you, I do not want it to be a problem. </seg>
<seg id="403"> There are no problems, Isaach. I got it? No problem. </seg>
<seg id="404"> understand, but listen. </seg>
<seg id="405"> If you do not want to talk to me now, call me whenever you want ... do you understand? </seg>
<seg id="406"> Maybe now is not the best time for you. </seg>
<seg id="407"> I was happy to see you. </seg>
<seg id="408"> Yes me too. </seg>
<seg id="409"> I'm sorry to disappoint you. But there's nothing wrong with it. </seg>
<seg id="410"> All right. </seg>
<seg id="411"> I get it. </seg>
<seg id="412"> No, you did not understand. </seg>
<seg id="413"> Call me when you want, Alex. </seg>
<seg id="414"> See you, Isaach. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Soon. </seg>
<seg id="416"> - Hello, what a pleasure to see you again. - Me too. </seg>
<seg id="417"> Centuries have passed. </seg>
<seg id="418"> Already. When was the last time? A couple of years ago in Sidney, did not you? </seg>
<seg id="419"> Two years ago, really? </seg>
<seg id="420"> Wow. How was Jeff and Beryl? </seg>
<seg id="421"> Usually, as usual. </seg>
<seg id="422"> Faithful to their strangeness by parents. </seg>
<seg id="423"> Do not Mr. Cate and his son travel with you? </seg>
<seg id="424"> Well, unfortunately. I'm alone. I'll see them next week. </seg>
<seg id="425"> - They are fine? - Yes, yes. I also want a child sooner or later. </seg>
<seg id="426"> What can I bring you? What do you want, Catie? </seg>
<seg id="427"> Oh, could I have an espresso? In big cup. </seg>
<seg id="428"> Even for me an espresso, double. Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="429"> And could I have some milk apart? Can you warm it up? </seg>
<seg id="430"> - We will do our utmost to please you. - Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Sorry for the delay. I know you only have ten minutes. </seg>
<seg id="432"> Do not worry. I wish I could be more. </seg>
<seg id="433"> Do you sleep here? Or do you see only journalists here? Make your number and away. </seg>
<seg id="434"> Oh no. I sleep here. And I do the interviews. </seg>
<seg id="435"> we do it in my suite, it's more convenient. </seg>
<seg id="436"> Since they are preparing the next one, I thought it would be nice to see you here. </seg>
<seg id="437"> No, thanks to Shelly, here you can not ... </seg>
<seg id="438"> Stop it. Do you want them tell you not to smoke? </seg>
<seg id="439"> - Go, cousin. - Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="440"> In short, they give you this megasuite, and then use it for advertising? </seg>
<seg id="441"> Exact. </seg>
<seg id="442"> It seems ... shabby. Well, it's still a suite, they split the spaces. </seg>
<seg id="443"> Yes, but could they take one for you and another for press meetings? </seg>
<seg id="444"> It's a cheap production. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Sure. </seg>
<seg id="446"> But it's still shabby. </seg>
<seg id="447"> Can I bring you anything else? </seg>
<seg id="448"> - No thanks, just like that. - You're welcome. </seg>
<seg id="449"> And so ... Entering was complicated, I risked not to do so until they realized I was your cousin. </seg>
<seg id="450"> There are several paparazzi underneath. </seg>
<seg id="451"> They will follow you everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="452"> Everywhere there are so-called "celebrities," I suppose. </seg>
<seg id="453"> Of course it must be a nice break of balls at times, no? </seg>
<seg id="454"> Not for me, I'm free! </seg>
<seg id="455"> Virtually in panties, but free. </seg>
<seg id="456"> No one runs here, it's a safe place. </seg>
<seg id="457"> Except when they swap for you. </seg>
<seg id="458"> Once they made me into a club because they thought I was you. </seg>
<seg id="459"> Then they understood and kicked me out. </seg>
<seg id="460"> What a fucking thing. </seg>
<seg id="461"> Do not deny it, it must be beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="462"> You have everything. You have a husband, a nice kid. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Turn around the world, stay in fantastic hotels. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Frequent parties and receptions ... </seg>
<seg id="465"> Well, you know the saying, "The neighbor's grass is getting greener." </seg>
<seg id="466"> And how it is ... </seg>
<seg id="467"> Shit. </seg>
<seg id="468"> - Johnny. - Who? </seg>
<seg id="469"> Jimmy ... Tim ... Tommy. Sorry, how are you? Ah, Tommy ... </seg>
<seg id="470"> We left it two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Tommy. What a fucking head. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Now I'm with another, Lee. Remember? </seg>
<seg id="473"> Sounds in a group, I wrote to him. </seg>
<seg id="474"> It's an important part of my life. </seg>
<seg id="475"> Sorry, Shell, but you did not write to me. </seg>
<seg id="476"> Yeah fucking, I also sent you his CD! </seg>
<seg id="477"> Your secretary will not give it to you. </seg>
<seg id="478"> It does nothing, it does not matter. I know how your life is messed up </seg>
<seg id="479"> Do you remember when you sent it? No. One week you're at L.A, </seg>
<seg id="480"> Then in London, then in Sidney. </seg>
<seg id="481"> Fuck, every day you're in a different city. </seg>
<seg id="482"> I'd love to hear what she is doing, what kind of thing is it? </seg>
<seg id="483"> Well, it's stuff ... </seg>
<seg id="484"> It lasts ... </seg>
<seg id="485"> ... industrial, vibrant ... </seg>
<seg id="486"> I do not think you'd appreciate it. </seg>
<seg id="487"> How is the group called? Squrl. </seg>
<seg id="488"> Scuali. </seg>
<seg id="489"> No. Sqürl. Here they say so. </seg>
<seg id="490"> S-ü-q-r-l. On U you will know it. Squrl. </seg>
<seg id="491"> Oh Sqürl. I get it. </seg>
<seg id="492"> Can I buy the CD, if I do not find what you sent me? </seg>
<seg id="493"> No not yet. In the sense, they have incised it for trial. Then... </seg>
<seg id="494"> But I think the record company will make it out at last. </seg>
<seg id="495"> I think. </seg>
<seg id="496"> I have to find that CD at all costs so that I can give it a lifetime. </seg>
<seg id="497"> You never will. </seg>
<seg id="498"> Shell, you're bad, really ... </seg>
<seg id="499"> It's the truth, you will not find it. If you say so. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Also because I remembered now that in fact ... I did not send it to you. </seg>
<seg id="501"> I just thought about shipping. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Oh, I almost forgot. This is for you. </seg>
<seg id="503"> Thank you, what is it? </seg>
<seg id="504"> Ah, though, it's expensive stuff! You will be ruined! </seg>
<seg id="505"> Awesome, thank you very much. It makes me comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="506"> It will make me look like a movie star. </seg>
<seg id="507"> - Cheers. - Cin cin, beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="508"> Catie, seriously, thank you for this visit. </seg>
<seg id="509"> No thank you. </seg>
<seg id="510"> And thank you for the gift. </seg>
<seg id="511"> Imagine, nothing. </seg>
<seg id="512"> It's a promotional gift, right? </seg>
<seg id="513"> They will give you everything for free, no. Jewelery, clothes ... probably even cars ... </seg>
<seg id="514"> No, cars have never given me. Every once in a while I get cosmetics for gift, but I thought ... ... I do not know, I wanted ... </seg>
<seg id="515"> I never had time to shop. </seg>
<seg id="516"> Do not worry, I like it. And then it's stuff you need </seg>
<seg id="517"> Do not you think it's fun? when something you can not afford ... ... costs a lot. </seg>
<seg id="518"> And when you can do it ... ... it's free. </seg>
<seg id="519"> Do not you feel absurd? </seg>
<seg id="520"> The world is a bit like that. In many ways. </seg>
<seg id="521"> Oh, about paparazzi, </seg>
<seg id="522"> The other day I saw your photos in the newspaper. </seg>
<seg id="523"> Do not even name me ... </seg>
<seg id="524"> How was she dressed? </seg>
<seg id="525"> Sorry... </seg>
<seg id="526"> Ready? Hi Lindsey. </seg>
<seg id="527"> I'm down at the bar, with my cousin, Shelly. </seg>
<seg id="528"> Already ready, really? </seg>
<seg id="529"> Okay, in a minute I'm up. Hello. </seg>
<seg id="530"> - Back to work? - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="531"> You go back to the mine. </seg>
<seg id="532"> Do you want to come with me? </seg>
<seg id="533"> Nothing interesting, but if you want to come to me does a lot of pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="534"> Looking at you as you interview TV? </seg>
<seg id="535"> What's "Everything Doing"? </seg>
<seg id="536"> Yes. You could send me that CD, I have a letter. </seg>
<seg id="537"> You would not read it. Stop it, if I send it I'll read it. </seg>
<seg id="538"> - Now I have to go. - Yeah. - I'm sorry. </seg>
<seg id="539"> - Yeah. - It was nice to see you. - Yes. - Do you have my numbers? - Sure. </seg>
<seg id="540"> Be good. Hug me all. </seg>
<seg id="541"> And you hug the others. </seg>
<seg id="542"> Always remember me. </seg>
<seg id="543"> - Hello Catie. - We'll see Shell. </seg>
<seg id="544"> Put it all on my account, if you add more as well. </seg>
<seg id="545"> Maybe next time, Lou is there. Sure. </seg>
<seg id="546"> It's called Lee. </seg>
<seg id="547"> Ahh, sorry. </seg>
<seg id="548"> Can I have a double tequila, thanks? And the menu. </seg>
<seg id="549"> Excuse me, here's no smoking. </seg>
<seg id="550"> So, Jack, do not you talk about your Tesla coil? </seg>
<seg id="551"> You said you did not want to talk to me. </seg>
<seg id="552"> Yes I know. Before. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Now I do not know if I still want to talk about it. </seg>
<seg id="554"> Give Jack. You dragged her up here with your pickup truck. </seg>
<seg id="555"> Up, parlamene. </seg>
<seg id="556"> To create it, I have followed the inventions of the inventor, Nikola Tesla. </seg>
<seg id="557"> It's a transformer ... ... with two coils tuned to resonate. </seg>
<seg id="558"> In pairs it is a progressive transformer ... ... that converts current from low to high voltage, and vice versa. At high frequencies. </seg>
<seg id="559"> Do you remember that when we were young, did you have the mirror to make up for Barbie? </seg>
<seg id="560"> Yes, I remember it. </seg>
<seg id="561"> There was a small fluorescent lamp. </seg>
<seg id="562"> Well, Nikola Tesla invented that light. </seg>
<seg id="563"> Without him we would not have the alternating current ... ... the radio, the TV, the X-rays the induction motor, the particle accelerator, the laser. </seg>
<seg id="564"> Without him, there would be none of these things. </seg>
<seg id="565"> Not even the rock band, the Tesla. </seg>
<seg id="566"> Funny. </seg>
<seg id="567"> Tesla was a real genius. </seg>
<seg id="568"> If they had paid more attention to his ideas ... Now the world would be better: mass free communications Free shipping. Free energy for everyone. </seg>
<seg id="569"> That's why, in the end, they set it apart. For free energy. </seg>
<seg id="570"> He perceived the earth ... ... like an acoustic resonator. </seg>
<seg id="571"> Beautiful idea. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Then you show me how the coil works? </seg>
<seg id="573"> Sure. </seg>
<seg id="574"> You need these. </seg>
<seg id="575"> - Okay, are you ready for Meg? - Ready. </seg>
<seg id="576"> Fuck! Something must have been broken. </seg>
<seg id="577"> Nice stuff, though. </seg>
<seg id="578"> Yes, but it is not scheduled to stop. But to go on What will happen. </seg>
<seg id="579"> Is not that you burned the condenser? </seg>
<seg id="580"> No, I did not burn a condenser, Meg. </seg>
<seg id="581"> Maybe the difference was missed. </seg>
<seg id="582"> Yes, "The lifesaver." </seg>
<seg id="583"> I know what a difference! But it does not matter. </seg>
<seg id="584"> Do not pity with me. </seg>
<seg id="585"> Maybe the spinterometers are too distant on the induction spool. </seg>
<seg id="586"> It could be. </seg>
<seg id="587"> I think. </seg>
<seg id="588"> Yes, that's for that. You are right. </seg>
<seg id="589"> That's one thing I did not control. </seg>
<seg id="590"> Well, I go home to see how to fix it. </seg>
<seg id="591"> Tomorrow you go to bowling? Yes, I find it there. </seg>
<seg id="592"> Perfect, let's see it then. </seg>
<seg id="593"> Earth as an acoustic resonant conductor. </seg>
<seg id="594"> Ready? Ready, who are you? </seg>
<seg id="595"> Laura, hello. I'm Alfred Molina, I was looking for Steve Coogan. </seg>
<seg id="596"> Alfred Molina. </seg>
<seg id="597"> M-o-l-i-n-a. </seg>
<seg id="598"> The actor, of course. I wanted to be sure Steve remembers ... </seg>
<seg id="599"> ... Ah yes, fine !. </seg>
<seg id="600"> Casomai would serve, my number is Ready? </seg>
<seg id="601"> Hello, Alfred? Hi, Steve. </seg>
<seg id="602"> Hello! I'm so glad you did it, sit down! </seg>
<seg id="603"> I was talking to Laura, your assistant, I was wondering if you were coming. </seg>
<seg id="604"> - Here I am. - Fantastic. </seg>
<seg id="605"> I ordered tea. </seg>
<seg id="606"> Do I make you from mom? </seg>
<seg id="607"> Let me stay, I'll do it from Mom alone. </seg>
<seg id="608"> Here is milk. </seg>
<seg id="609"> - A real tea! - Yeah ... </seg>
<seg id="610"> It's hard to get used to it. </seg>
<seg id="611"> I have this idea ... ... if I ever win an Oscar, or a GOlden Globe, </seg>
<seg id="612"> I want to take the satisfaction of teaching yankee to do a good job. </seg>
<seg id="613"> - Tea made as it should be. - cheers. </seg>
<seg id="614"> I love .. I love your overcoat. </seg>
<seg id="615"> It's a Westwood. Viv Westwood. </seg>
<seg id="616"> I have a weakness for British designers. </seg>
<seg id="617"> I do not know what goes on in the head of the American ones. </seg>
<seg id="618"> Are too much, how to say? Cautious. </seg>
<seg id="619"> Are not you hot? Outside there are 30 °. </seg>
<seg id="620"> - When I get out I'll take it off. - Oh. </seg>
<seg id="621"> - It's for air conditioning. - Right. </seg>
<seg id="622"> How much are you living here in L. A? It's been around 7 years. </seg>
<seg id="623"> - Wow. - I really like it here. </seg>
<seg id="624"> It's a long time now. I like to come out every now and then. </seg>
<seg id="625"> As I always say, it is nice to live but to go even further. </seg>
<seg id="626"> The palm trees ... The palms make me really crap. </seg>
<seg id="627"> It's not a place for everyone. </seg>
<seg id="628"> I do not mind, but I came especially for work. </seg>
<seg id="629"> It's nice ... it's nice to meet you, finally. </seg>
<seg id="630"> I have to admit that I'm your big fan. </seg>
<seg id="631"> All your shows, from things to TV and comedies ... </seg>
<seg id="632"> I have them all in the box. Let me ship it, great. </seg>
<seg id="633"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="634"> You know ... It's reciprocal, I know who you are. </seg>
<seg id="635"> Ah, thank you. </seg>
<seg id="636"> I've seen the TV series you did. </seg>
<seg id="637"> Really? </seg>
<seg id="638"> - Yeah. - Wow. Interesting. </seg>
<seg id="639"> - They canceled us. - I heard it. </seg>
<seg id="640"> Making comedies is a tough thing. </seg>
<seg id="641"> Yes. However, your career seems to be fine. That is, you've got a lot of success lately. </seg>
<seg id="642"> - Yeah. - And for this? </seg>
<seg id="643"> - Well, you know ... the usual rounds of meetings. </seg>
<seg id="644"> It's nice that "finally" ... ... people started to notice me. </seg>
<seg id="645"> - Have you made interesting offers? - Yup... </seg>
<seg id="646"> I have to confess ... you were great in '24 Hour '... </seg>
<seg id="647"> Really "24 Hour Party People". - It's a great job. - Thanks so much. </seg>
<seg id="648"> - A real bomb. - Has been... </seg>
<seg id="649"> And the reviews. </seg>
<seg id="650"> Fuck, they were all positive. </seg>
<seg id="651"> I am surprised that so many people have read cultural references of all kinds. </seg>
<seg id="652"> A kind of Manchester early 80s, the music scene ... </seg>
<seg id="653"> Surprising. </seg>
<seg id="654"> Because they were so many to have no references </seg>
<seg id="655"> Because of .. Maybe they know rock groups </seg>
<seg id="656"> But the whole, your character, the fact that he leads the show ... </seg>
<seg id="657"> Would you like a cigarette? </seg>
<seg id="658"> - I'm sorry, but I'm French. - Anyway, thank you. </seg>
<seg id="659"> I hold it for later. </seg>
<seg id="660"> Oh, okay. </seg>
<seg id="661"> Laura said ... ... that you were not in the skin for our encounter, but he did not tell me why. </seg>
<seg id="662"> I did not want to talk on the phone because it might seem strange. </seg>
<seg id="663"> Imagine what she would have thought, for her I was an alien. </seg>
<seg id="664"> The phone, never seen or heard at all, "I would like to talk to Steve Coogan" </seg>
<seg id="665"> But I wanted to see you personally. </seg>
<seg id="666"> Knowing they came for a while here ... </seg>
<seg id="667"> I thought it would be the perfect time ... </seg>
<seg id="668"> Anyway, I get to the point. I'm so excited! </seg>
<seg id="669"> I'm a premise ... I've always had a weakness for history. you know, and how people lived. ... and for all the events that take us from A to B. </seg>
<seg id="670"> The details of people's lives are full of epic ... ... full of epic qualities, do you follow me? </seg>
<seg id="671"> So I started this research. </seg>
<seg id="672"> And in short ... this is the result. </seg>
<seg id="673"> And to what extent is it? Is this a project already funded or being treated? How do you proceed? </seg>
<seg id="674"> No apology, which embarrassment ... is not ... </seg>
<seg id="675"> It's not work, work has nothing to do with it. It's not a script </seg>
<seg id="676"> It's a genealogy research. And what I've discovered is that ... </seg>
<seg id="677"> Mr Coogan? Yup? </seg>
<seg id="678"> - Is she right? - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="679"> I'm a big fan of it. Not so great at the end. </seg>
<seg id="680"> Could I ask for an autograph? - Sure. - How beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="681"> I was recognized, where did she want it? </seg>
<seg id="682"> A piece of paper will go more than well. Sin. </seg>
<seg id="683"> - Oh, no. Not here. - Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="684"> - I should have something in my bag. - Okay. </seg>
<seg id="685"> Give me a second. </seg>
<seg id="686"> Oh God, excuse me. It's all right. </seg>
<seg id="687"> - Give me another minute. - How much you want. </seg>
<seg id="688"> Here, here for courtesy. - Okay, what's your name? - Katy. </seg>
<seg id="689"> - Katy. - With Y. </seg>
<seg id="690"> Then "To Katy ..." </seg>
<seg id="691"> - Hello. - Alfred is also an actor. </seg>
<seg id="692"> - Yup? - Thank you, that's beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="693"> - Thanks so much. - Do not mention it. </seg>
<seg id="694"> - Wow ... - Let's go back to us. </seg>
<seg id="695"> I do not want to steal you too long. - I know you're very busy ... - Right. </seg>
<seg id="696"> As I was saying, I did genealogical research. </seg>
<seg id="697"> I did it just for my own interest ... I was not looking for anything special. And I came across this. </seg>
<seg id="698"> I'll let you short. Steve Coogan ... </seg>
<seg id="699"> Drumroll. </seg>
<seg id="700"> The fact is this. </seg>
<seg id="701"> We're cousins. </seg>
<seg id="702"> What do you mean? Artistically? </seg>
<seg id="703"> No. No. No! In the normal sense. We are cousins, relatives. </seg>
<seg id="704"> Wow. - Is not it fantastic? - Of course, but ... are you sure? </seg>
<seg id="705"> Things would be so ... </seg>
<seg id="706"> My grandpa is your pro-god. </seg>
<seg id="707"> And, going further, we have a common bis-bis-great-grandfather. </seg>
<seg id="708"> Ah, though! Of course my ancestors are Irish, but I also knew an Italian ... </seg>
<seg id="709"> Back to all! The Italian ancestor is our bis-bis-bis-great-grandfather, Giuseppe. </seg>
<seg id="710"> - Wow. - It's incredible? </seg>
<seg id="711"> There are a lot of details. </seg>
<seg id="712"> It is my field, more or less, I enjoy it. Fantastic. </seg>
<seg id="713"> For me it would be amazing to say that I'm relative to Steve Coogan. </seg>
<seg id="714"> And I, in turn, can say that I'm relative to Albert Molina. </seg>
<seg id="715"> Alfred. </seg>
<seg id="716"> Yes ... It's actually my grandmother ... ... the most ferret. </seg>
<seg id="717"> It will go into ecstasy. It's your fan. He adored you in ... </seg>
<seg id="718"> Boogie Nights. </seg>
<seg id="719"> Ah, yes, with shorts and doubles? </seg>
<seg id="720"> Once he spoke to me. </seg>
<seg id="721"> What a beauty, I understand that I find you a little lacking. But think about how many possibilities. </seg>
<seg id="722"> It's great, sorry, let's make the point. </seg>
<seg id="723"> We are both actors. We are cousins, and now it's crazy. </seg>
<seg id="724"> We could ... you know, work together. </seg>
<seg id="725"> We could make a movie. </seg>
<seg id="726"> We could make a movie about our story. </seg>
<seg id="727"> The story of two actors who find themselves cousins. </seg>
<seg id="728"> We could interpret ourselves. </seg>
<seg id="729"> We'll be Fred Molina and Coog ... We'll be cousins ​​in life and ... In the movie. Is fantastic! </seg>
<seg id="730"> It would be wonderful! Absolutely gorgeous! </seg>
<seg id="731"> Or no, I mean ... we could only attend. </seg>
<seg id="732"> One day we should go drinking a beer, think about that beauty. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Maybe make a nice vacation together. Only we two, you know, to know us. </seg>
<seg id="734"> You're not homosexual, right? </seg>
<seg id="735"> No. No. No, no. I'm, I'm married. </seg>
<seg id="736"> Even James I, if that's what you mean. </seg>
<seg id="737"> Sorry, I came out like this. </seg>
<seg id="738"> You say it and do not think about it, follow me? I see. </seg>
<seg id="739"> I know exactly what you were thinking. </seg>
<seg id="740"> If someone is presenting me saying he's my cousin ... </seg>
<seg id="741"> I would take it for crazy. But quiet, I'm not. </seg>
<seg id="742"> I think for me it's a fantastic, exciting excerpt. </seg>
<seg id="743"> Absolutely. </seg>
<seg id="744"> - I just wanted you to know. - Same to you. </seg>
<seg id="745"> What I ask you is to take note of this extraordinary fact. And ... to love me. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Agree. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Now I have to go. </seg>
<seg id="748"> I did not tell you ... ... but I have a meeting, I moved it. I see. </seg>
<seg id="749"> At Universal. Administrative, lenders. </seg>
<seg id="750"> So ... That would be, would ... - It's for you. - Good. It's yours. </seg>
<seg id="751"> I will check that I do not lose it. Sure. </seg>
<seg id="752"> You stay here for a couple of days, right? </seg>
<seg id="753"> If so we could see it again before your departure. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Yes, ah ... ok, check in my mental agenda </seg>
<seg id="755"> I'm afraid that's not possible. </seg>
<seg id="756"> For the days when I'm here, I'm always busy. - I see. - I'm very busy. Listen to me, no problem. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Give me your cell phone number, I'll call you back before you tell me. </seg>
<seg id="758"> There is a problem. On the ... </seg>
<seg id="759"> Here's a band system that's different ... ... from the English one. It's a casino, our cell phones </seg>
<seg id="760"> Our cell phones here do not work. Here in the US they are cell phone, practically. I understand, well ... give me your home number, I'll call you there. </seg>
<seg id="761"> - You have my assistant's number, right? - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="762"> Well then, we're in touch. </seg>
<seg id="763"> Could not you give me your home number? </seg>
<seg id="764"> Can I say no? There is absolutely nothing ... ... nothing personal. Only... </seg>
<seg id="765"> I never gave my house number to anyone. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Defense of personal space, always avoided ... It's a rule. </seg>
<seg id="767"> ... And I always think, "Follow the rule." You understand, do not you? </seg>
<seg id="768"> Treat yourself to the rule. In fact, it's more a philosophy than a rule. </seg>
<seg id="769"> I can boast ... that I have refused my number ... ... to several V.I.P., in the past </seg>
<seg id="770"> Once I even refused to Sam Mendes, then you have company. </seg>
<seg id="771"> If it's okay for Sam Mendes, that's fine for me. </seg>
<seg id="772"> Exactly. - I know it's mine. - Sure, mine does not work. </seg>
<seg id="773"> Sorry, but I have to answer. </seg>
<seg id="774"> Ready? </seg>
<seg id="775"> Yes sure. </seg>
<seg id="776"> Spike, hello, how are you doing? </seg>
<seg id="777"> Yes, did you receive the message? </seg>
<seg id="778"> My agent wanted a confirmation. </seg>
<seg id="779"> No, the producer does not have a good reputation ... we have to be careful of everything, artistic integrity, and all that stuff there. </seg>
<seg id="780"> Otherwise everything will get out of hand. </seg>
<seg id="781"> How much are you asshole. </seg>
<seg id="782"> All right, Sunday is confirmed? </seg>
<seg id="783"> Fine, can we see you there? </seg>
<seg id="784"> Better as soon as possible. Perfect. A hug. Hi Spike. </seg>
<seg id="785"> - You have to apologize. - Do not even mention it. </seg>
<seg id="786"> But ... that ... was ... was Spike Lee? </seg>
<seg id="787"> Oh no, no, no. I do not know Spike Lee. No, it was Spike Jonze. </seg>
<seg id="788"> - Spike Jonze! - I love it! - He's a good man, Spike. </seg>
<seg id="789"> We are friends from a lifetime. </seg>
<seg id="790"> In addition to enthusiastic hikers. I boring you. No, no, no, continue. </seg>
<seg id="791"> We belong to a club. And on weekends we walk in the middle of nature. </seg>
<seg id="792"> He is a very convivial environmentalist. </seg>
<seg id="793"> Spike Jonze is a paladin of organic foods ... Jesus, I had never seen him in this light. </seg>
<seg id="794"> He prefers to be called "green". Like me, by the way. </seg>
<seg id="795"> Of course, I do not misunderstand ... ... it's beautiful, I love the trees. </seg>
<seg id="796"> Maybe there were more. Paper is used on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="797"> I'd love ... you know, I want to abolish the phone number rule ... it's bullshit. </seg>
<seg id="798"> Would it be rude to give it to you now? </seg>
<seg id="799"> Yes, that's fine. Right. </seg>
<seg id="800"> I have to go, sorry. </seg>
<seg id="801"> - I think in the bill. - Good. </seg>
<seg id="802"> 'Fuck ... </seg>
<seg id="803"> Do you think RZA, where the fuck are you? </seg>
<seg id="804"> - Hey, hey, pace. - Bobby ... </seg>
<seg id="805"> Sorry, late, cousin. Do not worry, I was going to call you. What a fuck, an emergency visit. </seg>
<seg id="806"> - Emergency visit? - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="807"> The sons of Sophia and Sifu took the virus. </seg>
<seg id="808"> So I went to give her herbal medicines. </seg>
<seg id="809"> I took it away from milk and its derivatives, only citric acid ... ... should heal quickly. </seg>
<seg id="810"> Since you are a doctor? I've already said! </seg>
<seg id="811"> I've been studying alternative medicine for two years. </seg>
<seg id="812"> Ancient healing techniques, and such things. </seg>
<seg id="813"> Listen to this. There is a procedure I could run using a drill. </seg>
<seg id="814"> An electric drill. I'm serious. </seg>
<seg id="815"> And then, having made the DJ with my hands the cable. </seg>
<seg id="816"> Music and medicine for me go hand in hand. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Like two planets in orbit around the same sun. </seg>
<seg id="818"> - Do you want some tea? - Thanks, thank you </seg>
<seg id="819"> It's herbs, no caffeine. </seg>
<seg id="820"> No caffeine. It's absurd. Do not say that to me. </seg>
<seg id="821"> Trust, depression comes. And makes it irritable. </seg>
<seg id="822"> Accelerates your pulse, heartbeat, you understand? </seg>
<seg id="823"> And, worse, every time you have a coffee fill your body of shit. </seg>
<seg id="824"> Do you know the point? That's why I try to stay away. </seg>
<seg id="825"> I stopped with that shit. - Clean and healthy: no caffeine. </seg>
<seg id="826"> - To the Liquid Swords, cousin. - Bobby Digital. </seg>
<seg id="827"> - Wu-Tang forever. - Wu-Tang forever. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Does anyone still want coffee? </seg>
<seg id="829"> - The kitchen closes. - No, we do not poison ourselves with caffeine. </seg>
<seg id="830"> - Well? - No. </seg>
<seg id="831"> Do you know that caffeine causes delirium? </seg>
<seg id="832"> - Delirious? - Even in serious shape. </seg>
<seg id="833"> Now I understand everything! It may be this: delusion. </seg>
<seg id="834"> Are not you Bill Murray? This ... are you Bill Murray? Yes, I'm Bill Murray, but what's left between us, you know? You stay with us. </seg>
<seg id="835"> And between you two there is some connection? </seg>
<seg id="836"> Yes, we are cousins. </seg>
<seg id="837"> You're taking me for the ass, you're two planks. </seg>
<seg id="838"> - Piantagrane! - Del Wu-Tang clan. </seg>
<seg id="839"> Yes, Wu-Tang Clan. </seg>
<seg id="840"> - You are GZA, the genius. - Right. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - And you are RZA ... - Aka? </seg>
<seg id="842"> Bobby Digital. He knows everything about hip-hop, yo knows everything about hip-hop. </seg>
<seg id="843"> And you are Bill Murray. </seg>
<seg id="844"> "Resumed from head" Murray "Inculafantasmi" Murray </seg>
<seg id="845"> - Great name! - I know who I am, do not say it. </seg>
<seg id="846"> What does it mean, "Do not fuck him," you see you're Bill Murray. </seg>
<seg id="847"> There goes a lot of people here and they will recognize you. You're Bill Murray, of course. </seg>
<seg id="848"> Unless you dress, or something. </seg>
<seg id="849"> In a sense, I'm disguised. </seg>
<seg id="850"> Of course it's ugly, huh? </seg>
<seg id="851"> You're really a caffeine-dependent. What's left between us, cigars. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Before I quit ... ... I liked drinking it before going to sleep. Accelerated dreams. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Like in Indianapolis, with cameras on racing cars. And they too. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Everything went fast, like dreams. </seg>
<seg id="855"> - What a stupid thing. - She's stupid, huh? </seg>
<seg id="856"> I know a guy who freezes coffee, and puts us sticks ... and he's got a nice icicle. - A cauliflower icicle. </seg>
<seg id="857"> Damn ... I do not like much, Bill Murray! </seg>
<seg id="858"> No, it's not the flu, it's the smoker's cough. </seg>
<seg id="859"> That's what I was telling you. Nicotine. Nicotine interacts with the central nervous system, with the respiratory system. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Already in minimal doses gives paralysis. </seg>
<seg id="861"> - Really? - Yes, really. </seg>
<seg id="862"> It has been shown that only 50 milligrams ... can be fatal in a few minutes. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - And how many in a cigarette? - 3 milligrams. </seg>
<seg id="864"> And did you know that nicotine is also used as an insecticide? He kills the bugs. It's not bad if he kills the bugs, right? </seg>
<seg id="865"> Are you a bug, Bill Murray? </seg>
<seg id="866"> - Holy God, RZA, speak like my doctor. - He's a doctor ... </seg>
<seg id="867"> Currently specialized in ... alternative medicine. </seg>
<seg id="868"> That is, alternative to this country. </seg>
<seg id="869"> Well, make me a favor: Do not tell me I'm here. </seg>
<seg id="870"> - You can trust Bill Murray. - What's up, Bill Murray, hide you? Yes, more or less. </seg>
<seg id="871"> I start to think it's delirium. </seg>
<seg id="872"> - Severe delusions. - Women. </seg>
<seg id="873"> If you are going to run away, I have something to help you. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Here. </seg>
<seg id="875"> - Use whatever you want. - Caspita! </seg>
<seg id="876"> Stay calm, make you invisible. It's a good deal. You did not have to, it's amazing. </seg>
<seg id="877"> All for you, Bill </seg>
<seg id="878"> - Thank you. - Imagine. </seg>
<seg id="879"> I appreciate it. </seg>
<seg id="880"> Is fantastic. </seg>
<seg id="881"> Doctor, what can I do for this cough? </seg>
<seg id="882"> I was thinking about it now. Listen to me well. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - Take hydrogenated water. - We have it for the small wounds. </seg>
<seg id="884"> Mix half the hydrogen peroxide and half the tap water. </seg>
<seg id="885"> And then you make a gargle. Spit it. </seg>
<seg id="886"> Do not let her down, Bill Murray. </seg>
<seg id="887"> And if it does not work, try it with acid. </seg>
<seg id="888"> There I also have that. </seg>
<seg id="889"> - Thank you. - Imagine. </seg>
<seg id="890"> Thanks, I'll try it right away. </seg>
<seg id="891"> - Great. - Great. </seg>
<seg id="892"> Bill "rattinculo" Murray! Crazy. </seg>
<seg id="893"> - Yo. Yo. Yo. Yo, I'm three. - And with that? </seg>
<seg id="894"> Ghosts should arrive at three o'clock. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Be quiet, put your heart in peace. It's never punctual. </seg>
<seg id="896"> We'll be here all night. Do you think we can make a joint? </seg>
<seg id="897"> No, there's a lot of police here. But once we smoked here. </seg>
<seg id="898"> As long as Dirt Dog has not bothered the place. </seg>
<seg id="899"> I told him at Deflon "Do not let Dirt Dog get in here." </seg>
<seg id="900"> And then what? </seg>
<seg id="901"> - Let's go to the studio. - Right, check out? - Yeah. - It's gone then. </seg>
<seg id="902"> No account, we have limited credit. - He does not need money. - We still pay. </seg>
<seg id="903"> What do I do, leave him a tip? </seg>
<seg id="904"> You say he's using acid? I do not know, but let's get rid of the dick. </seg>
<seg id="905"> Are you okay, Taylor? </seg>
<seg id="906"> Not too much. What's up? </seg>
<seg id="907"> I do not know. I feel divorced from the world. </seg>
<seg id="908"> I lost contact with the world. </seg>
<seg id="909"> Do you know that Mahler song? </seg>
<seg id="910"> "I've Lost the Track Of The World"? (Of the world I have lost every trace) No. </seg>
<seg id="911"> It's one of the most beautiful ... and sad songs have never been written. </seg>
<seg id="912"> It almost seems to me to hear it. </seg>
<seg id="913"> Do you feel it? </seg>
<seg id="914"> Oh... </seg>
<seg id="915"> Now there is no more, but did you hear it before? I think so. </seg>
<seg id="916"> He resonated throughout the building. </seg>
<seg id="917"> Where we are? In Armory, Taylor. "In Armory, Taylor" </seg>
<seg id="918"> It has such a heavy sound. </seg>
<seg id="919"> The Armory. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Nikola Tesla. </seg>
<seg id="921"> He perceived Earth as a conductor ... ... of acoustic resonance. </seg>
<seg id="922"> I have no idea what you are talking about. </seg>
<seg id="923"> Could you explain yourself better? </seg>
<seg id="924"> Actually no. I have an idea, pretend that this coffee is champagne. </seg>
<seg id="925"> And why? </seg>
<seg id="926"> To celebrate life. </seg>
<seg id="927"> How rich, elegant people do. </seg>
<seg id="928"> Classy people. </seg>
<seg id="929"> I prefer Coffee, The Honest Cafe of the Proletarians. </seg>
<seg id="930"> You're so provincial, Bill. Do you know what your problem is? </seg>
<seg id="931"> Which? </seg>
<seg id="932"> You do not have "joie de vivre". </seg>
<seg id="933"> No? </seg>
<seg id="934"> No, and more, this coffee sucks. </seg>
<seg id="935"> You're right, it really sucks. Disgusting. </seg>
<seg id="936"> I propose a toast. </seg>
<seg id="937"> A toast to what? </seg>
<seg id="938"> Holy sky, boh ... in Paris </seg>
<seg id="939"> in the 1920s. Josephine Baker ... The Moulin Rouge ... </seg>
<seg id="940"> What's the matter ... what's up ... pa-pa ... </seg>
<seg id="941"> And even in New York. In the 70s. Towards the end. </seg>
<seg id="942"> Really? All right. </seg>
<seg id="943"> - Cheers. - Cheers. </seg>
<seg id="944"> "Délicieux", right? </seg>
<seg id="945"> Ahh, champagne. The God of the Gods! </seg>
<seg id="946"> Everything here your lunch? A coffee and a cigarette? </seg>
<seg id="947"> It is not very healthy. </seg>
<seg id="948"> We had lunch before. Before? </seg>
<seg id="949"> Now let's break, coffee break. </seg>
<seg id="950"> What a sadness. </seg>
<seg id="951"> And how long does this break? </seg>
<seg id="952"> A dozen minutes is almost over. </seg>
<seg id="953"> Tell me that's not true. </seg>
<seg id="954"> - So what? </seg>
<seg id="955"> I asked you to tell me that it is not true. </seg>
<seg id="956"> Tell you that this is not true? </seg>
<seg id="957"> Do nothing, do nothing, do nothing. Leave it alone. </seg>
<seg id="958"> I, anyway, have to rest. </seg>
<seg id="959"> Wake me up when the pause ends. </seg>
<seg id="960"> You have two short minutes to rest. </seg>
