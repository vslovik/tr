<seg id="1"> Steven. Hi. </seg>
<seg id="2"> - Sit down. - Roberto? </seg>
<seg id="3"> - I'm all wound up. - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="4"> You're wound up? I'm wound up, too. </seg>
<seg id="5"> - Yes. - All wound up. </seg>
<seg id="6"> - What are you drinking? Coffee? - Coffee, yes. </seg>
<seg id="7"> - Very good for me. For you? - I love coffee. </seg>
<seg id="8"> - You love it, too? - I love it. </seg>
<seg id="9"> - Steve. - Steven. </seg>
<seg id="10"> I love coffee. </seg>
<seg id="11"> What do you do? </seg>
<seg id="12"> You know, I just relax, sit around, maybe have a cigarette. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Cigarettes and coffee I think go together good. </seg>
<seg id="14"> You think you drink too much of it? </seg>
<seg id="15"> No. Coffee is good for health. </seg>
<seg id="16"> I like to drink before I go to sleep. </seg>
<seg id="17"> I drink a lot of coffee before I go to sleep so I can dream faster. </seg>
<seg id="18"> I can dream like when they put a camera on the Indy 500... when they put a camera in the car, and it's just whipping by like that. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Dream after dream after dream after dream. </seg>
<seg id="20"> People ask me the next day, what did you dream about? </seg>
<seg id="21"> I say, I don't have time. I don't have time to tell you this. </seg>
<seg id="22"> - Do you smoke? - Only when I drink coffee. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Do you know my mother? </seg>
<seg id="24"> - Do I know your mother? - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="25"> I don't know. I don't think so. </seg>
<seg id="26"> - Coffee. They should freeze it, you know? - Yes. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Fill an ice-cube tray with coffee and put sticks in it, for kids. </seg>
<seg id="28"> So they can start when they're kids, when they're playing and stuff. Like a Popsicle. A caffeine Popsicle. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Very good. I don't understand nothing. Yes. </seg>
<seg id="30"> - Can you hear me? - What? </seg>
<seg id="31"> Can you hear me? It's very loud over here. </seg>
<seg id="32"> You having trouble hearing me? Maybe we should switch. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Yes, thank you very much. I'd like to switch. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Good here. </seg>
<seg id="35"> - Good? - I kind of liked it better over there. </seg>
<seg id="36"> - You go... - Do you mind? </seg>
<seg id="37"> Yes, me, too. I prefer, yes. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Steve, yes. </seg>
<seg id="39"> - When do you leave? - The United States? </seg>
<seg id="40"> No, here. </seg>
<seg id="41"> I have to leave soon, actually. I have a dentist appointment. </seg>
<seg id="42"> But I don't want to go. I don't like the dentist. </seg>
<seg id="43"> I gotta go, I guess. </seg>
<seg id="44"> - Yes. - I haven't gone in a while. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Good. You don't go? </seg>
<seg id="46"> - I should go, but I don't feel like going. - No? </seg>
<seg id="47"> I am free, very free. </seg>
<seg id="48"> You wanna go for me? </seg>
<seg id="49"> Thank you very much. </seg>
<seg id="50"> - You wanna go to the dentist? - Yes, I can go for you. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Great. </seg>
<seg id="52"> - Here's the address. - Good. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Good. Very good. </seg>
<seg id="54"> - The name of the guy. - Yeah, 4:30. </seg>
<seg id="55"> - Steven, thank you very much. - No problem. </seg>
<seg id="56"> - You don't mind? - No, thank you. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Dentist appointment, very good. </seg>
<seg id="58"> I have to go. I am sorry, Steve. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Steve, I have to go to the dentist. I am late. </seg>
<seg id="60"> - Thank you, excuse me. Sorry. - Take it easy, don't be late. </seg>
<seg id="61"> - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too, in a way. </seg>
<seg id="62"> What are we doing in Memphis, anyway? </seg>
<seg id="63"> - It was your idea to come here. - Your idea. </seg>
<seg id="64"> It was my idea? It was your idea. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Very funny. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Don't smoke those sawdust cigarettes in here. </seg>
<seg id="67"> I hate those things. </seg>
<seg id="68"> - So what? - What are you, a cowboy? </seg>
<seg id="69"> - These are fresh. This is fresh tobacco. - No, this is fresh. </seg>
<seg id="70"> - This is the stupid dope fresh cigarettes. - That stuff is stale. What are you, crazy? </seg>
<seg id="71"> - I'm not crazy. - Shut up. </seg>
<seg id="72"> How we doing here? Need a refill? </seg>
<seg id="73"> - Yeah. - No. </seg>
<seg id="74"> - Sir? - Yes. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Shit. I'm sorry. </seg>
<seg id="76"> - Come on, what are you doing, man? - Damn, I'm sorry about that. </seg>
<seg id="77"> Let's not even pay the check. This place is terrible. </seg>
<seg id="78"> This all you're gonna have? </seg>
<seg id="79"> - Give me a light. - Just coffee and cigarettes? </seg>
<seg id="80"> That's not too healthy, is it now? </seg>
<seg id="81"> - Can I get you a sandwich or something? - No. </seg>
<seg id="82"> - Y'all from around here? - No. </seg>
<seg id="83"> Are you brother and sister? </seg>
<seg id="84"> - Yes. - No. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Are you two twins? </seg>
<seg id="86"> - Yes. - No. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Yes, we are. </seg>
<seg id="88"> I thought so. You know who y'all remind me of? </seg>
<seg id="89"> - Who? - Heckle and Jeckle. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Shit. </seg>
<seg id="91"> You know, the talking magpies? </seg>
<seg id="92"> Anyway, who's the evil twin? That's the way it works, right? </seg>
<seg id="93"> - This coffee tastes like mud. - Really. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Which one of us do you think looks like the evil one? </seg>
<seg id="95"> I'd say he's the evil one, right? He's got the evil eye. </seg>
<seg id="96"> - I'm only kidding. - You better be. </seg>
<seg id="97"> You know, I just thought of something, with you two being twins and all. </seg>
<seg id="98"> - Did y'all go to Graceland yet? - No. </seg>
<seg id="99"> You should. It's real cool. </seg>
<seg id="100"> - Mind if I sit down? - Yes, I do. </seg>
<seg id="101"> Yes, you can sit down. What are you, on a break? </seg>
<seg id="102"> Not really, but it's kind of slow. Tell you what, you can help me out. </seg>
<seg id="103"> Just stay right there. You got me covered and my boss can't see me. </seg>
<seg id="104"> It's his evil nature, right? </seg>
<seg id="105"> Anyway, what I just thought of, </seg>
<seg id="106"> do you know that Elvis Presley's got a twin brother? </seg>
<seg id="107"> Yeah, his name is Jesse Garon. You know, Elvis' middle name is Aaron. </seg>
<seg id="108"> Aaron, Garon. Anyway, everybody thinks that he died at birth. </seg>
<seg id="109"> But my theory is... </seg>
<seg id="110"> that his mother didn't wanna raise two kids. She wasn't expecting twins. </seg>
<seg id="111"> She couldn't afford to raise both. </seg>
<seg id="112"> She gave one away. </seg>
<seg id="113"> She just sent one off. So Jesse grew up in Arkansas, or Mississippi, or something. </seg>
<seg id="114"> So he didn't know he had a brother, Elvis. But one day, like, 1968 or '69... </seg>
<seg id="115"> he's looking at himself in the mirror and says, "Damn, I look like Elvis". </seg>
<seg id="116"> So he comes to Memphis, looks up Elvis. </seg>
<seg id="117"> Elvis sees him, he says, "Yeah, you're my brother. I can't believe it!" </seg>
<seg id="118"> "How you doing? What can I do for you?" </seg>
<seg id="119"> And his brother says, "Well, I don't know". </seg>
<seg id="120"> "Sure would be nice to be you for one night." </seg>
<seg id="121"> So Elvis had this concert where his brother sang. </seg>
<seg id="122"> They tried to see if they could trick people. Damn if he didn't sound like his brother! </seg>
<seg id="123"> Then Elvis had an idea. </seg>
<seg id="124"> I'm tired of the music scene. I'll send him out on tour. </seg>
<seg id="125"> Big mistake, because it was his brother who started to go to Vegas... </seg>
<seg id="126"> and wear them big collars, the white jumpsuits, and the capes. </seg>
<seg id="127"> Elvis wouldn't do that. And it was his brother who got really fat. </seg>
<seg id="128"> You know, eating those banana-fried butter sandwiches and all. </seg>
<seg id="129"> The Colonel said, "We gotta get rid of this guy. He can't be Elvis anymore." </seg>
<seg id="130"> So they started feeding him pills. I think they killed him. </seg>
<seg id="131"> So what? What are you saying? What's the punch line? </seg>
<seg id="132"> - Y'all are Elvis fans? - No. </seg>
<seg id="133"> You wanna hear something about Elvis? I'll tell you something about him. </seg>
<seg id="134"> - You ever heard of Otis Blackwell? - No, ma'am. </seg>
<seg id="135"> - You ever heard of Junior Parker? - No, ma'am. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Yeah, I didn't think so. You know, Elvis robbed their music, man. </seg>
<seg id="137"> He paid them $10 for their music, and all these other black musicians, too. </seg>
<seg id="138"> - That's what I think of Elvis. - Here's where my theory fits. </seg>
<seg id="139"> I don't think it was Elvis. I think it was his brother. </seg>
<seg id="140"> So in that case, it's all right? </seg>
<seg id="141"> My favorite Elvis quote is, "The only thing colors can do for me is shine my shoes". </seg>
<seg id="142"> I don't think the King said that. See, I think it was his evil twin. </seg>
<seg id="143"> Danny, what you doing over there? You got tables to wait on. Come on. </seg>
<seg id="144"> - I'll be right back. - Yeah, don't get fired, man. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Slaphappy hillbilly. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Cheers. </seg>
<seg id="147"> Something smells funny in here. </seg>
<seg id="148"> Is that my shirt you got on? </seg>
<seg id="149"> No, I don't think so. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Yeah, I think it is. This doesn't smell like me. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Yeah? What do you smell like? </seg>
<seg id="152"> I smell like me, and this doesn't smell like me. </seg>
<seg id="153"> - I smell like me, too. - But this smells like you. </seg>
<seg id="154"> That's because I am me. </seg>
<seg id="155"> Is that my shirt? </seg>
<seg id="156"> - Why you always copying me, anyway? - I'm not copying you. </seg>
<seg id="157"> - Why don't you get your own style? - I have my own style. </seg>
<seg id="158"> No, you're always copying me. Your style is my style because you copy it. </seg>
<seg id="159"> - It's my style. - No, it's not your style. </seg>
<seg id="160"> Service is bad, the coffee is bad, the music sucks. </seg>
<seg id="161"> Those are my shoes. </seg>
<seg id="162"> - These are my shoes. - Those are my shoes. </seg>
<seg id="163"> - These are my shoes. - Those are my other shoes. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Bullshit. </seg>
<seg id="165"> - Hey. - Hey, Tom. </seg>
<seg id="166"> - All right. - I'm glad you could make it. </seg>
<seg id="167"> You are here. </seg>
<seg id="168"> You know, you can call me Jim. </seg>
<seg id="169"> I mean, you know, my friends call me Jim, or Jimmy, or Iggy, or Jiggy. </seg>
<seg id="170"> Call me Iggy. </seg>
<seg id="171"> Okay, all right, whichever way you go. I'll go either way, Jim or Iggy... </seg>
<seg id="172"> You call me Iggy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Look, I'm sorry I'm late, Jim. Boy, four-car pileup. </seg>
<seg id="174"> I delivered a baby this morning at about 9:00. </seg>
<seg id="175"> I was saving lives, I was out there on the highway, it was... </seg>
<seg id="176"> You know, there's nothing worse than roadside surgery. </seg>
<seg id="177"> You don't have your own tools, and it's just... It's murder. </seg>
<seg id="178"> I performed a tracheotomy with a ballpoint pen and... </seg>
<seg id="179"> I've been busy. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Wait a minute. You're a doctor? </seg>
<seg id="181"> Yeah, I'm a doctor. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Music and medicine, really. It's really been my thing. </seg>
<seg id="183"> It's combining the two and living in that place where they overlap. </seg>
<seg id="184"> A lot of people say it shows up in the music. I don't know. I mean, it's... </seg>
<seg id="185"> Well, okay. Yeah, I can see that. </seg>
<seg id="186"> Yeah, okay. I think the organization and the whole thing... </seg>
<seg id="187"> - The humanity, I guess. - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="188"> - The humanity of the thing. The regard. - Yeah, the regard. </seg>
<seg id="189"> - I guess it's a big day for you, then. - It is. It was a medical morning. </seg>
<seg id="190"> - Everybody's all right? - Everybody's fine. </seg>
<seg id="191"> You've been here a while, I see. </seg>
<seg id="192"> I've been here. Drinking a little coffee. </seg>
<seg id="193"> - Yeah, I see. - I ordered you some. </seg>
<seg id="194"> You ordered for me? </seg>
<seg id="195"> I mean, is it cool? Is that cool? </seg>
<seg id="196"> Yeah, okay. Coffee, yeah. </seg>
<seg id="197"> - I could go for a coffee. - Okay, man. </seg>
<seg id="198"> Come on, have some coffee. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Okay, coffee it is. </seg>
<seg id="200"> Are those your cigarettes? </seg>
<seg id="201"> No, they were just sitting here when I got here. </seg>
<seg id="202"> - You don't smoke, do you? - No. I gave it up. </seg>
<seg id="203"> - Not for me, either. - Boy, enough of that. </seg>
<seg id="204"> That was enough, 25 big ones. </seg>
<seg id="205"> - Finished. </seg>
<seg id="206"> - Got the energy now. </seg>
<seg id="207"> Since I quit, I mean, just everything... </seg>
<seg id="208"> Yeah, you're focused. </seg>
<seg id="209"> - Zeroed in. Bang, you know? - Me, too. </seg>
<seg id="210"> I feel sorry for suckers still puffing away, you know? </seg>
<seg id="211"> - No willpower. - No willpower. Pacifier. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Silly. You know, the beauty of quitting is, now that I've quit... </seg>
<seg id="213"> I can have one. Because I've quit. </seg>
<seg id="214"> I mean, it's just like jewelry. </seg>
<seg id="215"> You know, it's not really... I don't even inhale. </seg>
<seg id="216"> You want to join me in one? </seg>
<seg id="217"> Yeah, since I quit. Okay. </seg>
<seg id="218"> - Now that you've quit, you can have one. - Sure, yeah. </seg>
<seg id="219"> I can do that. All right. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Boy, thank you. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Yeah, you know what I mean? Now that we've quit... </seg>
<seg id="222"> Cigarettes and coffee, man. </seg>
<seg id="223"> That's a combination. </seg>
<seg id="224"> Can't beat it. </seg>
<seg id="225"> We're really the coffee-and-cigarettes generation, when you think about it. </seg>
<seg id="226"> You know what I mean? In the '40s, it was the pie-and-coffee generation. </seg>
<seg id="227"> Like Abbott and Costello on TV, man. They always wanted pie and coffee. </seg>
<seg id="228"> Yeah, like Abbott and Costello. They were always ordering pie and coffee. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Have some coffee. Have some pie and coffee. </seg>
<seg id="230"> What are you waiting for? </seg>
<seg id="231"> You hang out here a lot? </seg>
<seg id="232"> This is my hangout. </seg>
<seg id="233"> I just wondered, 'cause I didn't see anything of yours on the jukebox. </seg>
<seg id="234"> If you don't like it here, we could go down to Taco Bell or something. Maybe that's more your style. </seg>
<seg id="235"> What are you saying, man? You're saying I'm a Taco Bell kind of guy? </seg>
<seg id="236"> No. I mean, if you don't like it here. - You said you don't like it here. </seg>
<seg id="237"> - No, I didn't say that. </seg>
<seg id="238"> We could go to the International House of Pancakes. </seg>
<seg id="239"> Maybe that's more up your alley. I don't know. </seg>
<seg id="240"> I didn't say that. I don't wanna go to the International House of Pancakes. </seg>
<seg id="241"> I'm comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="242"> Coffee is good, though, at IHOP. </seg>
<seg id="243"> You like the coffee down there at IHOP? </seg>
<seg id="244"> I drink the coffee at IHOP. I like the coffee. You don't like it? </seg>
<seg id="245"> Yeah, man. I like the IHOP coffee. </seg>
<seg id="246"> - Classy brew. - Yeah, that's good coffee. </seg>
<seg id="247"> Yeah, that's good coffee at the IHOP. </seg>
<seg id="248"> I almost forgot. Listen. </seg>
<seg id="249"> I worked with this drummer the other day in LA. </seg>
<seg id="250"> And this guy, man, his name is Giant Robo. </seg>
<seg id="251"> He was clanging and banging really hard. Man, I thought of you. </seg>
<seg id="252"> Maybe you want to... This is somebody, I think you ought to check him out. </seg>
<seg id="253"> You mean, you think I need a professional drummer? I'm not good enough? </seg>
<seg id="254"> What are you talking about? </seg>
<seg id="255"> No, but I'm just... You know, it's a musician. </seg>
<seg id="256"> I thought... I just wanted to tell you about this guy. It'd be great, man. </seg>
<seg id="257"> It's hard and industrial, and he's beating, and I just thought, "wow". </seg>
<seg id="258"> What are you trying to tell me? I need a drummer? </seg>
<seg id="259"> I could use a drummer? </seg>
<seg id="260"> The drumming on my records sucks? What are you saying? </seg>
<seg id="261"> Forget it, man. </seg>
<seg id="262"> You know what? - I think I really got to get going. </seg>
<seg id="263"> - You got to go? </seg>
<seg id="264"> Maybe another cup? Maybe another cigarette? </seg>
<seg id="265"> Boy, I'd like to. No. I really gotta go. I mean... </seg>
<seg id="266"> My wife, she's alone in a motel. </seg>
<seg id="267"> Maybe we could call her up, come on down here. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Have a cup of coffee and a couple of cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="269"> She doesn't smoke. You know, it's the willpower. </seg>
<seg id="270"> - I see. - I don't want to start her. </seg>
<seg id="271"> No, you don't want to get her started. </seg>
<seg id="272"> - This is our little thing here. - Yeah, right. </seg>
<seg id="273"> But we can just sort of... We can just keep zipping along, you know. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I'll be thinking of you. </seg>
<seg id="275"> - Gotta go. - I guess so. </seg>
<seg id="276"> - See you soon. - Yeah, okay. </seg>
<seg id="277"> I wish you could stay a little longer. </seg>
<seg id="278"> - We were just starting to get going here. - Gotta go. </seg>
<seg id="279"> Okay, Jim. </seg>
<seg id="280"> - Next time. - Okay, next time. </seg>
<seg id="281"> - You take care. - You take care, too. </seg>
<seg id="282"> He's not on here, either. </seg>
<seg id="283"> - You're a fucking moron, you know that? - Now what? </seg>
<seg id="284"> I can't believe that you're still smoking those fucking things. </seg>
<seg id="285"> Vinny, they'll fuck you up. They'll kill you. Believe me. </seg>
<seg id="286"> Were you put on this fucking earth to annoy me? </seg>
<seg id="287"> You said you were gonna quit. Instead, you spend a fortune. </seg>
<seg id="288"> So those big tobacco companies can get fucking rich. And then you get cancer. </seg>
<seg id="289"> And then the fucking doctors and the hospitals, they can get rich. </seg>
<seg id="290"> And the undertakers, too. </seg>
<seg id="291"> All because you want to smoke like a fucking moron. </seg>
<seg id="292"> I can't help it. I'm fucking addicted, okay? </seg>
<seg id="293"> So, coffee and cigarettes? </seg>
<seg id="294"> That's your lunch? That ain't healthy, is it? </seg>
<seg id="295"> You're drinking coffee so don't break my fuckin' balls. </seg>
<seg id="296"> Vinny, I had lunch already. </seg>
<seg id="297"> So I'm on a diet, okay? Jesus! </seg>
<seg id="298"> Here comes my freaking kid. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Do me a favor. Don't tell your mother, please. </seg>
<seg id="300"> What the fuck am I talking about? She smokes like a locomotive, anyway. </seg>
<seg id="301"> How you doing, Junior? </seg>
<seg id="302"> - He don't talk much, does he? - Not lately. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Lately he's been the silent type. </seg>
<seg id="304"> I gave you $10 last night. So what did you do with it? </seg>
<seg id="305"> I just gave you $5. </seg>
<seg id="306"> Listen, I'll give you $1 more. That's it. </seg>
<seg id="307"> Can I at least get a hug? For $6, can I get a freaking hug? </seg>
<seg id="308"> $10 for a hug? You gotta be out of your freaking mind. All right, come here. I'll give you. </seg>
<seg id="309"> You better go get yourself something to eat, and something good. </seg>
<seg id="310"> Yeah, just like him. Get some coffee and cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="311"> Oh, brother! What the fuck are you talking about? </seg>
<seg id="312"> Look how much coffee you're drinking. </seg>
<seg id="313"> You got the whole fucking pot over there with you. </seg>
<seg id="314"> So what? They always bring me a whole pot. </seg>
<seg id="315"> I like coffee. Keeps me going. </seg>
<seg id="316"> It keeps you going, all right. You're a fucking maniac. A caffeine maniac. </seg>
<seg id="317"> - You're drinking coffee, ain't you? - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="318"> - So? </seg>
<seg id="319"> - So maybe you should try to quit. </seg>
<seg id="320"> - I ain't no fucking quitter. - I'll drink to that. </seg>
<seg id="321"> Fucking moron. Shit, here comes my kid again. </seg>
<seg id="322"> How much did you spend? </seg>
<seg id="323"> And that's all you got for $4? Peas and something to drink for $4? </seg>
<seg id="324"> - What the heck is in that bag? - It's those Chinese peas. </seg>
<seg id="325"> They're not? </seg>
<seg id="326"> They're Japanese? </seg>
<seg id="327"> Chinese, Japanese. Same thing. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Try one. </seg>
<seg id="329"> Jesus Christ! Tastes like black pepper. </seg>
<seg id="330"> Give me those. </seg>
<seg id="331"> Little bastard. Did you see that? He tried to fucking poison me. </seg>
<seg id="332"> No, he didn't, Joe. Listen to me. Those things are very expensive. </seg>
<seg id="333"> They're like a delicacy. A refined taste. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Refined taste, my ass. </seg>
<seg id="335"> Jesus Christ, not again. </seg>
<seg id="336"> I can't even light a fucking cigarette around here without getting busted. </seg>
<seg id="337"> You know something? You really are a fucking moron. </seg>
<seg id="338"> I'm gonna get to those big tobacco companies... and I'm gonna thank them when they put you in the fucking ground. </seg>
<seg id="339"> And did I ever tell that you're like a fucking wife that I don't need? </seg>
<seg id="340"> Can't fucking enjoy a cigarette. </seg>
<seg id="341"> Excuse me, miss. Can I get you some more coffee? </seg>
<seg id="342"> I really wish you hadn't done that. </seg>
<seg id="343"> I had it the right color, the right temperature. It was just right. </seg>
<seg id="344"> Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Hi. </seg>
<seg id="346"> Sorry. Sorry about the coffee. </seg>
<seg id="347"> - Does your name happen to be Gloria? - No. </seg>
<seg id="348"> 'Cause I thought maybe you... You're not friends with... </seg>
<seg id="349"> Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="350"> So can I get you something else? </seg>
<seg id="351"> A sandwich? Something to eat along with your coffee? </seg>
<seg id="352"> It's not a very healthy lunch, just the coffee and cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="353"> It's not my lunch, okay? </seg>
<seg id="354"> Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="355"> Alex. </seg>
<seg id="356"> You startled me. </seg>
<seg id="357"> How are you, Isaach? </seg>
<seg id="358"> Okay? Very well. </seg>
<seg id="359"> I'm happy to see you. </seg>
<seg id="360"> I was so sick of being in Paris. You can't imagine. </seg>
<seg id="361"> Sit down. </seg>
<seg id="362"> So, I was happy to get your call. </seg>
<seg id="363"> So long time we didn't see each other. </seg>
<seg id="364"> - I ordered you some coffee, okay? - Yeah, sure. Thanks. </seg>
<seg id="365"> So, everything is okay? </seg>
<seg id="366"> Everything is okay. Very good. </seg>
<seg id="367"> I am fine. </seg>
<seg id="368"> So, are you sure that everything is okay with you? </seg>
<seg id="369"> Everything is okay. </seg>
<seg id="370"> And you? </seg>
<seg id="371"> Me? Things are okay. </seg>
<seg id="372"> Not perfect, you know, but pretty much okay. </seg>
<seg id="373"> Good. I'm very happy to see you. </seg>
<seg id="374"> I'm happy to see you, man. </seg>
<seg id="375"> It's just that since I didn't see you for so long... </seg>
<seg id="376"> and you called to say you wanted to see me, I thought maybe something was wrong. </seg>
<seg id="377"> No. I just wanted to see you, that's all. </seg>
<seg id="378"> Me too, man. I wanted to see you too. </seg>
<seg id="379"> Are you sure there's nothing you want to tell me? - Nothing bothering you? </seg>
<seg id="380"> - But why? </seg>
<seg id="381"> - Do you want something to be wrong? - Not at all. </seg>
<seg id="382"> When I got your call, I had an intuition that something was bothering you. </seg>
<seg id="383"> Something maybe you need to talk about. That's all, man. </seg>
<seg id="384"> Isaach, there is nothing wrong. Really. </seg>
<seg id="385"> Okay? </seg>
<seg id="386"> Are you sure? </seg>
<seg id="387"> Are you crazy, Isaach? </seg>
<seg id="388"> Are you sure you have nothing... </seg>
<seg id="389"> you know, to let out? </seg>
<seg id="390"> Should I invent something bad? I could invent something bad for you. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Not at all. No. I don't want you to invent something. </seg>
<seg id="392"> You know, I'm your best friend. </seg>
<seg id="393"> You should feel completely free to tell me the truth. </seg>
<seg id="394"> To tell me whatever is bothering you. </seg>
<seg id="395"> Cut the shit. </seg>
<seg id="396"> Okay, I understand. That's cool. </seg>
<seg id="397"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="398"> No problem. </seg>
<seg id="399"> Isaach, no problem. </seg>
<seg id="400"> I guess I'm gonna go. </seg>
<seg id="401"> Really? So soon? </seg>
<seg id="402"> Yeah, you know, man... if you don't want to talk to me about it, I don't want to be a problem. </seg>
<seg id="403"> There is no problem, Isaach. Don't you understand? No problem. </seg>
<seg id="404"> I understand. But listen... </seg>
<seg id="405"> if you don't want to talk now, call me anytime, okay? </seg>
<seg id="406"> Now maybe it's not the right time for you, that's all. </seg>
<seg id="407"> So, I was very happy to see you. </seg>
<seg id="408"> Yes, me too. </seg>
<seg id="409"> I'm sorry to disappoint you, but there is nothing wrong. Really. </seg>
<seg id="410"> It's okay. </seg>
<seg id="411"> I do understand. </seg>
<seg id="412"> No. You don't understand. </seg>
<seg id="413"> Call me. </seg>
<seg id="414"> See you, Isaach. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Soon. </seg>
<seg id="416"> - Hi, so nice to see you. - You too. </seg>
<seg id="417"> It's been ages. </seg>
<seg id="418"> Last time, what? A couple of years ago in Sydney, wasn't it? </seg>
<seg id="419"> Really, was that two years ago? </seg>
<seg id="420"> How are Jeff and Beryl? </seg>
<seg id="421"> You know, same old, same old. </seg>
<seg id="422"> Still stuck in their odd little parental ways. </seg>
<seg id="423"> So you're not with Mr. Cate and the baby on this trip? </seg>
<seg id="424"> No. Unfortunately, I'm by myself. I'll see them next week. </seg>
<seg id="425"> Everyone's good? Yeah, I want a baby. At some point. </seg>
<seg id="426"> - What can I get for you? - What are you having, Catie? </seg>
<seg id="427"> Can I have an espresso, please? In a large cup? </seg>
<seg id="428"> Yeah, I'll have an espresso too, thanks. A double. </seg>
<seg id="429"> And can I have some hot milk on the side? And could you heat it? </seg>
<seg id="430"> - I think we can manage that. - Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="431"> I'm sorry I'm late. I know you haven't got a lot of time. </seg>
<seg id="432"> Don't worry about it. I just wish I could stay here longer. </seg>
<seg id="433"> Do you stay here overnight, or do you just do your press stuff here? Your junket. </seg>
<seg id="434"> No, I stay overnight and I do the interviews here too. </seg>
<seg id="435"> I just think it's easier. They do the interviews in my suite upstairs. </seg>
<seg id="436"> They're setting up for the next interview... and I just thought maybe it would be nicer if we met down here. </seg>
<seg id="437"> No, thanks, Shell. You're not... </seg>
<seg id="438"> Go on. They're not going to stop you smoking. </seg>
<seg id="439"> - There you go, cous'. - Thanks. </seg>
<seg id="440"> So you mean they give you this full-on hotel suite... and they also use it for your publicity? </seg>
<seg id="441"> Seems kind of cheap. </seg>
<seg id="442"> Well, it's a suite. So they just divide up the room. </seg>
<seg id="443"> Yeah, but why couldn't they get you a suite... and get another suite to do your press in? </seg>
<seg id="444"> It's pretty low-budget, this thing I did. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Yeah, still. </seg>
<seg id="446"> It's pretty cheap, man. </seg>
<seg id="447"> Can I get you anything else? </seg>
<seg id="448"> - No, thanks. That's great. - You're welcome. </seg>
<seg id="449"> Kind of weird getting in here. I almost didn't... until they found out I was your cousin. </seg>
<seg id="450"> There're some photographer, paparazzi guys hanging out front. </seg>
<seg id="451"> I guess they kind of follow you around, right? </seg>
<seg id="452"> You know, whatever so-called celebrities are around, I suppose. </seg>
<seg id="453"> God, that must be a real fucking drag sometimes, right? </seg>
<seg id="454"> I mean, not like me. I'm free. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Practically broke, but I'm completely free. </seg>
<seg id="456"> No one's stalking me, that's for fucking sure. </seg>
<seg id="457"> Except when they thought I was you. </seg>
<seg id="458"> I got into this club once because they thought I was you. </seg>
<seg id="459"> Then they found out I wasn't and asked me to leave. </seg>
<seg id="460"> Pretty fucking rude. </seg>
<seg id="461"> Don't get me wrong. I mean, it must be fabulous. You got it all. </seg>
<seg id="462"> You got a good husband, beautiful baby. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Travel all over the world, stay in fancy hotels. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Parties... </seg>
<seg id="465"> You know what they say, the grass is always greener. </seg>
<seg id="466"> So, how's... </seg>
<seg id="467"> Shit. </seg>
<seg id="468"> - Johnny. - Who? </seg>
<seg id="469"> Jimmy. Tommy. Sorry. How is he? </seg>
<seg id="470"> We broke up almost two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Tommy, yeah. What a dickhead. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Got a new boyfriend now. Lee. Remember? </seg>
<seg id="473"> He's in a band. Wrote you about him. </seg>
<seg id="474"> He's a pretty huge part of my life. </seg>
<seg id="475"> Sorry, Shell, I don't think you did. </seg>
<seg id="476"> Yeah, I even sent you his fucking CD. </seg>
<seg id="477"> Your assistant probably didn't give it to you. </seg>
<seg id="478"> It's okay. It's totally cool. I mean, I know how busy your life is. </seg>
<seg id="479"> - Do you remember where you sent it? - No. I mean, one week you're in LA... </seg>
<seg id="480"> then you're in London, then you're in Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="481"> I mean, you're in a different fucking city every day of the week. </seg>
<seg id="482"> I'd love to hear the music. What does it sound like? </seg>
<seg id="483"> It's really... </seg>
<seg id="484"> kind of hard... </seg>
<seg id="485"> and it's industrial, kind of throbbing... </seg>
<seg id="486"> I don't think you'd get it. </seg>
<seg id="487"> - What are they called? - They're called Sqürl. </seg>
<seg id="488"> Squirrel. </seg>
<seg id="489"> No, Sqürl. You know, like they say it here. </seg>
<seg id="490"> S-Q-U-R-L, with an umlaut over the "U". Sqürl. </seg>
<seg id="491"> Sqürl. I get it. Right. </seg>
<seg id="492"> So can I buy the CD until I find the one you sent? </seg>
<seg id="493"> No, not yet. They recorded it independently, you know, so... </seg>
<seg id="494"> But I think the record company's gonna put it out finally. </seg>
<seg id="495"> I think. </seg>
<seg id="496"> I'm gonna have to find that CD so I can listen to it. </seg>
<seg id="497"> You're not gonna find it. </seg>
<seg id="498"> Shell, that isn't fair, actually. </seg>
<seg id="499"> - It's true. You're not gonna find it. - Really? </seg>
<seg id="500"> I fucking know you're not. 'Cause I just remembered... I didn't actually send it to you. </seg>
<seg id="501"> I think I just thought about sending it to you. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Almost forgot. This is for you. </seg>
<seg id="503"> Thanks. What is it? </seg>
<seg id="504"> This is really expensive stuff. It must have cost hundreds. </seg>
<seg id="505"> Cool, thanks. I could use this stuff. </seg>
<seg id="506"> Make me look like a movie star, right? </seg>
<seg id="507"> - Cheers. - Cheers, gorgeous. </seg>
<seg id="508"> Seriously, Catie, thanks for seeing me. </seg>
<seg id="509"> No, thanks for seeing me. </seg>
<seg id="510"> And thanks for all the fancy swag. </seg>
<seg id="511"> It's nothing. </seg>
<seg id="512"> It is swag, isn't it? </seg>
<seg id="513"> They probably give you all kinds of free stuff... jewelry, clothes. Probably give you cars, right? </seg>
<seg id="514"> No, they don't give me cars. They sometimes give me makeup, from time to time. But I just thought... I don't know, I just wanted... </seg>
<seg id="515"> Didn't have time to go shopping. </seg>
<seg id="516"> No, really, it's fine. I mean, it's great. I can use it. </seg>
<seg id="517"> It's just funny, don't you think? When you can't afford something, it's really expensive. </seg>
<seg id="518"> And then when you can afford it, it's free. </seg>
<seg id="519"> Kind of backward, don't you think? </seg>
<seg id="520"> The world's a bit like that, I guess, in a lot of ways. </seg>
<seg id="521"> Speaking of paparazzi... </seg>
<seg id="522"> I saw these photos of you the other day in the tabloids. </seg>
<seg id="523"> Don't tell me that. Yuck. </seg>
<seg id="524"> What was I wearing? </seg>
<seg id="525"> Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="526"> Hello? Hi, Lindsey. </seg>
<seg id="527"> I'm downstairs, in the coffee room with my cousin Shelly. </seg>
<seg id="528"> It's already... </seg>
<seg id="529"> Okay, yeah. I'll be up in a minute. Bye. </seg>
<seg id="530"> - Got to get back to work? - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="531"> Back to the grind? </seg>
<seg id="532"> Do you want to come up to the room? </seg>
<seg id="533"> It won't be very interesting, but you're welcome to come up. </seg>
<seg id="534"> What, and watch you do TV interviews and stuff? </seg>
<seg id="535"> Like Entertainment Tonight? </seg>
<seg id="536"> Maybe you can send me that CD, or a letter, or something. </seg>
<seg id="537"> - Yeah, but you wouldn't read it. - Stop it. I would if you actually sent it. </seg>
<seg id="538"> I've really gotta go. Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="539"> It was great seeing you. Have you got my numbers? </seg>
<seg id="540"> Take care. Send my love to everyone. </seg>
<seg id="541"> Yeah, send my love to everyone on your end. </seg>
<seg id="542"> If they even remember me. </seg>
<seg id="543"> - Bye, Catie. - See you, Shell. </seg>
<seg id="544"> Put that on my room and anything else she wants. </seg>
<seg id="545"> - Maybe next time I'll get to meet Lou. - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="546"> It's Lee. </seg>
<seg id="547"> Excuse me. </seg>
<seg id="548"> Can I have a tequila? Thanks, a double, and the menu. </seg>
<seg id="549"> I'm sorry, there's no smoking in the lounge. </seg>
<seg id="550"> So, Jack, you going to tell me about your tesla coil? </seg>
<seg id="551"> You said you didn't want to hear about it. </seg>
<seg id="552"> Yeah, but that was a while ago. </seg>
<seg id="553"> I don't know if I want to talk about it. </seg>
<seg id="554"> Come on, Jack. You dragged it all the way down here in your little red wagon. </seg>
<seg id="555"> Come on, just tell me about it. </seg>
<seg id="556"> I built it based on the inventor Nikola Tesla's original designs. </seg>
<seg id="557"> It's an air transformer... with primary and secondary coils that are tuned to resonate. </seg>
<seg id="558"> It's basically a step-up transformer... which converts relatively low-voltage high current to high-voltage low current... at high frequencies. </seg>
<seg id="559"> Do you remember... when we were kids, you had a little Barbie makeup mirror? </seg>
<seg id="560"> Yeah, I remember that. </seg>
<seg id="561"> It had a little fluorescent light on it? </seg>
<seg id="562"> Nikola Tesla invented fluorescent light. </seg>
<seg id="563"> Without him, we wouldn't have alternating current... radio, television, x-ray technology... induction motors, particle beams, lasers. </seg>
<seg id="564"> None of that would even exist, if it weren't for him. </seg>
<seg id="565"> Or the rock band, Tesla. </seg>
<seg id="566"> Funny. </seg>
<seg id="567"> Tesla was a true genius. </seg>
<seg id="568"> If we had paid more attention to his ideas, the world would be a much better place. We'd have free mass communication, free transportation... free energy for everyone. </seg>
<seg id="569"> That's why they discredited him in the end. For free energy. </seg>
<seg id="570"> He perceived the Earth as a conductor of acoustical resonance. </seg>
<seg id="571"> What a beautiful idea. </seg>
<seg id="572"> So, Jack, are you going to show me how the coil works? </seg>
<seg id="573"> Yeah, all right. </seg>
<seg id="574"> You'll need these. </seg>
<seg id="575"> - All right, you ready, Meg? - I'm ready. </seg>
<seg id="576"> Damn it. Something went wrong. </seg>
<seg id="577"> It was cool, though. </seg>
<seg id="578"> Yeah, but it wasn't supposed to stop. It was supposed to keep working. I don't know what happened. </seg>
<seg id="579"> I think maybe you blew a capacitor? </seg>
<seg id="580"> No, I didn't blow a capacitor, Meg. </seg>
<seg id="581"> Maybe it tripped your GFI. </seg>
<seg id="582"> Yeah, your Ground Fault Interrupter. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Yeah, I know what a GFI is. That's not what happened. </seg>
<seg id="584"> You don't have to snap at me. </seg>
<seg id="585"> I think maybe the spark gaps are too far apart on your spark coil vibrator. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Yeah, that could be it. </seg>
<seg id="587"> I guess. </seg>
<seg id="588"> Yeah, it is. That's it. </seg>
<seg id="589"> You're right about that. I didn't check that earlier. </seg>
<seg id="590"> I'm gonna go home and check it out. </seg>
<seg id="591"> - Are you going to go bowling tomorrow? - Yeah, I'll be there. </seg>
<seg id="592"> All right, I'll see you there. </seg>
<seg id="593"> Earth as a conductor of acoustical resonance. </seg>
<seg id="594"> Hello, who is this? </seg>
<seg id="595"> Laura. Hi, this is Alfred Molina for Steve Coogan. </seg>
<seg id="596"> M-O-L-I-N-A. </seg>
<seg id="597"> The actor, yes. </seg>
<seg id="598"> I was just double-checking that Steve... </seg>
<seg id="599"> He is. Great, okay. </seg>
<seg id="600"> Just in case you need it, my cell phone number... </seg>
<seg id="601"> Hello? - Hello, Alfred. - Steve, hello. </seg>
<seg id="602"> Hi. I'm so glad you could make it. Please sit down. </seg>
<seg id="603"> I was just talking to Laura, your assistant, seeing if you were on your way here. </seg>
<seg id="604"> - I'm here. - Fantastic. </seg>
<seg id="605"> I took the liberty of ordering some tea. </seg>
<seg id="606"> Shall I be mother? </seg>
<seg id="607"> That's okay, I'll be my own mother. </seg>
<seg id="608"> Some milk there for you. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Real tea. </seg>
<seg id="610"> It's hard to come by. </seg>
<seg id="611"> I have this fantasy where if I ever won a Golden Globe or an Academy Award... </seg>
<seg id="612"> I'd use the opportunity to tell the Yanks how to make a decent cup of tea. </seg>
<seg id="613"> - Here's to a good cup of tea. - Cheers. </seg>
<seg id="614"> I love your coat. </seg>
<seg id="615"> Yeah, it's Viv Westwood. </seg>
<seg id="616"> I've got a weakness for British designers. </seg>
<seg id="617"> I don't know what it is about American designers. </seg>
<seg id="618"> They're just too safe. </seg>
<seg id="619"> Aren't you going to be a little bit warm? It's about 85 outside. </seg>
<seg id="620"> No, I take it off when I go out. </seg>
<seg id="621"> It's just the air conditioning. </seg>
<seg id="622"> - So how long have you been living in LA? - We've been here about seven years. </seg>
<seg id="623"> We love it here. </seg>
<seg id="624"> I do love visiting LA. </seg>
<seg id="625"> But I always say, it's a great place to visit, it's an even nicer place to leave. </seg>
<seg id="626"> The palm trees... Palm trees annoy the fuck out of me. </seg>
<seg id="627"> It's not for everybody. I like it here. </seg>
<seg id="628"> I came out here for the work and stuff. </seg>
<seg id="629"> It's great to finally meet you. </seg>
<seg id="630"> I've got to say I'm a huge fan of your stuff... </seg>
<seg id="631"> all the stuff you've done on TV, the comedy stuff. </seg>
<seg id="632"> I've got all the tapes. I get them sent over. It's fantastic. </seg>
<seg id="633"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="634"> Likewise, I'm certainly very aware of you. </seg>
<seg id="635"> Great. </seg>
<seg id="636"> I saw that TV series you did. </seg>
<seg id="637"> Yeah, you saw that? </seg>
<seg id="638"> Yeah. Interesting. </seg>
<seg id="639"> - We got canceled. - Yeah, I heard that. </seg>
<seg id="640"> Comedy's such a difficult thing. </seg>
<seg id="641"> Your career seems to be going terribly well. You've got a lot of heat at the moment. </seg>
<seg id="642"> Is that why you're here? </seg>
<seg id="643"> The merry-go-round of meetings. It's nice. </seg>
<seg id="644"> People are finally starting to take a bit of notice, which is great. </seg>
<seg id="645"> - Are you meeting on anything interesting? - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="646"> I've got to say you were just fantastic... in 24 Hour. No, seriously, </seg>
<seg id="647"> - I mean, brilliant. Great work. - Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="648"> Really brilliant. It was... </seg>
<seg id="649"> And the reviews... </seg>
<seg id="650"> They were pretty fucking great. </seg>
<seg id="651"> I was amazed because it was... I didn't think many people would get all the cultural references. </seg>
<seg id="652"> Sort of, Manchester, early '80s, the whole music scene. </seg>
<seg id="653"> You'd be surprised. </seg>
<seg id="654"> But a lot of people didn't have any kind of reference to make to it because... </seg>
<seg id="655"> They know about the bands over here... </seg>
<seg id="656"> but the whole thing, your character, and his running the TV show... </seg>
<seg id="657"> Do you want a cigarette? </seg>
<seg id="658"> - Sorry, they're French. - No, that's okay. Thanks. </seg>
<seg id="659"> I'll save it for later. </seg>
<seg id="660"> Okay. </seg>
<seg id="661"> So, Laura said that... you were really keen to meeting. She wouldn't tell me what it was. </seg>
<seg id="662"> I didn't want to say it over the phone because it would've sounded weird. </seg>
<seg id="663"> I can imagine how she thought. This was coming out of nowhere. </seg>
<seg id="664"> I phone her up, and she doesn't know me from Adam. I said, "I must talk to Steve Coogan". </seg>
<seg id="665"> But I wanted to see you in person. </seg>
<seg id="666"> When I found out you'd be here for a few days... </seg>
<seg id="667"> I thought this was the perfect opportunity to let you know... </seg>
<seg id="668"> Anyway, I'll get right to it. I'm so excited about this. </seg>
<seg id="669"> Let me try and put it in context. I've always had a big passion for history... and people's lives... and all the little events of how you get from A to B... </seg>
<seg id="670"> and all the small details in people's lives... that are kind of really full of epic qualities. </seg>
<seg id="671"> So I've been doing all this research and... </seg>
<seg id="672"> I've come up with this. </seg>
<seg id="673"> And what state is... Is it greenlit or is it just a treatment? What stage is it? </seg>
<seg id="674"> I'm sorry. God, it's so embarrassing. </seg>
<seg id="675"> It's not some... This isn't work. It's got nothing to do with work. It's not a project. </seg>
<seg id="676"> I did some genealogical research, and I came across... What I discovered was... </seg>
<seg id="677"> - Mr. Coogan? - Yes? </seg>
<seg id="678"> - It is you, isn't it? - It is, yes. </seg>
<seg id="679"> - I'm such a huge fan. - You're not that huge. Only where it counts. </seg>
<seg id="680"> - Could I bother you for an autograph? - Absolutely. - Great. </seg>
<seg id="681"> - I've been recognized. Where do you want it? </seg>
<seg id="682"> - Paper is fine. - Spoilsport. </seg>
<seg id="683"> - No, don't do that. - Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="684"> - I probably have something in my bag. - Okay. </seg>
<seg id="685"> Just give me a second here. </seg>
<seg id="686"> Oh, gosh. - I'm so sorry. - That's all right. </seg>
<seg id="687"> - Give me one more minute. - Take your time. </seg>
<seg id="688"> - Here, please, in there. - Okay, and what's your name? Katy. </seg>
<seg id="689"> - With a "Y". - All right. </seg>
<seg id="690"> What Katy did next. </seg>
<seg id="691"> - Hello. - Alfred's an actor too. </seg>
<seg id="692"> - Here. - Thank you. Great. </seg>
<seg id="693"> - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. </seg>
<seg id="694"> - Wow. - Let's get back to this. </seg>
<seg id="695"> I don't want to take up too much of your time. I know you're busy. </seg>
<seg id="696"> As I said, I did this genealogical research... </seg>
<seg id="697"> I was just doing it for my own interest. I wasn't looking for anything specific. I just came across this. </seg>
<seg id="698"> I'll cut a long story short. Steve Coogan. </seg>
<seg id="699"> Drum roll. </seg>
<seg id="700"> The thing is, Steve... </seg>
<seg id="701"> you and I are cousins. </seg>
<seg id="702"> How do you mean? You mean artistically? </seg>
<seg id="703"> No, I mean in the normal way. We're cousins. We're related. </seg>
<seg id="704"> - It's amazing, isn't it? - Yeah. Are you sure? </seg>
<seg id="705"> The way it works out is this, look... </seg>
<seg id="706"> My great-great grandfather... is your great-great uncle. </seg>
<seg id="707"> And further back, we shared the same great-great-great grandfather. </seg>
<seg id="708"> My ancestry is Irish, but I knew there was an Italian... </seg>
<seg id="709"> That's it. The Italian connection is... the great-great-great-great grandfather, Giuseppe. </seg>
<seg id="710"> - Isn't that amazing? - Yeah, this is... </seg>
<seg id="711"> This is a lot of detail. </seg>
<seg id="712"> - It's my thing, I kind of do a little... - Amazing. </seg>
<seg id="713"> I think it's just great to be able to say that I'm related to Steve Coogan. </seg>
<seg id="714"> Likewise, I can tell people I'm related to Albert Molina. </seg>
<seg id="715"> Alfred. </seg>
<seg id="716"> It's my grandmother who's the big one on the family tree. </seg>
<seg id="717"> She'll be very thrilled. She's a huge fan of your work. She loved you in... </seg>
<seg id="718"> Boogie Nights. </seg>
<seg id="719"> Right, with the shorts and the shotgun? </seg>
<seg id="720"> Yeah, she talked about that once. </seg>
<seg id="721"> Great. I know this is coming right out of the blue, but just think of the possibilities. </seg>
<seg id="722"> It's fantastic. Let's look at the facts. </seg>
<seg id="723"> We're both actors. We're cousins, we've established that. </seg>
<seg id="724"> We could maybe work together, do a play maybe. </seg>
<seg id="725"> We could make a movie. </seg>
<seg id="726"> We could actually do a movie about this story. </seg>
<seg id="727"> About discovering this amazing thing between us, that we're cousins. </seg>
<seg id="728"> We can actually play ourselves. </seg>
<seg id="729"> We'd be in the movie. I'd be Fred Molina, you'd be Steve... We'd be cousins in the movie. </seg>
<seg id="730"> It's fantastic. It'd be great, absolutely great. </seg>
<seg id="731"> You know, or not. We could just hang out. </seg>
<seg id="732"> We should definitely go for a beer sometime. That'd be great. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Maybe go on vacation together, just the two of us... sort of get to know each other. </seg>
<seg id="734"> You're not gay are you? </seg>
<seg id="735"> No. No, I'm married. </seg>
<seg id="736"> So was James I. </seg>
<seg id="737"> Sorry. I don't know, that just popped into my head. </seg>
<seg id="738"> - Say it, get it out of the way. - I understand. </seg>
<seg id="739"> I know exactly what you're thinking. </seg>
<seg id="740"> If somebody came up to me going, I'm your cousin... </seg>
<seg id="741"> I'd think they were a nutter as well. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Take it from me, I'm not crazy. I just think this is a fantastic, extraordinary... </seg>
<seg id="743"> - Delightful thing for me. - Absolutely. </seg>
<seg id="744"> - And I just wanted you to know about it. - Ditto. </seg>
<seg id="745"> All I want, if I want anything... is for you to just acknowledge this extraordinary thing... and just love me. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Yeah, I could do that. </seg>
<seg id="747"> I have to go. </seg>
<seg id="748"> I didn't tell you. I have this meeting. - It actually moved forward. - I see. </seg>
<seg id="749"> It's at Universal. Number crunchers, financiers... </seg>
<seg id="750"> - This... - That's for you. - That's great. - It's yours. </seg>
<seg id="751"> - I'll make sure that gets filed. - Sure. </seg>
<seg id="752"> You'll be here a couple of days, right? </seg>
<seg id="753"> So maybe we could see each other before you go. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Just checking the mental diary... </seg>
<seg id="755"> This is not good, the time I'm here. </seg>
<seg id="756"> - It's just that it's packed. - I understand. No problem. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Give me your cell phone number, and I'll call you before you go. </seg>
<seg id="758"> There's a story there. </seg>
<seg id="759"> There's a tri-band system here in the States... which is different to the system in the UK... and it's a kind of... </seg>
<seg id="760"> The cell phones, they don't work here. So I'm kind of cell phone-less... - in the US. - I see. Well, give me your home number. I'll call you. </seg>
<seg id="761"> - You've got my PA's number, right? - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="762"> Great, then we're connected. </seg>
<seg id="763"> Can't you give me your number at home? </seg>
<seg id="764"> Can I say no? Because nothing, absolutely nothing personal... </seg>
<seg id="765"> It's just that I never give my number out, ever. </seg>
<seg id="766"> It's just a personal space thing. </seg>
<seg id="767"> It's just a rule and I always think, stick to the rule. </seg>
<seg id="768"> It's more of a philosophy than a rule. </seg>
<seg id="769"> I've not given my number out to many eminent people in the past. </seg>
<seg id="770"> I once didn't give my number to Sam Mendes. So you're in good company. </seg>
<seg id="771"> If it's good enough for Sam Mendes, it's good enough for me. </seg>
<seg id="772"> - I think it's me. - Right, because mine doesn't work. </seg>
<seg id="773"> I'm sorry, I got to take this. I'll get back. </seg>
<seg id="774"> Hello? </seg>
<seg id="775"> Yeah, sure. </seg>
<seg id="776"> Spike, hi. How you doing? </seg>
<seg id="777"> You got the message. </seg>
<seg id="778"> My agent just called you just to make sure we're all on the same page. </seg>
<seg id="779"> No, the producer credit is just so you and I can sort of keep tabs on everything. You know, artistic integrity, that sort of thing. </seg>
<seg id="780"> Otherwise the whole thing could just run away. </seg>
<seg id="781"> You bastard, no. </seg>
<seg id="782"> All right. </seg>
<seg id="783"> You still okay for Sunday? Good. All right. </seg>
<seg id="784"> Will I meet you there? All right. Nice and early. Okay, yeah. Lots of love. Bye, Spike. </seg>
<seg id="785"> - I'm sorry about that. - It's okay, fine. </seg>
<seg id="786"> Was that Spike Lee? </seg>
<seg id="787"> No. I don't even know Spike Lee. That was Spike Jonze. </seg>
<seg id="788"> - I love him. - Yeah, he's a good man. </seg>
<seg id="789"> We've been friends for a long time now. </seg>
<seg id="790"> We're both keen hikers. - Well, it's very boring. - No, go on. </seg>
<seg id="791"> We belong to a club, and we go hiking at weekends. </seg>
<seg id="792"> He's a very committed environmentalist. </seg>
<seg id="793"> Spike Jonze is a tree-hugger. Jesus, I never had him down as that. </seg>
<seg id="794"> I think he prefers the term "leaf people"... as do I. </seg>
<seg id="795"> Right, I mean, that's... Don't get me wrong. That's great. I love trees. </seg>
<seg id="796"> I think there should be more of them. When I use paper, I use both sides. </seg>
<seg id="797"> I would love to... You know, I'm going to tear up... that stupid rule about phone numbers. It's such shit. </seg>
<seg id="798"> Would it be shabby of me to give you my number now? </seg>
<seg id="799"> Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="800"> I've got to go. I'm so sorry. </seg>
<seg id="801"> - I'll get the check. - Good. </seg>
<seg id="802"> Fuck. </seg>
<seg id="803"> Damn RZA. Where the fuck you at? </seg>
<seg id="804"> - Yo, peace. - Bobby. </seg>
<seg id="805"> - Pardon me for being late. - Ain't nothing. - I was about to hit you on the horn. - I had a fucking emergency house call, yo. </seg>
<seg id="806"> - A house call? - Yeah, a house call. </seg>
<seg id="807"> Sophia and Sifu's children got sick with the flu and the virus. </seg>
<seg id="808"> So I went by, prescribed some herbal medicines for them. </seg>
<seg id="809"> I told them, lay off the dairy products, chill on the citric acid... and they should feel a little better. </seg>
<seg id="810"> - So you a doctor now, or something? - Yeah, I told you. </seg>
<seg id="811"> I've been studying alternative medicine for two years now, son. </seg>
<seg id="812"> I mean, ancient healing techniques, and all that. </seg>
<seg id="813"> Check this. I even know a certain surgical procedure that I can perform using a drill-gun. </seg>
<seg id="814"> Electric drill-gun. I'm dead serious. </seg>
<seg id="815"> But my hands are nice from being a DJ, you know what I mean? </seg>
<seg id="816"> To me, music and medicine, all go together. </seg>
<seg id="817"> It's like two planets revolving around the same sun. </seg>
<seg id="818"> So bong-bong. - Want some tea? - Yeah, splash me. </seg>
<seg id="819"> It's all herbals, man. No caffeine. </seg>
<seg id="820"> That's what I'm talking about. No caffeine. Caffeine is ridiculous right now, man. </seg>
<seg id="821"> Tell me about it. Caffeine leads to depression... makes you all irritable, have your heart beating fast. </seg>
<seg id="822"> Faster heart rate, you know what I mean? </seg>
<seg id="823"> And worse than anything, you drink that coffee, it gives you the shits. </seg>
<seg id="824"> You know what I mean? So I try to stay away from that. </seg>
<seg id="825"> - I'm off that shit, anyway. - Crisp and clean. No caffeine. </seg>
<seg id="826"> - To Liquid Swords, family. - No, to Bobby Digital. </seg>
<seg id="827"> - Wu-Tang forever. - Wu-Tang forever. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Anybody need more coffee? </seg>
<seg id="829"> - Kitchen's closing. - No, we don't mess with caffeine. </seg>
<seg id="830"> - You don't? - No, I don't. </seg>
<seg id="831"> Don't you know caffeine can cause serious delirium? </seg>
<seg id="832"> - Delirium? - Serious delirium. </seg>
<seg id="833"> Now you tell me. Well, that may be my problem, delirium. </seg>
<seg id="834"> Aren't you Bill Murray, man? - You're Bill Murray? - Yeah, I'm Bill Murray... but let's keep that just between us, all right? Just between us. </seg>
<seg id="835"> And you guys are related? </seg>
<seg id="836"> Yeah, we're cousins. We're family. </seg>
<seg id="837"> No, you're messing with me because you're both troublemakers. </seg>
<seg id="838"> - Troublemakers? - The Wu-Tang Clan. </seg>
<seg id="839"> Right, Wu-Tang Clan. </seg>
<seg id="840"> - You're GZA, the genius. - That's right. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - And you're RZA... - A.k.a... </seg>
<seg id="842"> - Bobby Digital. - Yeah, he knows hip-hop. </seg>
<seg id="843"> And you're Bill Murray. </seg>
<seg id="844"> Bill "Groundhog-Day-Ghostbusting-Ass" Murray. </seg>
<seg id="845"> - Who ya gonna call? - I know that. Just don't tell anybody. </seg>
<seg id="846"> What you mean, don't tell anybody, Bill Murray? </seg>
<seg id="847"> People will come here, they'll see you. You're Bill Murray. It's obvious. </seg>
<seg id="848"> Unless you're wearing a disguise or something. </seg>
<seg id="849"> I am wearing kind of a disguise. </seg>
<seg id="850"> Damn, that's harsh, money. </seg>
<seg id="851"> - You're a real caffeine junkie, aren't you? - Keep it down. Just between us. Here, cheers. </seg>
<seg id="852"> You know, before I gave that up... I used to drink it every single night... up until it was time to go to sleep. Used to make me dream faster. </seg>
<seg id="853"> You know, like when they flash those cameras on those Indy 500 cars... and they just... </seg>
<seg id="854"> That's how my dreams were. Just whizzing by. </seg>
<seg id="855"> - You're stupid, yo. - He is stupid, isn't he? Word, yo. </seg>
<seg id="856"> I know a guy who freezes coffee. Puts sticks in it, has himself a coffee Popsicle. A caf pop. </seg>
<seg id="857"> Damn. That don't sound too good, Bill Murray. </seg>
<seg id="858"> It's not the flu or anything. It's just a smoker's cough. </seg>
<seg id="859"> That's what I'm saying, nicotine interferes with your central nervous system... your respiratorial system. </seg>
<seg id="860"> In very small doses, it causes paralysis. </seg>
<seg id="861"> - Really? - Yeah, really, man. </seg>
<seg id="862"> I mean, just 50mg alone... have been proven to be fatal in a few minutes. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - How much is in one cigarette? - 3mg. </seg>
<seg id="864"> And did you know they also use nicotine for insecticide... - to kill bugs? - It's good if it kills bugs, right? </seg>
<seg id="865"> Are you a bug, Bill Murray? </seg>
<seg id="866"> - Jesus, RZA, you sound like my doctor. - He is a doctor. </seg>
<seg id="867"> Actually, he specializes in alternative medicine. </seg>
<seg id="868"> That is, alternative to this planet. </seg>
<seg id="869"> Do me a favor and don't tell anybody you saw me here, okay? </seg>
<seg id="870"> You can trust us, Bill Murray. - You hiding out or something? - Yeah, sort of, something like that. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Now I'm thinking it may be delirium. </seg>
<seg id="872"> - Serious delirium. - Serious. </seg>
<seg id="873"> If you're on the low, I got something that'll help you with your disguise. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Take this. </seg>
<seg id="875"> - Use whatever you want. - Jeez. </seg>
<seg id="876"> - Rock that, man. Stay on the low. - You didn't have to do this. This is great. </seg>
<seg id="877"> A bag of items for you, Bill. </seg>
<seg id="878"> - Thank you. - Don't worry about it. </seg>
<seg id="879"> I really appreciate this. </seg>
<seg id="880"> This is great. </seg>
<seg id="881"> Doc, what could I do for this cough? </seg>
<seg id="882"> I was just thinking about that. Check this out. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - You get some hydrogen peroxide. - We got that for cuts and stuff. </seg>
<seg id="884"> Take 50% hydrogen peroxide, 50% water. </seg>
<seg id="885"> You gargle with it. Do not swallow, you spit it out. </seg>
<seg id="886"> Don't swallow, Bill Murray. </seg>
<seg id="887"> And if that doesn't work, try oven cleaner. </seg>
<seg id="888"> I got that in the back, too. </seg>
<seg id="889"> - Thank you. - Cool. </seg>
<seg id="890"> Thank you. I'm going to try it right now. </seg>
<seg id="891"> - Word. - Word, man. </seg>
<seg id="892"> - Bill motherfucking Murray. - It's crazy, yo. </seg>
<seg id="893"> - 3:00. - What's up? </seg>
<seg id="894"> I told Ghost to be here by 3:00 a.m. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Don't hold your breath on that. You know how it is waiting on Ghost. </seg>
<seg id="896"> - We'll be here all night. - Think we can smoke a blunt up here? </seg>
<seg id="897"> - It's hot up in here with the 5-0. - But we used to always smoke weed in here. </seg>
<seg id="898"> That was until Dirt Dog done blew it up. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Told Deflon, "Never let Dirty inside this spot, man". </seg>
<seg id="900"> So what's up? What you want to do? </seg>
<seg id="901"> - Yo, let's slide to the 'udio. - Hit the 'udio, right. Play some chess? All right, then. </seg>
<seg id="902"> - Is that the bill for Murray? - He don't need no money, yo. </seg>
<seg id="903"> - Hit him, anyway. - Think I should tip him? </seg>
<seg id="904"> - You think he's using the oven cleaner? - Don't know, but let's get the fuck out. </seg>
<seg id="905"> Are you all right, Taylor? </seg>
<seg id="906"> - No, not really. - What's up? </seg>
<seg id="907"> I don't know. I feel so divorced from the world. </seg>
<seg id="908"> I've lost touch with the world. </seg>
<seg id="909"> Do you know that song by Mahler... </seg>
<seg id="910"> - I've Lost Track of the World? - No. </seg>
<seg id="911"> It's one of the most beautiful... and saddest songs ever written. </seg>
<seg id="912"> I can almost hear it now. </seg>
<seg id="913"> Can you hear it? </seg>
<seg id="914"> It's gone now. </seg>
<seg id="915"> - But did you hear it? - I think so. </seg>
<seg id="916"> It resonated right through the whole building. </seg>
<seg id="917"> - Where are we? - In the armory, Taylor. The armory, Taylor. </seg>
<seg id="918"> It sounds so heavy and ponderous. </seg>
<seg id="919"> The armory. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Nikola Tesla... </seg>
<seg id="921"> perceived the Earth as a conductor... of acoustical resonance. </seg>
<seg id="922"> I have no idea what you're talking about. </seg>
<seg id="923"> Can you explain it to me? </seg>
<seg id="924"> - No, not really. - I know. Let's pretend this coffee is champagne. </seg>
<seg id="925"> Why would we do that? </seg>
<seg id="926"> Well, to celebrate life. </seg>
<seg id="927"> You know, like the rich, elegant people do. </seg>
<seg id="928"> The classy people. </seg>
<seg id="929"> I prefer coffee. Simple, working man's coffee. </seg>
<seg id="930"> You're so provincial, Bill. Do you know what your problem is? </seg>
<seg id="931"> What? </seg>
<seg id="932"> You have no joie de vivre. </seg>
<seg id="933"> I don't? </seg>
<seg id="934"> No, besides, this coffee is awful. </seg>
<seg id="935"> - You're right. It really is bad, isn't it? - Dreadful. </seg>
<seg id="936"> I propose a toast. </seg>
<seg id="937"> So what should we toast? </seg>
<seg id="938"> Paris in the 1920s. </seg>
<seg id="939"> Josephine Baker, the Moulin Rouge. </seg>
<seg id="940"> What is it? Okay? And also... </seg>
<seg id="941"> New York in the '70s. In the late '70s. </seg>
<seg id="942"> Really? All right. </seg>
<seg id="943"> Cheers. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Delicious, isn't it? </seg>
<seg id="945"> Champagne, nectar of the gods. </seg>
<seg id="946"> Is that all you're having for lunch, coffee and a cigarette? </seg>
<seg id="947"> It's not very healthy. </seg>
<seg id="948"> We had lunch earlier. We did? </seg>
<seg id="949"> We're on a break here, a coffee break. </seg>
<seg id="950"> How depressing. </seg>
<seg id="951"> How long is our break, anyway? </seg>
<seg id="952"> About 10 minutes, and it's nearly over now. </seg>
<seg id="953"> Say it isn't true. </seg>
<seg id="954"> - Well? - What? </seg>
<seg id="955"> I asked you to say it isn't true. </seg>
<seg id="956"> Say what isn't true? </seg>
<seg id="957"> Never mind. </seg>
<seg id="958"> Anyway, I have to have a nap. </seg>
<seg id="959"> So call me when the break is over. </seg>
<seg id="960"> Well, you have two minutes or less for your nap. </seg>
