<i>At last the glittering...</i>

2
00:00:07,176 --> 00:00:10,545
<i>... Queen of Night...</i>

3
00:00:11,055 --> 00:00:14,673
<i>... with black caress...</i>

4
00:00:14,892 --> 00:00:16,802
<i>... kills off...</i>

5
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:21,398
<i>... kills off the day.</i>

6
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,477
Mr. Chandos was a man
who spent more time...

7
00:00:25,694 --> 00:00:27,568
...with his gardener
than with his wife.

8
00:00:28,864 --> 00:00:30,109
They discussed plum trees...

9
00:00:30,824 --> 00:00:31,903
...ad nauseam.

10
00:00:34,411 --> 00:00:36,902
He gave his family and his
tenants cause to dread September...

11
00:00:37,122 --> 00:00:39,993
...for they were regaled with
plums until their guts rumbled like...

12
00:00:40,209 --> 00:00:42,367
...thunder and their backsides
ached from over-use.

13
00:00:44,046 --> 00:00:45,671
He built the chapel at Fovant...

14
00:00:45,923 --> 00:00:47,666
...where the pew
seats were of plumwood...

15
00:00:47,925 --> 00:00:50,167
...so the tenants still have cause
to remember Chandos...

16
00:00:50,386 --> 00:00:51,666
...through their backsides...

17
00:00:51,887 --> 00:00:53,512
...on account of the splinters.

18
00:00:54,515 --> 00:00:58,216
<i>At last the glittering...</i>

19
00:00:58,436 --> 00:01:02,018
<i>... Queen of Night...</i>

20
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,146
<i>... with black caress...</i>

21
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:08,317
<i>... kills off...</i>

22
00:01:08,779 --> 00:01:12,859
<i>... kills off the day.</i>

23
00:01:13,325 --> 00:01:16,575
Some years ago two gentlemen
went back to Amsterdam...

24
00:01:16,787 --> 00:01:19,360
...saying that Allhevinghay
was just like home.

25
00:01:19,665 --> 00:01:21,325
There was so much water...

26
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,206
...so many ornamental ponds,
so many canals...

27
00:01:24,419 --> 00:01:26,246
...so many sinks and basins.

28
00:01:26,922 --> 00:01:28,416
There was even a wind pump.

29
00:01:29,216 --> 00:01:31,256
What they had not realised was...

30
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:34,636
...my father had made
his land into a pattern...

31
00:01:34,847 --> 00:01:36,008
...of reservoirs...

32
00:01:36,222 --> 00:01:39,093
...because he was terrified of fire.

33
00:01:39,434 --> 00:01:41,805
There was even a room
under the front stairs...

34
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,433
...that housed two hundred buckets...

35
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,770
...all of them filled with water.

36
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:50,358
I know because
whenever I was taken short...

37
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:53,446
...my brothers and I used
to rush in there and use them.

38
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:59,904
Those buckets were
filled before my mother died.

39
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,363
I expect them to be still there...

40
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:06,413
...with the same water of thirty years
ago I shouldn't wonder...

41
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,416
...mixed with a
little of myself, of course.

42
00:02:10,298 --> 00:02:12,006
I used to pee like a horse.

43
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,130
I still do.

44
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:19,467
<i>For those that walk...</i>

45
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,256
<i>... that walk...</i>

46
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:26,266
<i>... with hopeful step...</i>

47
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,981
<i>... in garden...</i>

48
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,475
<i>... in garden...</i>

49
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:35,233
<i>... in garden...</i>

50
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:38,021
<i>... love to find.</i>

51
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:40,991
At Southampton there's
a house I've admired...

52
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:43,112
...because from the
side it looks so flat.

53
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,872
It is of white Portland stone...

54
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,541
...and on a cloudy
day it looks as though...

55
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,245
...it might be attached to the sky.

56
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,623
Especially in the evening.

57
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,913
Its owner is a Miss Anterim.

58
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:53,755
She is a lady without a husband.

59
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:55,591
From the side Miss Anterim is also...

60
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,130
...a lady without significance.

61
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,003
Maybe that is why unlike her house...

62
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,763
...the lady is unattached.

63
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,137
What with one flatness
and another, Mr. Neville...

64
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,307
...as a painter
and as a draughtsman...

65
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,178
...you could be entertained.

66
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,804
Especially in the evening...

67
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,103
...from the side.

68
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:15,065
<i>For those that walk...</i>

69
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,854
<i>... that walk.</i>

70
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:21,781
It is said that the Duc de
Courey invited his water mechanic...

71
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,235
...to the top of an elaborate
cascade he had built...

72
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,455
...and asked him if he could
build such a marvel for anyone else.

73
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,835
The man, after offering
various thanks and pleasantries...

74
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:34,082
...admitted that with sufficient
patronage he probably could.

75
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,040
The Duc de Courey pushed him
gently in the small of the back...

76
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,840
...and the wretched man
plummeted to a watery death.

77
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:46,096
<i>Their hope to find success.</i>

78
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:50,344
<i>They're sure to make.</i>

79
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,809
Mr. Noyes...

80
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,724
...do you have a
ribald piece of gossip for me?

81
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,434
I am here to fulfill a role
as entertainer, so I am sure...

82
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,445
...that I could find
something for you.

83
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,984
Then you are here on merit.

84
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,857
A characteristic that the
company does not share...

85
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,948
...being here merely to express
confidence in one another's money.

86
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,444
You are one of the company.

87
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:12,492
My merititious conduct in
the company of Mr. Seymour...

88
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,253
...has been my invitation.

89
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,330
I am strictly not of the company...

90
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,172
...but a part of its property.

91
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,504
Since that's what the company is
here to discuss and to revel in...

92
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:23,755
...you should be well favoured.

93
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:27,263
I would well favour you myself
above two parterres and...

94
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,720
...drive of orange trees.

95
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:32,101
You are not extravagant in
your compliments, Mr. Noyes.

96
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,021
I'm not wealthy enough
to offer you more...

97
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,856
...but I intend to be so soon.

98
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,355
In the present company of 13...

99
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:38,849
...that owns a fair slice of England.

100
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,395
Two parterres and a drive of
orange trees is a beginning...

101
00:04:42,114 --> 00:04:45,234
...and being a lady
of the Italian fashion.

102
00:04:45,492 --> 00:04:47,319
You will appreciate
the value of oranges.

103
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,157
They smell so sweet.

104
00:04:49,621 --> 00:04:50,819
They are so invigorating.

105
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:55,242
<i>The very statues...</i>

106
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,710
<i>... breathe.</i>

107
00:05:00,548 --> 00:05:03,633
Do you think your father will ask Mr.
Neville to draw the house?

108
00:05:03,843 --> 00:05:07,841
Why not improve Mr. Neville's chances,
and yours, by inviting him yourself?

109
00:05:09,682 --> 00:05:11,889
That is a too imaginative
stratagem for me.

110
00:05:13,061 --> 00:05:15,433
Your father would find it
uncharacteristically bold.

111
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,058
Then you could surprise him...

112
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:20,224
...and perhaps surprise
Mr. Neville, as well.

113
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:22,526
And if that frightens you, mother...

114
00:05:22,737 --> 00:05:24,445
...we could lay the
blame on Mr. Neville.

115
00:05:24,656 --> 00:05:27,692
I hold the delight or despondency
of a man of property...

116
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:30,579
...by putting his house
in shadow or in sunlight.

117
00:05:31,371 --> 00:05:32,450
Even possibly...

118
00:05:32,913 --> 00:05:35,120
...I have some
control over the jealousy...

119
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,291
...or satisfaction of a husband...

120
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,496
...by depicting his wife...

121
00:05:40,213 --> 00:05:41,837
...dressed or undressed.

122
00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:45,130
Mrs. Clement asked
me if I had a wife...

123
00:05:45,593 --> 00:05:47,384
...which has a ring of impertinence.

124
00:05:47,595 --> 00:05:50,133
She knows I have a garden, how
doesn't she know I have a wife?

125
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,845
Perhaps because you
boast of one and not the other.

126
00:05:53,893 --> 00:05:56,467
But I suspect a sense of
modesty is an impertinence...

127
00:05:56,688 --> 00:05:58,146
...to such a lady as Mrs. Clement.

128
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:01,690
Your mother takes a sense of
modesty an unprecedented distance.

129
00:06:02,402 --> 00:06:05,237
Why doesn't she come out more?
She frets in the shadows.

130
00:06:05,447 --> 00:06:06,941
She does not fret, father...

131
00:06:07,157 --> 00:06:10,241
...or if she does you well
know the cause is your indifference.

132
00:06:11,577 --> 00:06:15,195
A house, a garden, a horse, a wife,
the preferential order.

133
00:06:15,414 --> 00:06:16,030
Nonsense!

134
00:06:16,248 --> 00:06:17,624
I am anxious, Mr. Neville...

135
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,498
...that you should
draw my husband's estate.

136
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:21,957
Why is that Madam?

137
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:27,709
My husband is a proud man delighted
to be associated with every brick...

138
00:06:28,135 --> 00:06:31,754
...and every tree of his property at
every moment of his waking life.

139
00:06:32,264 --> 00:06:33,510
No doubt in his dreams as well...

140
00:06:33,724 --> 00:06:36,298
...though I've not been
well acquainted with his dreams.

141
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:38,310
With such an excellent
relationship as...

142
00:06:38,521 --> 00:06:40,312
...your husband has
with his property...

143
00:06:40,523 --> 00:06:43,192
...he surely, having the
real thing, does not need a copy.

144
00:06:43,526 --> 00:06:46,099
I do not take well
to young men who preen.

145
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:48,237
Their vanity outweighs their prowess.

146
00:06:48,448 --> 00:06:50,273
Mr. Neville has prowess enough.

147
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:52,906
Enough to charm
where he cannot impress.

148
00:06:53,118 --> 00:06:55,953
He can charm and
impress the wives of rich men.

149
00:06:56,246 --> 00:06:58,239
That's not so uncommon, Mr. Seymour.

150
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,909
You come with me to
Southampton tomorrow.

151
00:07:02,127 --> 00:07:05,377
I'll show you how to impress
a lady with a good drawing on.

152
00:07:06,173 --> 00:07:08,082
My father's property, Mr. Neville...

153
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:10,418
...is a little more
forward than humble.

154
00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:13,554
Since humility in a building
is not antithetical to you...

155
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:16,641
...perhaps I can prevail on
you to draw my father's house?

156
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:20,890
The same proposition
from a different quarter.

157
00:07:21,105 --> 00:07:23,144
A concerted effort
naturally intrigues me...

158
00:07:23,357 --> 00:07:25,564
...but I feel things being
as they are.

159
00:07:25,776 --> 00:07:26,808
May I be bold.

160
00:07:27,194 --> 00:07:29,316
I do not think that
you or your mother...

161
00:07:29,863 --> 00:07:31,440
...could afford my services.

162
00:07:32,574 --> 00:07:34,152
Why not enjoy our patronage?

163
00:07:35,202 --> 00:07:37,111
Come and walk in Mr.
Herbert's garden tomorrow.

164
00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:38,159
Madam...

165
00:07:38,371 --> 00:07:39,949
...I cannot say that I
wouldn't be delighted...

166
00:07:40,165 --> 00:07:42,205
...but I fear,
despite your persistence...

167
00:07:42,626 --> 00:07:44,286
...that I have work
to do up and beyond...

168
00:07:44,503 --> 00:07:46,163
...this apple season
and will be in the service...

169
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,166
...of Lord Charborough
until next year's apples...

170
00:07:49,382 --> 00:07:51,006
...have all been drunk as cider.

171
00:07:55,721 --> 00:07:57,595
Your mother is excessively keen...

172
00:07:57,807 --> 00:07:59,550
...to have this house down on paper.

173
00:08:00,393 --> 00:08:02,302
Or perhaps it is you that is keen...

174
00:08:02,812 --> 00:08:04,639
...and your mother is
merely your surrogate?

175
00:08:05,106 --> 00:08:09,019
I admit, Mr. Neville, to being a
supplicant on my mother's behalf...

176
00:08:09,943 --> 00:08:12,730
...but she does not want it
for herself but for her husband.

177
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,066
The supplication then
has a long and diverse path.

178
00:08:16,825 --> 00:08:17,821
I am flattered.

179
00:08:19,286 --> 00:08:21,658
May not Mr. Herbert
himself do his own commissioning?

180
00:08:21,872 --> 00:08:23,450
The point of the exercise...

181
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,243
...is to avoid that one thing.

182
00:08:26,168 --> 00:08:27,497
You, Mr. Neville, are to be...

183
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:30,665
...the instrument of a
hopeful reconciliation.

184
00:08:31,298 --> 00:08:32,080
Mr. Neville...

185
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,095
...how can I persuade you to stay
with us at Compton Anstey?

186
00:08:37,304 --> 00:08:38,467
You cannot.

187
00:08:41,767 --> 00:08:43,475
But you can be bought, Mr. Neville.

188
00:08:44,437 --> 00:08:45,516
How much will it cost?

189
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,521
More than you can afford.

190
00:08:48,106 --> 00:08:50,680
But I must confess my
prime reason is indolence.

191
00:08:50,901 --> 00:08:51,932
I increase my price...

192
00:08:52,152 --> 00:08:54,228
...in proportion to my
expectation of pleasure.

193
00:08:54,446 --> 00:08:56,652
I do not expect great pleasure here.

194
00:09:09,294 --> 00:09:10,124
Madam...

195
00:09:11,463 --> 00:09:13,171
...I'm to leave in the morning
for Southampton.

196
00:09:13,549 --> 00:09:15,173
I've come to take my leave of you now.

197
00:09:17,428 --> 00:09:18,886
Do not order the hay to be cut.

198
00:09:19,847 --> 00:09:22,634
Do not leave the estate
and do not drink my claret.

199
00:09:24,268 --> 00:09:28,763
Don't expect me back until I'm ready,
which at the least will be 14 days.

200
00:09:30,148 --> 00:09:31,013
Good night, Madam.

201
00:09:31,983 --> 00:09:35,399
<i>She laughs...</i>

202
00:09:35,653 --> 00:09:36,685
I have decided...

203
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,986
...that it is most important
that you stay here...

204
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,821
...to make for me twelve
drawings of my husband's estate.

205
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:45,029
My husband is to
go to Southampton...

206
00:09:45,247 --> 00:09:46,657
...for at least twelve days.

207
00:09:46,873 --> 00:09:47,869
Will that be enough time for you?

208
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,075
First you make a
demand that suggests...

209
00:09:50,293 --> 00:09:52,369
...we haven't discussed the
proposition this evening.

210
00:09:52,587 --> 00:09:54,746
Second, you increase your
demand by at least 12.

211
00:09:54,965 --> 00:09:56,673
Third, you add to the
proposition a time limit.

212
00:09:56,883 --> 00:09:59,339
And fourth, you expect me
to start at once.

213
00:09:59,678 --> 00:10:01,884
Four factors, you have convinced us...

214
00:10:02,097 --> 00:10:04,634
...are well within your
talents and capabilities.

215
00:10:07,185 --> 00:10:08,643
Your terms are exorbitant...

216
00:10:13,191 --> 00:10:14,222
...so must mine be.

217
00:10:15,109 --> 00:10:16,604
<i>She loves...</i>

218
00:10:16,819 --> 00:10:20,948
<i>... and she confesses to.</i>

219
00:10:21,407 --> 00:10:24,243
<i>There is then at last...</i>

220
00:10:24,452 --> 00:10:27,074
<i>... no more to do.</i>

221
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:30,198
The conditions of the
agreement are:

222
00:10:31,251 --> 00:10:33,576
...My services as
draughtsman for twelve days...

223
00:10:33,795 --> 00:10:35,871
...for the manufacture
of 12 drawings...

224
00:10:36,673 --> 00:10:37,953
...of the estate and gardens...

225
00:10:38,174 --> 00:10:41,010
...parks and outlying
buildings of Mr. Herbert's Property.

226
00:10:42,137 --> 00:10:45,090
The sites for the twelve drawings
to be chosen at my discretion...

227
00:10:47,016 --> 00:10:48,843
...though advised by Mrs. Herbert.

228
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:53,261
For which, Thomas, I am willing
to pay eight pounds a drawing...

229
00:10:55,357 --> 00:10:58,607
...to provide full board for
Mr. Neville and his servant...

230
00:11:00,111 --> 00:11:01,107
...and...

231
00:11:02,572 --> 00:11:03,652
And, Madam?

232
00:11:06,576 --> 00:11:08,320
And to meet Mr. Neville in private...

233
00:11:08,537 --> 00:11:11,657
...and to comply with his requests
concerning his pleasure with me.

234
00:11:38,358 --> 00:11:40,066
<i>Curriculum for the Execution...</i>

235

<i>... closed or otherwise disturbed.</i>

259
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,189
Your Mr. Neville, Sarah...

260
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:45,972
...has the God-like power
of emptying the landscape.

261
00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:48,694
It is a wonder the birds still sing.

262
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:50,777
If they stopped...

263
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:54,026
...I doubt whether Mr. Neville
would appreciate the difference.

264
00:13:54,869 --> 00:13:57,738
His attitude to
nature is strictly material.

265
00:13:58,704 --> 00:13:59,735
Thomas...

266
00:14:00,247 --> 00:14:02,952
...why is Mr. Neville
interested in my sheets?

267
00:14:03,626 --> 00:14:06,081
He is to draw them
wet outside the laundry.

268
00:14:07,421 --> 00:14:08,335
Wet?

269
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:09,869
Why does he want them wet?

270
00:14:10,341 --> 00:14:11,835
I cannot answer you that.

271
00:14:12,635 --> 00:14:15,173
Perhaps he has fond
memories of being a baby.

272
00:14:23,104 --> 00:14:24,562
<i>For Drawing Number 3.</i>

273
00:14:25,356 --> 00:14:27,929

north side of the house...</i>

275
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,980

<i>... for the disposition of the linen.</i>

282
00:15:01,684 --> 00:15:03,427
I am delighted to see that...

283
00:15:03,644 --> 00:15:06,052
...you've loosened your
clothing as I requested.

284
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,482
When your husband had
the pear trees grafted...

285
00:15:13,904 --> 00:15:15,362
...do you know if he
asked for the advice...

286
00:15:15,572 --> 00:15:16,983
...of Mr. Seymour's gardener?

287
00:15:17,532 --> 00:15:18,481
We...

288
00:15:20,744 --> 00:15:22,618
You do not speak very loud.

289
00:15:23,497 --> 00:15:24,445
We...

290
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,832
We do not know
Mr. Seymour's gardener.

291
00:15:28,043 --> 00:15:28,659
I see.

292
00:15:28,877 --> 00:15:29,873
Mr. Neville.

293
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:32,457
The trees have been poorly cared for.

294
00:15:32,673 --> 00:15:34,416
The angle between the branches...

295
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,756
...and the main trunk is too steep.

296
00:15:37,552 --> 00:15:39,794
But the original work is good.

297
00:15:40,597 --> 00:15:42,590
And what of the pears themselves...

298
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:44,721
...in season.

299
00:15:45,686 --> 00:15:46,848

<i>... and the gravel on the
drive will be left undisturbed.</i>

306

burned that will issue smoke...</i>

<i>Such animals as are presently
grazing in the fields...</i>

316
00:18:33,726 --> 00:18:34,639
Good day, Mr. Neville.

Mr. Talmann.

318
00:18:40,107 --> 00:18:41,899
I see you have selected a fine view...

319
00:18:42,109 --> 00:18:43,438
...for my son to inherit.

320
00:18:43,694 --> 00:18:45,189
I prefer, for the moment...

321
00:18:45,404 --> 00:18:48,109
...to regard the view as
the property of Mr. Herbert.

322
00:18:48,491 --> 00:18:49,440
Thomas...

323
00:18:50,243 --> 00:18:53,362
...see that Clarissa doesn't go
to the laundry around noon.

324
00:18:55,623 --> 00:18:58,245
<i>And, come to my withdrawing room...</i>

325
00:18:58,459 --> 00:19:00,119
<i>... this afternoon with some ink.</i>

326
00:19:01,379 --> 00:19:03,087
<i>I want to send to
Mr. Herbert to know...</i>

327
00:19:03,298 --> 00:19:05,290
<i>... by which road
he intends to return.</i>

328
00:19:13,515 --> 00:19:16,849
Is it your intention to continue
to stand there Mr. Talmann?

329
00:19:18,937 --> 00:19:21,226
I can see the view
very adequately from here.

330
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,389
Thank you.

331
00:19:28,697 --> 00:19:30,773
Will you be wearing
the same clothes tomorrow?

332
00:19:33,411 --> 00:19:34,324
Why?

333
00:19:36,038 --> 00:19:37,117
I have not decided.

334
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,962
It depends on my servants.

335
00:19:44,297 --> 00:19:45,292
Is it important?

336
00:19:49,384 --> 00:19:50,499
Maybe I will.

Really?

348
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,120
Not that I know.

349
00:21:19,932 --> 00:21:20,797
Mr. Lucas...

350
00:21:21,016 --> 00:21:23,472
...was a man whose enthusiasms
were divided equally...

351
00:21:23,685 --> 00:21:25,559
...between his
garden and his children.

352
00:21:26,021 --> 00:21:27,681
Whenever his wife conceived...

353
00:21:28,065 --> 00:21:30,058
...Mr. Lucas planted fruit-trees.

354
00:21:31,485 --> 00:21:34,237
His wife seldom came to
a successful labour...

355
00:21:34,446 --> 00:21:37,234
...and those children she was
blessed with died before weaning.

356
00:21:37,449 --> 00:21:40,450
Mr. Lucas threatened to cut his trees
down, but he never did.

357
00:21:40,661 --> 00:21:42,985
To date there are 11 trees
in his fruit-garden...

358
00:21:43,747 --> 00:21:45,905
...and he knows them all
by their Christian names.

359
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:50,284
The English are not blessed with
the most appropriate fecundity.

360
00:21:50,712 --> 00:21:53,499
They can raise colonies
but not heirs to the throne.

361
00:21:53,798 --> 00:21:56,634
It depends which
colonies you are speaking of.

362
00:21:57,469 --> 00:22:00,138
Some of England's oldest
colonies have heirs in plenty.

363
00:22:00,722 --> 00:22:01,885
Mr. Neville...

364
00:22:02,641 --> 00:22:05,179
...do we have an indication
of Scottish sympathies?

365
00:22:05,394 --> 00:22:07,433
You would be reading far too much...

366
00:22:07,646 --> 00:22:09,639
...into what is simply a
statement of fact.

367
00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:13,565
If the best Englishmen
are foreigners...

368
00:22:14,278 --> 00:22:17,444
...and that seems to be a
simple statement of fact...

369
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,157
...then the best English
painters are foreigners too.

370
00:22:22,785 --> 00:22:25,323
There's no English
painter worthy of the name.

371
00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:28,118
Would you agree Mr. Neville?

372
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:30,492
To be an English painter...

373
00:22:30,793 --> 00:22:32,371
...is a contradictory term.

374
00:22:33,505 --> 00:22:37,205
Then Mr. Herbert shows some sense
in encouraging Mr. Neville.

375
00:22:37,425 --> 00:22:38,884
Mr. Herbert, as we all know...

376
00:22:39,094 --> 00:22:40,374
...is full of contradictions.

377
00:22:40,595 --> 00:22:43,466
Contradictory enough to have
invited you into this house.

378
00:22:43,723 --> 00:22:46,095
Despite his being a man without
airs and graces.

379
00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:47,803
But not privy to whom his wife...

380
00:22:48,019 --> 00:22:49,430
...welcomes into his house.

381
00:22:50,021 --> 00:22:51,895
When my father is away, Louis...

382
00:22:52,107 --> 00:22:55,227
...my mother is at liberty to
run his house as she feels fit.

383
00:22:56,027 --> 00:22:58,234
And she has seen fit
to invite Mr. Neville.

384
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:00,107
A gracious speech, Mrs. Talmann.

385
00:23:00,322 --> 00:23:01,983
To hide all manner of inconveniences.

386
00:23:02,199 --> 00:23:02,864
How is that?

387
00:23:03,075 --> 00:23:03,857
It is apparent.

388
00:23:04,076 --> 00:23:07,445
It isn't from our meeting that
your presumptory regime...

389
00:23:07,663 --> 00:23:09,870
...not only extends to
confining the household...

390
00:23:10,082 --> 00:23:11,826
...like animals in reservations...

391
00:23:12,043 --> 00:23:14,450
...but directing us as to whether
or not we should wear a coat...

392
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,413
...carry a walking-stick or whistle.

393
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,421
When I met you in the garden...

394
00:23:18,632 --> 00:23:20,624
...you were doing all those things.

395
00:23:20,842 --> 00:23:22,669
If you intend being there tomorrow...

396
00:23:22,886 --> 00:23:25,804
...I would wish you to dress and
to behave in the same way.

397
00:23:26,056 --> 00:23:27,550
However, it's beyond my power...

398
00:23:27,766 --> 00:23:30,008
...to describe a whistle
pictorially, whether it comes...

399
00:23:30,227 --> 00:23:33,513
...from an Englishman or from a German
dressed as an Englishman.

400
00:23:34,231 --> 00:23:36,473
And what do you do
about the birds, Mr. Neville?

401
00:23:37,067 --> 00:23:40,151
If you ignore their song, you can't
prevent them from flying across...

402
00:23:40,361 --> 00:23:41,275
...the field of your vision.

403
00:23:41,487 --> 00:23:44,157
The prospect of twelve
fine-weather days...

404
00:23:44,365 --> 00:23:45,480
...with clear skies...

405
00:23:45,783 --> 00:23:48,701
...and sharp shadows
is an excellent proposition...

406
00:23:48,912 --> 00:23:50,157
...but not to be guaranteed.

407
00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:52,121
So I am naturally anxious...

408
00:23:52,332 --> 00:23:53,909
...that time should not be wasted.

409
00:23:54,876 --> 00:23:57,165
It would assist me
greatly therefore...

410
00:23:57,379 --> 00:24:00,748
...if my instructions, which have
been given great consideration...

411
00:24:00,966 --> 00:24:02,424
...should be observed.

412
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:04,172
I'm painstaking enough...

413
00:24:04,386 --> 00:24:07,422
...to notice quite small
changes in the landscape.

414
00:24:07,973 --> 00:24:10,345
Once started,
I make that a committal...

415
00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:12,433
...whatsoever ensues.

416
00:24:12,769 --> 00:24:15,095
And I think you can surmise...

417
00:24:15,313 --> 00:24:19,097
...that it's an attitude from which
I obtain great satisfaction...

418
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:20,855
...and some entertainment.

419
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,096
Thomas...

420
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:03,686
...can you remember, when
Mr. Herbert had his clothes packed...

421
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:05,563
...whether he took his French boots?

422
00:25:14,956 --> 00:25:16,616
How is it that you've contrived...

423
00:25:16,832 --> 00:25:18,825
...to make the garden
so empty of people?

424
00:25:19,252 --> 00:25:22,870
The authority for these drawings
comes from Mrs. Herbert.

425
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:24,666
Do you think that she
is a woman who enjoys...

426
00:25:24,882 --> 00:25:27,290
...having a crowd of people
kick her gravel around...

427
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:30,464
...or move her earth like a
pack of dogs in a herb garden?

428
00:25:31,014 --> 00:25:33,635
I would seek peace
and quiet in a garden...

429
00:25:34,267 --> 00:25:36,721
...and noise and
excitement at a carnival.

430
00:25:37,853 --> 00:25:39,098
Carnem levare.

431
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:42,514
So Mr. Neville, you
would reserve your revelries...

432
00:25:42,733 --> 00:25:44,192
...for a religious occasion.

433
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:46,724
And what of Gethsemane?

434
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:48,985
A wild sort of
garden I shouldn't wonder.

435
00:25:49,698 --> 00:25:52,154
There would be no geometric paths...

436
00:25:52,368 --> 00:25:54,076
...and no Dutch bulbs.

437
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:57,244
We have a Cedar of Lebanon...

438
00:25:58,207 --> 00:25:59,666
...and a Judas tree.

439
00:26:00,584 --> 00:26:02,743
Perhaps we could
cultivate a Tree of Heaven?

440
00:26:03,421 --> 00:26:05,746
The gardens of England
are becoming jungles.

441
00:26:05,965 --> 00:26:07,957
Such exotics are grossly unsuitable.

442
00:26:08,384 --> 00:26:11,587
If the Garden of Eden was planned for
England, God would have seen to it.

443
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:13,002
The Garden of Eden...

444
00:26:13,222 --> 00:26:15,013
...was originally
intended for Ireland.

445
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:18,884
For it was there that St.
Patrick eradicated the snake.

446
00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:21,640
The only useful eradication
in Ireland...

447
00:26:21,854 --> 00:26:23,847
...was performed by
William of Orange...

448
00:26:24,065 --> 00:26:25,607
...four years ago on my birthday.

449
00:26:25,816 --> 00:26:27,892
And happy birthday to you Mr. Talmann.

450
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:31,060
If you are not too old
to receive presents...

451
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,981
...perhaps the gardener and I can
find a snake for your Orangerie.

452
00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:37,818
What?

453
00:26:38,746 --> 00:26:40,121
Good day to you, Mr. Neville.

454
00:26:40,331 --> 00:26:41,245
Good day, Madam.

455
00:26:54,678 --> 00:26:55,591
Philip.

456
00:27:16,242 --> 00:27:17,902
I see the company is assembled.

457
00:27:18,327 --> 00:27:20,236
And what are we to be spectators of?

458
00:27:20,454 --> 00:27:22,198
You must not be surprised.

459
00:27:22,415 --> 00:27:24,158
We are here at your request.

460
00:27:25,084 --> 00:27:26,662
I did not request an audience...

461
00:27:27,128 --> 00:27:28,836
...nor a dinner on the grass.

462
00:27:29,338 --> 00:27:31,081
Perhaps we are to applaud...

463
00:27:31,298 --> 00:27:32,412
...the view.

464
00:27:32,841 --> 00:27:34,834
The scribbler is never satisfied.

465
00:27:35,051 --> 00:27:36,462
He is as insatiable as a...

466
00:27:36,678 --> 00:27:38,635
You've said that Mr.
Talmann should be here...

467
00:27:38,847 --> 00:27:41,516
...dressed as you asked and
carrying a gold-topped cane.

468
00:27:42,309 --> 00:27:43,684
We have taken you at your word.

469
00:27:44,853 --> 00:27:48,721
There was another instruction, but
conveniently I have forgotten it.

470
00:27:48,941 --> 00:27:50,186
Whistling, Sarah.

471
00:27:50,609 --> 00:27:51,807
So much for convenience.

472
00:27:52,027 --> 00:27:54,186
You do not catch me
in the best of tempers...

473
00:27:54,446 --> 00:27:55,822
...wearing yesterday's clothes.

474
00:27:56,031 --> 00:27:57,312
I give you 20 minutes only.

475
00:27:57,533 --> 00:27:59,027
I have a horse to exercise.

476
00:27:59,243 --> 00:28:01,152
Then, Sir, please take your place.

477
00:28:01,578 --> 00:28:02,658
I will take a walk.

478
00:28:02,871 --> 00:28:04,152
Come with me, Maria.

479
00:28:04,498 --> 00:28:06,705
We have a dog to exercise.

480
00:28:15,091 --> 00:28:17,000
A little to the left, if you please.

481
00:28:18,094 --> 00:28:19,505
And puff out your cheeks.

482
00:28:20,347 --> 00:28:21,461
Why should I do that?

483
00:28:21,681 --> 00:28:23,840
Because last time you were whistling.

484
00:28:24,684 --> 00:28:26,594
A tune perhaps not
readily recognisable...

485
00:28:26,811 --> 00:28:28,222
...even by its own composer.

486
00:28:31,566 --> 00:28:32,480
Look, Madam...

487
00:28:34,361 --> 00:28:35,903
...this man has no head.

488
00:28:36,321 --> 00:28:38,065
A typical German characteristic.

489
00:28:38,657 --> 00:28:39,653
Mr. Neville...

490
00:28:40,701 --> 00:28:42,574
...you're talking about my son-in-law.

491
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,864
By the grace of God...

492
00:28:45,163 --> 00:28:46,955
...you are to have
a grandson by him...

493
00:28:47,499 --> 00:28:48,413
...some day.

494
00:28:49,208 --> 00:28:51,248
Is that not a better thing to talk of?

495
00:28:52,962 --> 00:28:54,836
And you mock my money
and my person...

496
00:28:55,048 --> 00:28:56,328
...to draw caricatures.

497
00:28:58,009 --> 00:29:00,048
With my memory, 3
pictures in the house...

498
00:29:00,261 --> 00:29:02,337
...and your knowledge
of the subject...

499
00:29:02,555 --> 00:29:05,093
...I intend to place
the head of Mr. Herbert...

500
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,548
...on these shoulders...

501
00:29:06,976 --> 00:29:08,886
...as an appropriate
acknowledgement...

502
00:29:09,104 --> 00:29:11,345
...of your husband and his property.

503
00:29:12,607 --> 00:29:13,852
If he should return?

504
00:29:15,902 --> 00:29:17,811
Why, Madam, what a
strange thing to say?

505
00:29:19,739 --> 00:29:21,364
If he should return home to me.

506
00:30:28,556 --> 00:30:29,470
So...

507
00:30:31,935 --> 00:30:34,508
...I am grieving...

508
00:30:35,605 --> 00:30:36,803
...because Mr. Herbert...

509
00:30:37,023 --> 00:30:38,103
...is away.

510
00:30:42,654 --> 00:30:43,733
Yes, Mother.

511
00:32:13,368 --> 00:32:15,242
The Contract is void, Mr. Neville.

512
00:32:16,663 --> 00:32:17,862
I cannot meet you again.

513
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,869
Mrs. Herbert, sit here.

514
00:32:20,084 --> 00:32:21,459
Move your head into the shade.

515
00:32:30,553 --> 00:32:33,090
Don't you think the gardeners
have excelled themselves?

516
00:32:38,435 --> 00:32:40,842
You should not continue to draw.

517
00:32:42,521 --> 00:32:44,846
I'm not able to continue
the terms of our contract.

518
00:32:45,065 --> 00:32:46,560
The fee is yours,
as is the hospitality.

519
00:32:46,775 --> 00:32:48,020
I was about to say...

520
00:32:48,485 --> 00:32:51,059
...that in spite of my
satisfaction at continuing...

521
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,605
...the prospect in such
delightful circumstances...

522
00:32:53,908 --> 00:32:57,359
...the peak of my delight is
obtained in those short minutes...

523
00:32:57,578 --> 00:32:58,741
...when we are together.

524
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:01,319
I would regret losing them.

525
00:33:03,542 --> 00:33:05,334
Besides, I do not
need to remind you...

526
00:33:05,545 --> 00:33:07,952
...that the contract was made
between two people.

527
00:33:08,923 --> 00:33:11,794
It will take the consent of
both signatories to make it void.

528
00:33:14,053 --> 00:33:17,671
I feel that from this
position I cannot adequately see...

529
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:19,266
...what I'm supposed
to be seeing and...

530
00:33:19,475 --> 00:33:22,144
...I must therefore ask you to find
some other resting-place.

531
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:23,884
At least until 4 o'clock...

532
00:33:24,104 --> 00:33:27,307
...when our next meeting is to be
consummated as arranged.

533
00:33:40,955 --> 00:33:42,947
Who is this child
who walks the garden...

534
00:33:43,165 --> 00:33:44,992
...with such a
solemn look on his face?

535
00:33:45,584 --> 00:33:47,541
That is my husband's nephew.

536
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,746
He attracts servants
like a little midget King.

537
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,664
What is his patrimony?

538
00:33:54,719 --> 00:33:56,711
His father was
killed at Ausbergenfeld.

539
00:33:57,555 --> 00:33:58,586
His mother became a Catholic.

540
00:33:58,806 --> 00:34:00,299
So my husband brought
him to England.

541
00:34:00,515 --> 00:34:02,424
To be reared as a little Protestant.

542
00:34:02,809 --> 00:34:05,347
He was an orphan and
needed to be looked after.

543
00:34:05,562 --> 00:34:06,392
An orphan...

544
00:34:06,605 --> 00:34:08,597
...because his mother
became a Catholic?

545
00:34:32,172 --> 00:34:33,880
Philip, find out what's happening.

546
00:34:43,641 --> 00:34:45,052
Mr. Neville, Sir...

547
00:34:45,435 --> 00:34:46,929
...I'm sorry about the coat.

548
00:34:47,729 --> 00:34:49,353
It was not I that put it there.

549
00:34:49,898 --> 00:34:50,929
Is that so, Madam...

550
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:53,272
...then who did?

551
00:34:54,319 --> 00:34:55,149
I'll ask.

552
00:34:55,654 --> 00:34:57,527
No, don't ask. Leave it there.

553
00:34:59,449 --> 00:35:02,367
Someone is getting careless.
The garden is becoming a robe-room.

554
00:35:02,577 --> 00:35:04,155
I wonder what they
keep in their clothespress.

555
00:35:04,371 --> 00:35:05,450
Plants perhaps.

556
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,451
Who will be your
husband's direct heir after you?

557
00:35:13,171 --> 00:35:14,286
A future grandson...

558
00:35:14,965 --> 00:35:16,838
...though not after me.

559
00:35:17,508 --> 00:35:19,086
Mr. Herbert does not believe...

560
00:35:19,594 --> 00:35:21,670
...in a woman owning property.

561
00:35:21,971 --> 00:35:24,047
And what about your
daughter and her husband?

562
00:35:24,348 --> 00:35:27,018
They would be
guardians on a grandson's behalf.

563
00:35:27,226 --> 00:35:29,302
Do you intend to study legal matters?

564
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,180
You must forgive my curiosity.

565
00:35:31,397 --> 00:35:32,512
Open your knees.

566
00:35:34,234 --> 00:35:35,977
To have possession of my person...

567
00:35:36,236 --> 00:35:38,773
...is not an excuse to be
privy to my husband's Will.

568
00:35:39,196 --> 00:35:41,402
Your loyalty is exemplary.

569
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:45,907
But what will happen to the estate
if your daughter has no heirs?

570
00:35:47,204 --> 00:35:48,829
I don't like to think about it.

571
00:35:50,374 --> 00:35:51,916
The estate was my father's.

572
00:35:52,626 --> 00:35:55,034
Mr. Herbert obtained
it through marriage to me.

573
00:36:02,844 --> 00:36:05,513
It is imperative,
Augustus, that in representing me...

574
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,638
...you ask of yourself the very best.

575
00:36:08,391 --> 00:36:11,061
And you do not fraternise
with whomsoever you choose.

576
00:36:12,312 --> 00:36:16,096
And chasing sheep is a
tiresome habit best left to shepherds.

577
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:19,266
If Mr. Neville chases
sheep he is not to be emulated.

578
00:36:19,945 --> 00:36:21,937
Drawing is an attribution
worth very little...

579
00:36:22,489 --> 00:36:24,565
...and in England
worth nothing at all.

580
00:36:24,992 --> 00:36:26,450
If you must scribble...

581
00:36:26,743 --> 00:36:30,195
...I suggest that your time would be
better spent in studying mathematics.

582
00:36:30,747 --> 00:36:31,862
I will engage a tutor...

583
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:35,495
...and, who knows,
one day you, Augustus...

584
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:38,664
...may add the Talmann
name to the Royal Society.

585
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:41,497
Augustus...

586
00:36:46,012 --> 00:36:47,720
...your tutor of course
must be German.

587
00:36:47,931 --> 00:36:51,465
There are already far too many English
influences on your life as it is.

588
00:37:06,866 --> 00:37:09,358
Mr. Neville is our
resident draughtsman.

589
00:37:09,911 --> 00:37:13,279
He is making one or two drawings
of Mr. Herbert's house and estate.

590
00:37:13,581 --> 00:37:15,657
I've heard of your
prowess, Mr. Neville.

591
00:37:16,041 --> 00:37:17,417
Indeed I've heard more than that.

592
00:37:17,626 --> 00:37:19,666
I've heard you're
not a conventional man.

593
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,878
Mr. Neville has planned
his stay here...

594
00:37:22,089 --> 00:37:24,296
...like an officer
in a hostile billet.

595
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:26,294
We've orders to
appear and disappear...

596
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:29,002
...to wear cocked hats, to
eat meals in the open air...

597
00:37:29,222 --> 00:37:31,345
...and to prepare
furniture for inspection.

598
00:37:31,891 --> 00:37:33,006
And yet, Louis...

599
00:37:33,434 --> 00:37:35,925
...I hear that you're not
averse to exchanging exercise...

600
00:37:36,145 --> 00:37:39,680
...on a new horse for standing
to attention in the hot sun...

601
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:41,306
...like a halberdier.

602
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:45,111
What control you
must exercise Mr. Neville.

603
00:37:45,738 --> 00:37:48,526
You might be better
employed as a military man...

604
00:37:48,783 --> 00:37:51,867
...than as someone who
merely draws a landscape.

605
00:37:52,202 --> 00:37:53,365
Mrs. Herbert...

606
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:55,702
...whatever is the
price you must pay...

607
00:37:55,914 --> 00:37:58,370
...to capture this general
who leads the wheat by the ear.

608
00:37:58,584 --> 00:38:01,371
Mrs. Herbert pays no
price she cannot afford.

609
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:05,419
Thanks to her generosity, I am
permitted to take my pleasure...

610
00:38:05,633 --> 00:38:07,958
...without hindrance
on her property...

611
00:38:08,802 --> 00:38:12,847
...and to enjoy the maturing
delights of her country garden.

612
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,797
And, gentlemen...

613
00:38:16,352 --> 00:38:18,428
...there is much
there to be surprised at...

614
00:38:18,688 --> 00:38:19,933
...and applauded.

615
00:39:32,843 --> 00:39:33,709
Board!

616
00:40:05,042 --> 00:40:06,501
Good Afternoon, Mr. Talmann.

617
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,252
Good afternoon, Mr. Neville.

618
00:40:08,462 --> 00:40:09,209
You are late.

619
00:40:09,421 --> 00:40:11,497
I heard the clock strike four
some minutes ago.

620
00:40:11,715 --> 00:40:13,625
That is indeed true.
I met Mr. Porringer.

621
00:40:14,218 --> 00:40:16,424
I'm becoming Mr. Porringer's
taster of victuals.

622
00:40:16,637 --> 00:40:18,380
Does the same thing happen to you?

623
00:40:18,848 --> 00:40:20,472
Today, it was raspberries.

624
00:40:21,016 --> 00:40:23,056
I congratulate you on
today's raspberries...

625
00:40:23,394 --> 00:40:24,674
...but not on yesterday's damsons.

626
00:40:24,895 --> 00:40:27,895
They were tasteless, "geschmacklos".

627
00:40:28,481 --> 00:40:29,976
Like your coat Mr. Talmann.

628
00:40:30,191 --> 00:40:31,306
There is no way...

629
00:40:31,526 --> 00:40:33,851
...that I was going to
wear that coat a third day.

630
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:34,984
We are indeed...

631
00:40:35,197 --> 00:40:37,070
...losing the novelty
of this situation.

632
00:40:37,282 --> 00:40:39,488
First I was graced with the
presence of Mrs. Talmann...

633
00:40:39,701 --> 00:40:42,109
...two servants, a maid and a meal
served on silver-plate.

634
00:40:42,329 --> 00:40:43,111
Now what have we?

635
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:45,536
Yourself dressed in the wrong clothes.

636
00:40:45,749 --> 00:40:46,994
Mr. Neville, enough.

637
00:40:47,209 --> 00:40:49,332
Your enthusiasm for
complaint knows no limit.

638
00:40:50,087 --> 00:40:52,791
For a fee of 8 pounds your
impertinence is too expensive.

639
00:40:53,006 --> 00:40:54,999
Would you have me be
impertinent for nothing?

640
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,415
For nothing...

641
00:40:56,635 --> 00:40:58,793
...I would have you
run off my property.

642
00:40:59,012 --> 00:40:59,842
Good day.

643
00:41:00,055 --> 00:41:01,715
Your property, Mr. Talmann?

644
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:06,599
Mr. Talmann, you've forgotten
your riding-boots.

645
00:41:07,895 --> 00:41:09,438
They are not mine, Mr. Neville.

646
00:41:10,106 --> 00:41:11,980
I felt sure that they were yours.

647
00:41:36,925 --> 00:41:39,131
Why doesn't your husband
have the moat cleaned out?

648
00:41:39,803 --> 00:41:42,590
He doesn't like to see the fish.
Carp live too long.

649
00:41:42,806 --> 00:41:44,180
They remind him of Catholics.

650
00:41:45,683 --> 00:41:46,881
Besides from his window...

651
00:41:47,101 --> 00:41:49,141
...the duckweed could
be mistaken for lawn.

652
00:41:49,353 --> 00:41:50,301
Can he swim?

653
00:41:51,605 --> 00:41:53,015
I've never seen him swim.

654
00:42:46,076 --> 00:42:47,618
Good morning, Mrs. Herbert.

655
00:42:50,664 --> 00:42:52,372
This morning I'm progressing well.

656
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:55,082
I am beginning to enjoy myself.

657
00:42:56,545 --> 00:42:58,668
Would you be so good as to sit?

658
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,725
It's a little chilly perhaps, but I
think you tremble too much.

659
00:43:14,979 --> 00:43:17,186
It is not easy for me
this way to use your person...

660
00:43:17,398 --> 00:43:19,438
...as I would like to.
Would you stand?

661
00:43:25,365 --> 00:43:27,653
The ladder, as you
can see, has now become...

662
00:43:28,409 --> 00:43:30,153
...a meretricious vertical.

663
00:43:31,413 --> 00:43:33,370
But I forgive you
for standing it there.

664
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,499
What use have I for the ladder.

665
00:43:35,709 --> 00:43:36,907
It does not go anywhere.

666
00:43:41,589 --> 00:43:43,249
Would you be so good as to kneel?

667
00:44:07,949 --> 00:44:09,063
Kneel, Madam.

668
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:17,863
If you have any influence
over your son-in-law...

669
00:44:19,002 --> 00:44:21,918
...I suggest that he travel over
to Mr. Seymour's to see...

670
00:44:22,129 --> 00:44:23,789
...what can be done with limes...

671
00:44:24,339 --> 00:44:26,415
...by doing as little as possible.

672
00:44:29,303 --> 00:44:30,417
Limes, Madam...

673
00:44:31,472 --> 00:44:33,381
...can smell so sweet.

674
00:44:35,601 --> 00:44:38,637
Especially when they are
allowed to bloom without hindrance.

675
00:44:41,023 --> 00:44:43,016
And it will shortly be time to bloom.

676
00:44:46,153 --> 00:44:47,102
Is it true...

677
00:44:47,321 --> 00:44:49,646
...that you would wish
to see Mr. Herbert dead?

678
00:44:49,991 --> 00:44:51,615
I've no great love for Mr. Herbert.

679
00:44:52,535 --> 00:44:54,444
Goodness, a provocative question.

680
00:44:54,662 --> 00:44:55,526
Then why stay?

681
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:59,328
Mr. Noyes has a great
attachment to my mother, Mr. Neville.

682
00:45:00,207 --> 00:45:02,200
I'm employed by Mr.
Herbert as Estate Manager.

683
00:45:02,418 --> 00:45:03,663
Mr. Herbert is often away...

684
00:45:03,878 --> 00:45:05,870
...and I can make myself
useful to Mrs. Herbert.

685
00:45:06,088 --> 00:45:07,832
In more ways than one I presume.

686
00:45:08,883 --> 00:45:11,006
But is it not that way
which is most important?

687
00:45:11,218 --> 00:45:12,214
Your questions...

688
00:45:12,428 --> 00:45:15,097
...are far too imprudent
and provocative in this company.

689
00:45:15,306 --> 00:45:17,464
Then you'd rather I asked
them behind your back?

690
00:45:17,683 --> 00:45:21,467
Mr. Noyes' position in this house
is well known to us all.

691
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:23,261
It is a...

692
00:45:23,731 --> 00:45:25,012
...a difficult position.

693
00:45:26,234 --> 00:45:28,392
I'm surprised that
you all concur in it.

694
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:31,489
The organisation of this
house is Mr. Herbert's affair.

695
00:45:31,864 --> 00:45:34,949
My father and Mr. Noyes
were once great friends.

696
00:45:35,285 --> 00:45:36,067
And then?

697
00:45:36,619 --> 00:45:39,192
My mother was at one
time promised to Mr. Noyes.

698
00:45:41,331 --> 00:45:43,905
Your position Mr. Noyes
is then a consolation.

699
00:45:44,209 --> 00:45:46,961
You overstep your privileges in being
a guest in Mrs. Herbert's house.

700
00:45:47,171 --> 00:45:48,416
Sit down, Mr. Noyes.

701
00:45:48,756 --> 00:45:50,250
I merely pursue an enquiry.

702
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:55,715
It may help me to understand
what is happening in the garden.

703
00:46:17,117 --> 00:46:20,486
<i>That shirt, Mr. Neville, is
prominent enough in your drawing.</i>

704
00:46:22,539 --> 00:46:25,575
<i>Would it be possible
to disguise its presence?</i>

705
00:46:26,126 --> 00:46:28,035
<i>I try very hard...</i>

706
00:46:28,378 --> 00:46:30,916
<i>... never to distort or to dissemble.</i>

707
00:46:32,341 --> 00:46:34,832
<i>Would that always be you
method of working?</i>

708
00:46:35,052 --> 00:46:35,917
<i>It would.</i>

709
00:46:37,471 --> 00:46:38,301
Well...

710
00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:41,550
...let me make a little speech.

711
00:46:43,477 --> 00:46:45,933
In your drawing of the
north side of the house...

712
00:46:46,897 --> 00:46:50,313
...my father's cloak lies wrapped
around a figure of Bacchus.

713
00:46:51,735 --> 00:46:53,111
In the drawing of the
prospect over which...

714
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,893
...my husband turns an
appreciative gaze...

715
00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:00,191
...you will have noticed that there
is unclaimed a pair of riding boots.

716
00:47:01,494 --> 00:47:03,985
In the drawing of the
park from the east side...

717
00:47:04,331 --> 00:47:07,201
...it is possible to see leaning
against my father's wardroom...

718
00:47:07,417 --> 00:47:10,252
...a ladder usually put to
use for the collecting of apples.

719
00:47:11,463 --> 00:47:13,040
And in the drawing of the laundry...

720
00:47:13,256 --> 00:47:16,957
...there is a jacket of my
father's slit across the chest.

721
00:47:18,887 --> 00:47:21,592
Do you not think that before
long you might find the body...

722
00:47:21,807 --> 00:47:23,467
...that inhabited all those clothes?

723
00:47:23,684 --> 00:47:26,768
I am thinking very hard
about the drawing you've left out.

724
00:47:27,271 --> 00:47:29,512
And you, Madam,
were in that drawing.

725
00:47:29,731 --> 00:47:30,727
Are you sure?

726
00:47:30,941 --> 00:47:32,601
The sound of you was in the drawing.

727
00:47:32,818 --> 00:47:34,097
You were playing the spinet.

728
00:47:34,902 --> 00:47:36,729
I thought that we had discussed...

729
00:47:36,946 --> 00:47:40,149
...the pictorial equivalents of
noise without conclusion.

730
00:47:40,992 --> 00:47:42,534
Perhaps it was not
me playing the spinet.

731
00:47:42,744 --> 00:47:44,072
Have you thought of that?

732
00:47:44,662 --> 00:47:45,576
Then who was it?

733
00:47:45,788 --> 00:47:48,244
You see, Mr. Neville,
you are already beginning...

734
00:47:48,458 --> 00:47:50,166
...to play the game rather skilfully.

735
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:51,835
Four garments and a ladder...

736
00:47:52,378 --> 00:47:54,086
...do not lead us to a corpse.

737
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:57,330
I said nothing about a corpse.

738
00:47:58,635 --> 00:48:00,343
You are ingenious.

739
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:03,672
It is as if you'd planned it.

740
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:07,178
Your father is in Southampton.

741
00:48:07,393 --> 00:48:10,062
He would not miss his
clothes or notice the ladder.

742
00:48:10,271 --> 00:48:12,179
Is my father in Southampton,
Mr. Neville?

743
00:48:13,314 --> 00:48:14,595
My mother told you that.

744
00:48:15,567 --> 00:48:18,402
And you must realise that
she is a lady of few words...

745
00:48:19,195 --> 00:48:21,651
...and not incapable of
a few stratagems.

746
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:23,897
Haven't you thought how hard...

747
00:48:24,117 --> 00:48:25,825
...she persuaded you to be
her draughtsman...

748
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:29,455
...to draw her husband's
house while her husband was away?

749
00:48:29,664 --> 00:48:31,657
Her explanation for
that can be supported.

750
00:48:31,917 --> 00:48:35,202
Perhaps you have
taken a great deal on trust.

751
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:38,203
I look forward to the
eventual purpose and...

752
00:48:38,423 --> 00:48:40,083
...outcome of this ingenuity.

753
00:48:41,009 --> 00:48:43,880
My last six drawings will
be redolent of the mystery.

754
00:48:45,472 --> 00:48:48,888
I will proceed step by
step to the heart of the matter.

755
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:52,144
Perhaps to the heart of my father?

756
00:48:52,729 --> 00:48:55,054
Lying crimson on a
piece of green grass?

757
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:58,774
What a pity that your
drawings are in black and white.

758
00:48:58,985 --> 00:49:00,693
You rush ahead.

759
00:49:01,529 --> 00:49:02,940
The items are innocent.

760
00:49:03,531 --> 00:49:05,571
Taken one by one,
they could so be construed.

761
00:49:05,784 --> 00:49:09,199
Taken together you could be
regarded as a witness to misadventure.

762
00:49:09,996 --> 00:49:11,075
Misadventure?

763
00:49:12,457 --> 00:49:14,200
What misadventure?
There is no misadventure.

764
00:49:14,417 --> 00:49:16,540
And more than a witness.

765
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:19,579
An accessory to misadventure.

766
00:49:21,049 --> 00:49:22,424
You are fanciful.

767
00:49:22,801 --> 00:49:23,797
Mr. Neville...

768
00:49:24,803 --> 00:49:26,594
...I have grown to
believe that a really...

769
00:49:26,805 --> 00:49:29,509
...intelligent man
makes an indifferent painter.

770
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:33,388
For painting requires
a certain blindness.

771
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:37,558
A partial refusal to be
aware of all the options.

772
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,477
An intelligent man
will know more about...

773
00:49:40,693 --> 00:49:42,520
...what he is drawing
than he will see.

774
00:49:43,529 --> 00:49:46,696
And in the space between
knowing and seeing, he will become...

775
00:49:47,742 --> 00:49:49,022
...constrained...

776
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:51,617
...unable to pursue an idea strongly.

777
00:49:52,538 --> 00:49:55,742
Fearing that the discerning,
those who he is eager to please...

778
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:57,702
...will find him wanting
if he does not put in...

779
00:49:57,919 --> 00:50:01,418
...not only what he knows,
but what they know as well.

780
00:50:02,632 --> 00:50:03,711
You, Mr. Neville...

781
00:50:04,217 --> 00:50:07,882
...if you are an intelligent man
and thus an indifferent painter...

782
00:50:08,096 --> 00:50:10,930
...will perceive that a construction
such as I have suggested...

783
00:50:11,181 --> 00:50:14,052
...could well be placed on the
evidence contained in you drawing.

784
00:50:15,394 --> 00:50:18,063
If you, are as I have heard tell...

785
00:50:18,606 --> 00:50:20,314
...a talented draughtsman...

786
00:50:21,317 --> 00:50:24,104
...then I imagine that you
could suppose that the objects...

787
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,989
...I have drawn you attention to,
form no plan...

788
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:30,444
...stratagem or indictment.

789
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:31,989
Indictment, Madam?

790
00:50:34,705 --> 00:50:36,200
You are ingenious.

791
00:50:36,624 --> 00:50:38,747
I am allowed to be
neither of the two things...

792
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,703
...that I wish to be at the same time.

793
00:50:42,255 --> 00:50:43,535
I propose...

794
00:50:43,756 --> 00:50:46,674
...since I am in a position to
throw a connecting plot over...

795
00:50:46,884 --> 00:50:49,209
...the inconsequential
items in your drawing...

796
00:50:50,262 --> 00:50:52,717
...an interpretative plot
that I could explain to others...

797
00:50:52,931 --> 00:50:55,007
...to account for my
father's disappearance.

798
00:50:55,309 --> 00:50:58,891
And there's no word now of my
father having arrived in Southampton.

799
00:51:00,647 --> 00:51:03,055
I propose that we could come to...

800
00:51:04,109 --> 00:51:05,438
...some arrangement...

801
00:51:05,861 --> 00:51:08,149
...that might protect you...

802
00:51:09,239 --> 00:51:10,781
...and humour me.

803
00:51:12,367 --> 00:51:14,655
I suggest that we come
to a similar arrangement...

804
00:51:14,869 --> 00:51:16,661
...as you have struck with my mother.

805
00:51:19,499 --> 00:51:21,907
I would like you now to
accompany me to the library...

806
00:51:22,293 --> 00:51:24,749
...where I know that
Mr. Noyes is waiting for us.

807
00:51:49,529 --> 00:51:52,695
<i>And for each
remaining drawing to agree.</i>

808
00:51:53,699 --> 00:51:56,025
<i>And for each
remaining drawing to agree.</i>

809
00:51:56,577 --> 00:52:00,029
<i>To meet Mrs Talmann, in private.</i>

810
00:52:00,665 --> 00:52:03,334
<i>And to agree to meet
Mrs. Talmann in private.</i>

811
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:06,783
And to comply with her requests...

812
00:52:07,004 --> 00:52:09,459
...concerning her pleasure with me.

813
00:52:10,716 --> 00:52:12,625
And to comply with her requests...

814
00:52:12,843 --> 00:52:15,334
...concerning her pleasure with me.

815
00:52:23,604 --> 00:52:24,767
<i>Drawing Number 7.</i>

816
00:52:25,189 --> 00:52:27,395
<i>From 7 o'clock in
the morning until 9...</i>

817
00:52:27,608 --> 00:52:30,181
<i>... the front prospect
of the house will be kept clear...</i>

818
00:52:30,402 --> 00:52:32,894
<i>... of members of the household,
household servants...</i>

819
00:52:33,114 --> 00:52:34,394
<i>... horses and carriages.</i>

820
00:52:38,077 --> 00:52:39,322
<i>Drawing Number 8.</i>

821
00:52:39,787 --> 00:52:41,863
<i>From 9 o'clock in
the morning until 11...</i>

822
00:52:42,248 --> 00:52:44,323
<i>... the gardens in front
of the bath house building...</i>

823
00:52:44,541 --> 00:52:45,620
<i>... will be kept clear.</i>

824
00:52:46,001 --> 00:52:47,993
<i>No coals will be
burnt to cause smoke...</i>

825
00:52:48,211 --> 00:52:50,370
<i>... to issue from
the bath house chimney.</i>

826
00:53:15,781 --> 00:53:17,857
<i>From 11 o'clock in
the morning until 1...</i>

827
00:53:18,284 --> 00:53:20,691
<i>... the yew tree walk in the
centre of the lower garden...</i>

828
00:53:20,911 --> 00:53:22,321
<i>... will be kept completely clear...</i>

829
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:24,660
<i>... and all members of
Mr. Herbert's family...</i>

830
00:53:24,873 --> 00:53:27,494
<i>... members of his
household staff and animals.</i>

831
00:54:05,746 --> 00:54:07,027
It is time, Mr. Neville.

832
00:54:12,586 --> 00:54:14,911
<i>From 2 o'clock in
the afternoon until 4...</i>

833
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:17,338
<i>... the back of the house
and the sheep pasture...</i>

834
00:54:17,549 --> 00:54:20,301
<i>... on the eastern side, will
be kept free of all members...</i>

835
00:54:20,511 --> 00:54:23,132
<i>... of the household
and farm servants.</i>

836
00:54:50,999 --> 00:54:53,122
The reason I've suggested
you come here is...

837
00:54:53,919 --> 00:54:56,207
...because I've borrowed
this painting from the house.

838
00:54:56,421 --> 00:54:57,335
Would you stand?

839
00:55:02,302 --> 00:55:03,927
Are you not intrigued by it?

840
00:55:05,889 --> 00:55:07,763
I confess I have
paid it little attention.

841
00:55:15,148 --> 00:55:17,307
Your husband surprises me...

842
00:55:17,526 --> 00:55:19,981
...with his eccentric
and eclectic taste.

843
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,775
Whilst most of his peers are
content to collect portraits...

844
00:55:22,989 --> 00:55:25,361
...mostly of an
edifying family connection...

845
00:55:25,575 --> 00:55:28,030
...Mr. Herbert seems
to collect anything.

846
00:55:29,579 --> 00:55:31,322
Perhaps he has eye for optical theory.

847
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:34,791
Or the plight of lovers.

848
00:55:36,586 --> 00:55:38,080
Or the passing of time.

849
00:55:40,173 --> 00:55:41,122
What do you think?

850
00:55:42,842 --> 00:55:44,586
Perhaps, Madam, he has...

851
00:55:45,804 --> 00:55:47,595
...and I would stand
by him in this...

852
00:55:48,014 --> 00:55:51,181
...an interest in
the pictorial conceit.

853
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,928
Can you see why your
husband had reason to buy it?

854
00:55:56,189 --> 00:55:57,896
It's of a garden.
That's reason enough.

855
00:55:58,107 --> 00:56:01,108
True, but what of the events
that are happening within it?

856
00:56:03,446 --> 00:56:05,154
Shall we peruse it together?

857
00:56:06,949 --> 00:56:08,028
Do you see...

858
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:11,614
...a narrative in these
apparently unrelated episodes?

859
00:56:12,163 --> 00:56:15,614
Theirs drama is there not
in this overpopulated garden.

860
00:56:18,252 --> 00:56:19,497
What intrigue is here?

861
00:56:21,506 --> 00:56:23,997
Do you think the characters
have something to tell us?

862
00:56:25,885 --> 00:56:27,629
Would you know if your daughter...

863
00:56:29,138 --> 00:56:31,297
...had any particular
interest in this painting?

864
00:56:33,726 --> 00:56:35,269
<i>Could you put a season to it?</i>

865
00:56:36,437 --> 00:56:39,010
<i>Do you have an opinion?</i>

866
00:56:43,402 --> 00:56:45,858
<i>What infidelities
are portrayed here?</i>

867
00:56:53,162 --> 00:56:54,325
<i>Do you think...</i>

868
00:56:55,331 --> 00:56:56,991
<i>... that murder is being prepared?</i>

869
00:57:05,132 --> 00:57:07,837
Did you hear that a horse
had been found at Strides...

870
00:57:08,511 --> 00:57:11,381
...which is about three
miles from here on the road...

871
00:57:11,722 --> 00:57:14,130
...if followed long enough
could lead you to Southampton.

872
00:57:14,434 --> 00:57:17,137
I will stay dressed,
Mr. Neville, you will not.

873
00:57:17,602 --> 00:57:21,267
Mr. Clarke says the
horse has been badly treated.

874
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:24,185
All roads can lead to
Southampton...

875
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,772
...if the traveller on
horse is ingenious enough.

876
00:57:27,111 --> 00:57:29,863
I've heard of a horse
that found its way to Dover...

877
00:57:30,323 --> 00:57:32,565
...and boarded a
ship taking hay to Calais.

878
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:36,618
The French do not treat horses kindly.

879
00:57:36,913 --> 00:57:37,862
They eat them.

880
00:57:39,874 --> 00:57:42,199
Was your horse partly eaten?

881
00:57:43,086 --> 00:57:44,284
May I leave my hat on?

882
00:57:44,546 --> 00:57:47,500
Your chair looks insignificant
out there, Mr. Neville.

883
00:57:49,134 --> 00:57:52,004
What significant
assumption are we to make...

884
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:54,925
...of a wounded horse
belonging to your father...

885
00:57:55,222 --> 00:57:57,713
...found on the road to Southampton?

886
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:00,137
The first assumption is...

887
00:58:00,895 --> 00:58:03,646
...that the horse has no business
being there without my father...

888
00:58:04,607 --> 00:58:05,982
...and why is it wounded...

889
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:08,852
...and what does
that imply for my father?

890
00:58:09,069 --> 00:58:11,643
And the second assumption
will no doubt implicate me...

891
00:58:12,323 --> 00:58:13,947
...since a saddle-less
horse has found...

892
00:58:14,158 --> 00:58:15,866
...its way into
this morning's drawing.

893
00:58:18,037 --> 00:58:19,152
Mrs. Talmann...

894
00:58:19,622 --> 00:58:22,030
...why don't you
now leave the window...

895
00:58:22,834 --> 00:58:23,948
...and come to the basin.

896
00:58:24,627 --> 00:58:25,327
Don't worry...

897
00:58:25,545 --> 00:58:27,621
...your position of superiority
won't be diminished.

898
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:29,582
I will still have to look up to you.

899
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:36,045
Since I have taken valuable time...

900
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:38,387
...to fill this basin
with a little water...

901
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:40,677
...why not share it with me?

902
00:59:07,628 --> 00:59:09,787
You have a curious
mole, Mrs. Herbert...

903
00:59:10,381 --> 00:59:12,254
...and it is ideally placed.

904
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,791
Does your gardener
catch moles, Mrs. Herbert?

905
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:19,586
No, he says they
are to be encouraged...

906
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:23,140
...for good luck and the
destruction of one's enemies.

907
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:25,268
They trip up horses, Mrs. Herbert.

908
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:28,605
You will not persuade Mr.
Porringer to persecute them.

909
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:30,061
A curious man...

910
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:32,109
...and ideally placed.

911
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:33,943
Ideally placed for what?

912
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:36,610
Why for persuading
a fine white horse...

913
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:39,149
...from Southampton
to go lame in the leg.

914
00:59:44,665 --> 00:59:47,701
You have nothing to fear
from Mr. Porringer, Mr. Neville.

915
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:51,210
He watches you for his own amusement.

916
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:52,998
As I do you, Madam.

917
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:57,876
You seem nonetheless to be curiously
keen to protect your gardener.

918
00:59:58,428 --> 00:59:59,258
It is not you...

919
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:01,510
...but his breeches
that are his best defence.

920
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:04,886
A man in red breeches
could scarcely be considered...

921
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:07,058
...an inconspicuous conspirator.

922
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:11,768
Unlike that other fool who behaves
like a statue when you least expect.

923
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:28,328
Away from the house, Mr. Neville...

924
01:00:29,624 --> 01:00:32,376
...I feel I grow
smaller in significance.

925
01:00:34,254 --> 01:00:37,208
Madam, what signifies,
does not grow smaller for me.

926
01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:41,506
Your significance Mr. Neville
is attributable to both...

927
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,555
...innocence and
arrogance in equal parts.

928
01:00:45,682 --> 01:00:48,469
You can handle both
with impunity, Mrs. Talman.

929
01:00:49,770 --> 01:00:52,640
But you will find that
they are not symmetrical.

930
01:00:53,649 --> 01:00:56,982
You will find that one
weighs heavier than the other.

931
01:00:59,029 --> 01:01:00,938
Which do you think is the heavier?

932
01:01:02,866 --> 01:01:04,526
Your innocence, Mr. Neville...

933
01:01:05,077 --> 01:01:06,322
...is always sinister.

934
01:01:07,954 --> 01:01:11,537
So I will say that the
right one is the heaviest.

935
01:01:11,749 --> 01:01:13,956
Your dexterity is admirable.

936
01:01:18,339 --> 01:01:20,747
You spend too much
time with Mr. Neville.

937
01:01:22,469 --> 01:01:23,215
How is that?

938
01:01:23,428 --> 01:01:25,053
The man is a pariah.

939
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,515
He eats like a vagrant
and dresses like a barber.

940
01:01:29,684 --> 01:01:30,847
What compliments.

941
01:01:31,353 --> 01:01:32,551
I think he would be amused.

942
01:01:32,771 --> 01:01:33,802
As for his servant...

943
01:01:34,022 --> 01:01:36,311
...he looks like a
fleece with a foot disease.

944
01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:40,067
Don't you think
Mr. Neville is knowledgeable?

945
01:01:40,278 --> 01:01:41,192
About what?

946
01:01:43,615 --> 01:01:45,026
About what, Madam?

947
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:50,574
I could take your
silence as provocation.

948
01:01:51,330 --> 01:01:53,868
And why should I wish to provoke you?

949
01:01:54,208 --> 01:01:55,833
To excite me to think
that you might wish...

950
01:01:56,044 --> 01:01:58,036
...to compliment Mr.
Neville with more than praise...

951
01:01:58,254 --> 01:01:59,535
...for his knowledgability.

952
01:02:00,256 --> 01:02:01,881
The complexity of your
speech does you credit...

953
01:02:02,091 --> 01:02:04,582
...but it far exceeds the
complexity of any relationship...

954
01:02:04,802 --> 01:02:06,546
...I might have with Mr. Neville...

955
01:02:06,846 --> 01:02:08,388
...which is indeed very simple.

956
01:02:09,307 --> 01:02:11,549
He's a paid servant of my mother's...

957
01:02:11,893 --> 01:02:13,056
...bound by a contract.

958
01:02:13,269 --> 01:02:14,218
That is all.

959
01:02:15,105 --> 01:02:17,181
I'm encouraged by my
mother to see him honour it.

960
01:02:17,399 --> 01:02:20,234
Is his pleasure in your
encouragement so necessary?

961
01:02:20,568 --> 01:02:22,561
Although Mr. Neville has qualities...

962
01:02:22,862 --> 01:02:24,939
...he is neither as intelligent nor...

963
01:02:25,155 --> 01:02:26,650
...as talented as he thinks.

964
01:02:27,283 --> 01:02:30,284
Both characteristics you have
observed from the start, Louis.

965
01:02:31,078 --> 01:02:33,534
Though I admit more by
prejudice than by observation.

966
01:02:45,134 --> 01:02:48,219
I understand that you will be
leaving us tonight, Mr. Neville.

967
01:02:49,013 --> 01:02:50,128
With Mrs. Herbert's permission...

968
01:02:50,348 --> 01:02:52,803
...I will be leaving after
the arrival of Mr. Herbert...

969
01:02:53,017 --> 01:02:56,102
...and after he has passed an
opinion on the drawings of his house.

970
01:02:56,813 --> 01:02:58,936
If my servant has
obtained a vehicle...

971
01:02:59,148 --> 01:03:00,856
...I will be leaving in the morning.

972
01:03:01,067 --> 01:03:03,688
And, of course, Mr.
Neville, the sooner the better...

973
01:03:03,902 --> 01:03:05,444
...as you expected me to say.

974
01:03:05,654 --> 01:03:08,608
You Sir, have acquainted me
with your opinion on drawing...

975
01:03:08,949 --> 01:03:11,867
...on horticulture, the
Roman church, childbearing...

976
01:03:12,161 --> 01:03:14,699
...the place of women in
English life, the history...

977
01:03:14,913 --> 01:03:17,950
...and politics of
Lubeck, and the training of dogs.

978
01:03:18,167 --> 01:03:19,875
So I am in a fair position...

979
01:03:20,085 --> 01:03:22,755
...to anticipate your
opinions to my departure.

980
01:03:22,963 --> 01:03:26,629
Is Radstock to greet you
with such devoted hospitality?

981
01:03:26,926 --> 01:03:28,040
Mr. Talmann...

982
01:03:29,011 --> 01:03:31,335
...I have been treated
with as great hospitality...

983
01:03:31,721 --> 01:03:34,047
...as I could wish for
in Mrs. Herbert's house.

984
01:03:45,651 --> 01:03:49,316
Your drawings are full of the most
unexpected observation, Mr. Neville.

985
01:03:49,572 --> 01:03:52,775
Looking at them is a kin to
pursuing a complicated allegory.

986
01:03:53,242 --> 01:03:55,567
Are you sure this ladder was there?
- Indisputably.

987
01:03:55,786 --> 01:03:58,194
And what's this? It looks like...
- Whatever it is, it was there.

988
01:03:58,414 --> 01:04:00,074
Mrs. Talisman will confirm it.

989
01:04:00,416 --> 01:04:01,365
How is that?

990
01:04:01,751 --> 01:04:03,210
How will my wife confirm it?

991
01:04:03,419 --> 01:04:06,373
Mr. Neville is probably too
encompassing in his statement.

992
01:04:06,881 --> 01:04:09,550
I can, however, confirm
the sighting of a ladder.

993
01:04:10,301 --> 01:04:12,923
It is propped against my father's
with drawing-room.

994
01:04:13,429 --> 01:04:14,509
It is indeed Madam.

995
01:04:14,722 --> 01:04:16,181
You have an exact knowledge.

996
01:04:16,516 --> 01:04:18,224
As exact a knowledge as though...

997
01:04:18,685 --> 01:04:20,927
...you had placed it
there yourself, would you say?

998
01:04:21,603 --> 01:04:24,094
Mr. Neville, if ever I had
such a mind to...

999
01:04:24,314 --> 01:04:26,888
...I would have found it
impossible to have lifted it.

1000
01:04:27,443 --> 01:04:28,438
It would have taken...

1001
01:04:28,861 --> 01:04:29,607
...two men.

1002
01:04:31,030 --> 01:04:31,978
Away!

1003
01:04:37,703 --> 01:04:39,411
What do you want, Mr. Clarke?

1004
01:04:39,622 --> 01:04:41,116
Can you come with me, Sir.

1005
01:04:41,624 --> 01:04:42,489
It's important.

1006
01:05:46,855 --> 01:05:48,563
It is most important that
I speak with you.

1007
01:05:48,773 --> 01:05:50,018
I cannot now, Thomas.

1008
01:05:50,358 --> 01:05:51,853
I am in a position to insist.

1009
01:05:52,068 --> 01:05:54,559
After what has happened,
I refuse to speak to you now.

1010
01:05:55,447 --> 01:05:56,562
Take care of affairs yourself...

1011
01:05:56,782 --> 01:05:58,608
...or in the last resort,
ask Mr. Talmann.

1012
01:05:58,867 --> 01:06:01,654
Telling Mr. Talman what is on my
mind will not help you.

1013
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:02,819
What do you mean?

1014
01:06:03,497 --> 01:06:06,617
I am sure I'm shortly to be accused
of the murder of your husband.

1015
01:06:07,501 --> 01:06:10,537
I'm determined to confront that
eventuality well protected.

1016
01:06:11,588 --> 01:06:12,751
Who will accuse you?

1017
01:06:13,173 --> 01:06:14,965
Firstly, I think will be
your son-in-law...

1018
01:06:15,843 --> 01:06:18,167
...abetted and witnessed
probably by his servants.

1019
01:06:18,386 --> 01:06:20,711
How can that be?
- I need your assistance.

1020
01:06:20,930 --> 01:06:21,844
To what end?

1021
01:06:22,682 --> 01:06:26,098
If my son-in-law believes that you're
guilty of the murder of Mr. Herbert.

1022
01:06:28,771 --> 01:06:29,637
Leave me.

1023
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:33,063
Maria!

1024
01:06:33,276 --> 01:06:34,983
Calling your servants
is not going to help.

1025
01:06:35,194 --> 01:06:36,937
What do you mean?
Maria!

1026
01:06:37,196 --> 01:06:38,820
I mean the draughtsman's contract.

1027
01:06:39,031 --> 01:06:39,861
What of it?

1028
01:06:40,074 --> 01:06:41,568
Maria, call Mr. Talmann.

1029
01:06:41,784 --> 01:06:44,322
I mean your contractual
obligations to Mr. Neville.

1030
01:06:45,454 --> 01:06:46,450
What of them?

1031
01:06:46,664 --> 01:06:48,656
You are disingenuous beyond words.

1032
01:06:50,167 --> 01:06:51,496
Don't bother to call Mr. Talmann.

1033
01:06:51,710 --> 01:06:52,909
Fetch me instead a...

1034
01:06:54,839 --> 01:06:57,376
Fetch me nothing.
I'm not thirsty just at present.

1035
01:07:04,514 --> 01:07:05,344
Now...

1036
01:07:05,932 --> 01:07:08,258
...Mr. Noyes,
what are you inferring?

1037
01:07:08,977 --> 01:07:11,266
I am to be unjustly and
unscrupulously accused...

1038
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:12,974
...of the murder of your husband.

1039
01:07:13,315 --> 01:07:14,513
On what grounds?

1040
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:17,391
That I was the most
likely person to have done it.

1041
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:20,528
I was the only person,
except your servants...

1042
01:07:20,739 --> 01:07:22,981
...to know of Mr.
Herbert's return on Friday.

1043
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:26,485
I am culpable because of my known
feelings towards your husband.

1044
01:07:26,787 --> 01:07:28,779
That is ridiculous, there was...

1045
01:07:28,997 --> 01:07:31,915
I am the only person in the group of
people you are about to mention...

1046
01:07:32,126 --> 01:07:34,913
...who was not at home
awaiting the arrival of Mr. Herbert.

1047
01:07:35,129 --> 01:07:38,164
And, further, because of my known
feelings towards you.

1048
01:07:41,134 --> 01:07:43,340
Is all that sufficient reason?

1049
01:07:43,803 --> 01:07:44,752
There is more.

1050
01:07:45,847 --> 01:07:47,638
Mr. Herbert's study is
mysteriously littered...

1051
01:07:47,849 --> 01:07:50,055
...with papers and
my gloves are there.

1052
01:07:50,894 --> 01:07:52,637
Now against this conspiracy...

1053
01:07:53,229 --> 01:07:54,854
...I need your protection...

1054
01:07:55,565 --> 01:07:56,561
...and more.

1055
01:07:59,194 --> 01:08:01,400
If you're guilty,
Thomas, you shall have neither.

1056
01:08:01,738 --> 01:08:02,687
With Mr. Neville's contract...

1057
01:08:02,906 --> 01:08:04,186
...I shall have them both.

1058
01:08:05,158 --> 01:08:07,566
For your protection and
for seven hundred guineas...

1059
01:08:08,328 --> 01:08:10,736
...I will trade you the
contract of your infidelities.

1060
01:08:12,874 --> 01:08:14,451
I have no money.

1061
01:08:15,293 --> 01:08:16,953
Seven hundred is a calculated sum.

1062
01:08:20,798 --> 01:08:23,550
I will trade you the
contract for the drawings.

1063
01:08:25,428 --> 01:08:26,590
You have 12 drawings...

1064
01:08:26,804 --> 01:08:28,761
...and Mr. Neville has a reputation.

1065
01:08:29,015 --> 01:08:31,221
What for 12 drawings
executed privately?

1066
01:08:31,768 --> 01:08:32,717
Consider, Madam.

1067
01:08:32,935 --> 01:08:35,308
The drawings could be construed
as an embarrassment to you.

1068
01:08:35,521 --> 01:08:36,932
And the original purpose
and significance...

1069
01:08:37,148 --> 01:08:40,897
...of the drawings as a
gift to your husband is absolved.

1070
01:08:41,736 --> 01:08:43,396
Those drawings, Mr. Noyes...

1071
01:08:44,405 --> 01:08:46,066
...have cost me too much already.

1072
01:08:46,574 --> 01:08:48,448
They may cost you a great deal more.

1073
01:08:49,703 --> 01:08:51,411
They may cost you possibly everything.

1074
01:08:52,122 --> 01:08:55,537
An adulteress with a dead husband
is no reputation to relish.

1075
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:57,865
And Mr. Neville?

1076
01:08:58,127 --> 01:09:00,001
What of Mr. Neville?
He's gone to Radcote.

1077
01:09:00,212 --> 01:09:01,706
What part is he in this stratagem?

1078
01:09:02,256 --> 01:09:03,798
He is not part of my stratagem.

1079
01:09:04,008 --> 01:09:07,293
He could be party to a future
arrangement with the same intent.

1080
01:09:08,387 --> 01:09:09,763
You paid him a fee, Madam...

1081
01:09:10,264 --> 01:09:13,965
...and you offered him full board on
your property during the commission.

1082
01:09:14,435 --> 01:09:17,140
To the prying eye that is
as much as he is usually worth.

1083
01:09:17,730 --> 01:09:19,557
With the contract in your
hand and then destroyed...

1084
01:09:19,774 --> 01:09:22,063
...why should the world
think you have offered him more?

1085
01:09:25,571 --> 01:09:26,947
Where is that contract now?

1086
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:27,814
I have it here.

1087
01:09:28,032 --> 01:09:29,147
Where are the drawings?

1088
01:09:29,659 --> 01:09:32,196
What would be said if I no
longer had the drawings?

1089
01:09:32,869 --> 01:09:34,198
That you destroyed them.

1090
01:09:34,746 --> 01:09:37,617
For without your husband
they were valueless to you.

1091
01:09:38,417 --> 01:09:39,792
What would happen
if it were known...

1092
01:09:40,002 --> 01:09:42,243
...that they were for sale?
Your stratagem is weak.

1093
01:09:42,462 --> 01:09:43,493
That you sold them...

1094
01:09:43,713 --> 01:09:46,833
...in order to afford a
memorial to your husband...

1095
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:48,331
...or alternatively...

1096
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:50,093
...that you sold them in
order to rid the house...

1097
01:09:50,303 --> 01:09:53,008
...of something which pains
you each time you look at them.

1098
01:09:55,391 --> 01:09:57,183
You once asked me if I could...

1099
01:09:57,393 --> 01:09:59,719
...supply you with a
ribald piece of gossip.

1100
01:09:59,938 --> 01:10:02,393
I remember your
friendly gesture at the time.

1101
01:10:05,068 --> 01:10:07,476
Madam, you Romans
know how to be charitable.

1102
01:10:11,949 --> 01:10:14,191
I can supply you with a
little more than gossip.

1103
01:10:15,202 --> 01:10:16,827
I invite you to help me...

1104
01:10:17,037 --> 01:10:19,196
...elaborate and
decorate such an item.

1105
01:10:19,457 --> 01:10:20,571
An entertaining item.

1106
01:10:21,459 --> 01:10:23,416
We need not work
too hard for the rump...

1107
01:10:23,627 --> 01:10:25,667
...of the matter has been well laid.

1108
01:10:26,088 --> 01:10:28,662
What real benefit do
you think I might gain...

1109
01:10:28,883 --> 01:10:30,081
...from this exercise?

1110
01:10:30,593 --> 01:10:31,589
Amusement...

1111
01:10:31,844 --> 01:10:34,549
...and a certain delight
in a symmetrical stratagem.

1112
01:10:35,515 --> 01:10:36,973
And the satisfaction
that our betters...

1113
01:10:37,183 --> 01:10:38,558
...might be discomforted.

1114
01:10:38,768 --> 01:10:40,048
And who knows, perhaps...

1115
01:10:40,645 --> 01:10:43,729
...two parterres and a
grove of orange trees.

1116
01:10:44,148 --> 01:10:46,106
If Mrs. Herbert is generous.

1117
01:10:46,651 --> 01:10:48,940
And why Mrs. Herbert?

1118
01:10:49,611 --> 01:10:52,363
Because I think you will
find she is mistress of strategy.

1119
01:10:53,031 --> 01:10:54,490
If you don't benefit
from her directly...

1120
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:56,408
...I think that, if you
wait a few years...

1121
01:10:56,618 --> 01:10:58,362
...then you will
achieve them from me...

1122
01:10:58,579 --> 01:11:00,073
...as a token of my esteem.

1123
01:11:01,707 --> 01:11:03,201
From the same source?

1124
01:11:03,459 --> 01:11:05,083
I think you have understood me.

1125
01:11:08,672 --> 01:11:10,380
A monument would need a designer.

1126
01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:12,592
Would a certain pecuniary
draughtsman...

1127
01:11:12,802 --> 01:11:14,628
...be eager to sign another contract?

1128
01:11:14,845 --> 01:11:17,253
As far as I am aware,
the idea is Mrs. Herbert's.

1129
01:11:17,473 --> 01:11:19,715
Though the expenses might
be laid at Mr. Neville's door.

1130
01:11:19,934 --> 01:11:21,013
An about face.

1131
01:11:21,686 --> 01:11:23,643
It is his drawings
that are to be sold.

1132
01:11:24,397 --> 01:11:25,559
Not more of his talent.

1133
01:11:26,190 --> 01:11:27,732
By Mr. Neville's growing
reputation...

1134
01:11:27,941 --> 01:11:29,850
...12 drawings could be
profitably sold...

1135
01:11:30,068 --> 01:11:32,227
...to furnish a more
solid and enduring monument.

1136
01:11:32,654 --> 01:11:35,441
It is said that Mr. Neville
is to be invited to The Hague.

1137
01:11:36,992 --> 01:11:38,569
If I had the wherewithal...

1138
01:11:38,785 --> 01:11:41,323
...I would advance Mrs.
Herbert one hundred guineas...

1139
01:11:41,538 --> 01:11:43,863
...straight away
for capital audacity...

1140
01:11:44,082 --> 01:11:46,656
...for bravura in the face of grief.

1141
01:11:46,919 --> 01:11:50,122
Mr. Herbert is no especial
excuse for such generosity.

1142
01:11:50,881 --> 01:11:53,123
But how publicly
directed is the gesture?

1143
01:11:53,592 --> 01:11:55,834
How could posterity
doubt her affection?

1144
01:11:56,053 --> 01:11:56,835
Just so.

1145
01:11:57,054 --> 01:12:00,221
I shall offer 300 guineas, not my
own money, you understand.

1146
01:12:00,432 --> 01:12:02,508
My father-in-law's can afford it...

1147
01:12:02,768 --> 01:12:05,769
...he collects, has no
perspicacity, no knowledge.

1148
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:07,224
I shall tell him...

1149
01:12:07,438 --> 01:12:08,767
...that they are Italian...

1150
01:12:09,065 --> 01:12:10,144
...Guido Reni...

1151
01:12:10,984 --> 01:12:12,015
...Modesta.

1152
01:12:13,069 --> 01:12:14,943
He shall hang them
in the darkroom...

1153
01:12:15,155 --> 01:12:16,863
...and they shall never be seen again.

1154
01:12:17,699 --> 01:12:18,564
That is a pity...

1155
01:12:18,950 --> 01:12:20,694
...for they are full
of illuminating details.

1156
01:12:20,911 --> 01:12:23,746
Mr. Neville moves forward in
Mrs. Herbert's susceptibilities...

1157
01:12:24,122 --> 01:12:27,123
...like a man pressing a
life-work by slow stages.

1158
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:31,045
Would there perhaps be an idea
in Mr. Neville's imagination...

1159
01:12:31,546 --> 01:12:34,168
...for a certain
contract to cap them all?

1160
01:12:34,508 --> 01:12:36,216
On horseback, a dashing St. George...

1161
01:12:36,426 --> 01:12:38,086
...looking like a Jacobite with...

1162
01:12:38,345 --> 01:12:41,381
With a palette for a shield
and quiver full of brushes...

1163
01:12:41,598 --> 01:12:43,757
...and a pen held
crosswise in his teeth.

1164
01:12:43,976 --> 01:12:45,848
With ink stained fingers.

1165
01:12:46,726 --> 01:12:47,925
What is in his fingers?

1166
01:12:48,395 --> 01:12:49,344
Unmentionable.

1167
01:12:50,439 --> 01:12:51,304
Another pen?

1168
01:12:52,149 --> 01:12:53,524
It's like a pen.

1169
01:12:53,775 --> 01:12:54,724
Is it a pen?

1170
01:12:55,193 --> 01:12:56,142
A little pen.

1171
01:12:56,361 --> 01:12:58,568
The pen is mightier than the sword.

1172
01:12:58,780 --> 01:13:00,405
We will forward 400 guineas...

1173
01:13:00,616 --> 01:13:03,107
...to this scabrous monument to a pen.

1174
01:13:03,327 --> 01:13:06,910
And our receipt will be Mr. Neville's
drawing in the bath-house.

1175
01:13:07,122 --> 01:13:08,451
The one with the little dog.

1176
01:13:08,665 --> 01:13:09,780
Wagging its tail.

1177
01:13:11,043 --> 01:13:12,952
Mrs. Herbert does well to sell them.

1178
01:13:13,337 --> 01:13:14,748
How much will they bring?

1179
01:13:14,964 --> 01:13:17,289
They are worth what
those who buy them wish to pay.

1180
01:13:17,508 --> 01:13:20,841
Mr. Seymour has tentatively
offered four hundred guineas.

1181
01:13:21,637 --> 01:13:24,045
I am inclined to think that
he makes his offer generous...

1182
01:13:24,264 --> 01:13:28,308
...to Mrs. Herbert in order to
interest her in a larger and...

1183
01:13:28,810 --> 01:13:30,055
...a grander sale.

1184
01:13:30,270 --> 01:13:31,219
What other sale?

1185
01:13:31,563 --> 01:13:33,223
Why, of course, of the house.

1186
01:13:33,732 --> 01:13:35,309
That was very forward to him.

1187
01:13:35,901 --> 01:13:38,570
I tested his ambition by suggesting...

1188
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:41,442
...that he might buy a set
of distinguished drawings of it.

1189
01:13:41,656 --> 01:13:45,156
Either way is a useful way
to help Mrs. Herbert to a...

1190
01:13:45,410 --> 01:13:46,904
...more profitable bargain...

1191
01:13:47,162 --> 01:13:49,487
...and thereby to help
her demonstrate her loss...

1192
01:13:49,706 --> 01:13:52,114
...in the knowledge that
a larger sum would make...

1193
01:13:52,376 --> 01:13:54,285
...for a larger
monument for her husband.

1194
01:13:54,753 --> 01:13:56,627
Mr. Herbert, one way or another...

1195
01:13:56,838 --> 01:13:59,211
...stands to benefit
by Mr. Neville's industry.

1196
01:13:59,550 --> 01:14:00,712
As do we all.

1197
01:14:01,426 --> 01:14:04,426
I fail to see, for a start, my
benefit, or for that matter, yours.

1198
01:14:04,637 --> 01:14:06,879
Mr. Talmann, you are disingenuous.

1199
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:09,384
You as by your leave...

1200
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,926
...your future son's
future guardian...

1201
01:14:12,186 --> 01:14:13,681
...stand in an enviable position.

1202
01:14:13,897 --> 01:14:15,723
Consider the neatness of it.

1203
01:14:16,357 --> 01:14:18,931
The estate would have
an endurable memorial...

1204
01:14:19,235 --> 01:14:22,153
...which is part of the landscape,
instead of 12 perishable items...

1205
01:14:22,363 --> 01:14:24,237
...which are mere
representations of it.

1206
01:14:24,449 --> 01:14:26,525
I fail to see why Mr.
Seymour's presumption...

1207
01:14:26,743 --> 01:14:28,617
...should gain him a
part of my son's inheritance.

1208
01:14:28,870 --> 01:14:29,985
Maybe there again...

1209
01:14:30,205 --> 01:14:32,411
...Mr. Seymour will
be doing you a favour.

1210
01:14:33,375 --> 01:14:34,121
What do you mean?

1211
01:14:34,334 --> 01:14:37,121
By taking away the possibility
of your son ever seeing them...

1212
01:14:37,504 --> 01:14:39,461
...when you have
one, as I'm sure you will.

1213
01:14:40,006 --> 01:14:41,465
Why should he not see them?

1214
01:14:41,675 --> 01:14:45,339
Because he might perceive
the allegorical evidence...

1215
01:14:45,553 --> 01:14:49,385
...in them which you might
be stubborn enough to deny.

1216
01:14:49,599 --> 01:14:51,971
Mr. Neville had no use for allegory...

1217
01:14:52,184 --> 01:14:54,936
...and I am unlikely to miss
what my son would appreciate.

1218
01:14:55,188 --> 01:14:57,939
An allegorical meaning
that might involve his mother.

1219
01:14:58,691 --> 01:15:01,775
What? My Wife? How is that?

1220
01:15:02,945 --> 01:15:05,781
It is fancifully imputed...

1221
01:15:06,032 --> 01:15:09,697
...that Mr. Neville saw
you as a deceived husband.

1222
01:15:13,248 --> 01:15:14,493
How was I deceived?

1223
01:15:22,256 --> 01:15:23,584
I've been convinced, Sarah...

1224
01:15:23,799 --> 01:15:25,673
...that you have been deceiving me.

1225
01:15:26,135 --> 01:15:27,759
What is the matter with your voice?

1226
01:15:27,970 --> 01:15:28,752
Damn my voice.

1227
01:15:28,971 --> 01:15:30,631
If you did, it would scare me less.

1228
01:15:31,182 --> 01:15:33,969
What's the matter with your face?
Your face, Louis, is very red.

1229
01:15:34,185 --> 01:15:35,809
No redder than your backside...

1230
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:38,096
...when Mr. Neville
had finished with it.

1231
01:15:41,776 --> 01:15:44,730
When your speech is as
coarse as your face, Louis...

1232
01:15:45,071 --> 01:15:48,190
...you sound as impotent by
day as you perform by night.

1233
01:15:48,407 --> 01:15:51,693
Night and Day your
behaviour has been coarse...

1234
01:15:51,952 --> 01:15:54,787
...and is no down in
corresponding black and white...

1235
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:57,950
...for all the world to peer
at, whether the sun shines...

1236
01:15:58,166 --> 01:16:00,205
...or the wind blows, hot or cold.

1237
01:16:00,418 --> 01:16:03,584
Your speech, Louis, is
becoming meteorological.

1238
01:16:04,463 --> 01:16:05,744
Explain your conceit.

1239
01:16:05,965 --> 01:16:08,670
It is no conceit but
Mr. Neville's drawings.

1240
01:16:08,885 --> 01:16:12,503
I was sure you believed Mr. Neville
incapable of complicated meaning.

1241
01:16:12,764 --> 01:16:13,795
What has he done now?

1242
01:16:14,015 --> 01:16:16,387
It is mostly what he has undone.

1243
01:16:16,601 --> 01:16:18,178
It seems to be your person.

1244
01:16:18,394 --> 01:16:21,229
I have no control over
Mr. Neville's drawings.

1245
01:16:21,856 --> 01:16:23,564
He draws what he pleases.

1246
01:16:23,775 --> 01:16:26,729
He is not paid to draw for his own
pleasure, nor for yours.

1247
01:16:26,945 --> 01:16:28,107
What makes you think he has done that?

1248
01:16:28,321 --> 01:16:29,815
The way it looks.
- How does it look?

1249
01:16:30,031 --> 01:16:32,071
The way the world sees it.
- The world!

1250
01:16:32,492 --> 01:16:35,446
There cannot be that many
people who have seen these drawings.

1251
01:16:35,662 --> 01:16:37,785
Who are these people
that represent the world?

1252
01:16:37,998 --> 01:16:39,407
Seymour, Noyes, the Poulencs.

1253
01:16:39,623 --> 01:16:40,572
What do they see?

1254
01:16:40,791 --> 01:16:42,499
Enough to delight them...

1255
01:16:42,918 --> 01:16:45,588
...to exercise their
tongues, to discuss patrimony.

1256
01:16:46,088 --> 01:16:47,333
Or the lack of it.

1257
01:16:48,215 --> 01:16:50,837
They see then what they
have long been searching for.

1258
01:16:51,051 --> 01:16:51,965
Do you think?

1259
01:16:53,012 --> 01:16:54,008
And that means?

1260
01:16:54,305 --> 01:16:57,638
An opportunity to braid
you for not producing an heir.

1261
01:17:00,895 --> 01:17:03,137
Woman, it takes two.

1262
01:17:03,648 --> 01:17:05,936
It does indeed, Sir.

1263
01:17:06,776 --> 01:17:08,400
You amaze me.

1264
01:17:09,570 --> 01:17:11,397
What has that to do with Mr. Neville?

1265
01:17:11,614 --> 01:17:13,986
I could ask you that.
- You did not. You asked Mr. Noyes.

1266
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,445
It was he who pointed it out to me.

1267
01:17:15,660 --> 01:17:18,232
With his long nose he could point
you in any way he wishes.

1268
01:17:18,453 --> 01:17:19,367
Madam...

1269
01:17:19,788 --> 01:17:21,247
...you'll look at those drawings...

1270
01:17:21,456 --> 01:17:22,619
...and you'll explain to me...

1271
01:17:22,833 --> 01:17:25,869
...why a ladder is
placed under your window...

1272
01:17:26,086 --> 01:17:29,171
...and why your revolting little dog
is outside the bath-house...

1273
01:17:29,381 --> 01:17:31,457
...and why your walking-clothes
casually decorate...

1274
01:17:31,675 --> 01:17:33,004
...the bushes of the yew-walk.

1275
01:17:33,218 --> 01:17:35,092
Your inventory,
Louis, is unlimited...

1276
01:17:35,512 --> 01:17:38,217
...like you long,
clean, white breeches.

1277
01:17:38,974 --> 01:17:42,011
But there is nothing of
substance in either of them.

1278
01:17:48,526 --> 01:17:49,521
Let me ask you.

1279
01:17:50,444 --> 01:17:53,481
Perhaps you can explain what your
boots were doing in the sheep-field.

1280
01:17:53,698 --> 01:17:56,104
They were not my boots.
- Why was your undershirt idling...

1281
01:17:56,324 --> 01:17:58,531
...on a hedge near
the statue of Hermes?

1282
01:17:58,743 --> 01:17:59,657
It was not my shirt.

1283
01:17:59,870 --> 01:18:00,901
Can you not see...

1284
01:18:01,121 --> 01:18:03,327
...the drift of this
domestic inquisition?

1285
01:18:03,957 --> 01:18:06,033
You are answering me
as I could answer you.

1286
01:18:06,251 --> 01:18:08,327
You cannot deny it is your dog.

1287
01:18:09,212 --> 01:18:11,454
And whereas, with
your final accusation.

1288
01:18:11,673 --> 01:18:14,508
You pursue the ambiguity
of an abandoned sunshade.

1289
01:18:15,052 --> 01:18:17,756
You are complete on paper...

1290
01:18:18,138 --> 01:18:20,297
...in a borrowed hat
and a borrowed coat...

1291
01:18:20,557 --> 01:18:23,179
...and a borrowed
shadow I shouldn't wonder.

1292
01:18:23,727 --> 01:18:26,598
Posing with your knees tucked in...

1293
01:18:26,855 --> 01:18:28,398
...and arse tucked out...

1294
01:18:28,899 --> 01:18:30,939
...and a face like a Dutch fig...

1295
01:18:31,318 --> 01:18:35,315
...and a supercilious Protestant
whistle, I shouldn't wonder...

1296
01:18:35,530 --> 01:18:37,569
...on your supercilious smug lips.

1297
01:18:39,159 --> 01:18:39,989
And Louis...

1298
01:18:40,660 --> 01:18:43,696
...you have always said that
Mr. Neville has no imagination.

1299
01:18:44,289 --> 01:18:45,783
He draws what he sees.

1300
01:18:47,375 --> 01:18:49,368
Whose patrimony were
you apeing then?

1301
01:18:50,211 --> 01:18:51,326
My father's?

1302
01:18:53,256 --> 01:18:55,463
The world knows that he is dead...

1303
01:18:57,468 --> 01:18:59,460
...and is not certain who killed him.

1304
01:19:01,263 --> 01:19:02,923
The world might peer
at those drawings...

1305
01:19:03,140 --> 01:19:05,347
...and ask what conspiracy
of inheritance...

1306
01:19:05,559 --> 01:19:07,219
...did Mr. Neville have for you.

1307
01:19:10,856 --> 01:19:12,896
You are disreputable.

1308
01:19:14,985 --> 01:19:18,934
You side with a tenant-farmer's son
against your husband.

1309
01:19:21,283 --> 01:19:24,367
You have married the grand-daughter
of an army victualler.

1310
01:19:26,163 --> 01:19:29,745
There is nothing that I have said
that suggests I side with Mr. Neville.

1311
01:19:30,626 --> 01:19:34,042
I hope you will agree that
he has been useful to us all.

1312
01:19:34,755 --> 01:19:36,332
What have you done with his drawings?

1313
01:19:36,548 --> 01:19:39,218
I've bought them for 600 guineas
and plan to destroy them.

1314
01:19:39,426 --> 01:19:41,051
It would be a pity to destroy them.

1315
01:19:42,304 --> 01:19:44,546
You are concerned that posterity...

1316
01:19:44,765 --> 01:19:46,307
...will know of your duplicity.

1317
01:19:47,059 --> 01:19:48,008
Louis...

1318
01:19:49,061 --> 01:19:51,552
...they contain
evidence of another kind.

1319
01:19:52,647 --> 01:19:56,063
A kind more valuable than that
seized upon by those titillated...

1320
01:19:56,276 --> 01:19:58,601
...by a scandal
that smears your honour.

1321
01:19:59,904 --> 01:20:02,146
Evidence that Mr.
Neville may be cogniscent...

1322
01:20:02,365 --> 01:20:03,741
...to the death of my father.

1323
01:20:51,998 --> 01:20:53,029
Good morning, Madam.

1324
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:54,949
Mr. Neville.

1325
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:57,123
Good morning, Sir.

1326
01:20:59,047 --> 01:21:00,210
Good morning.

1327
01:21:01,007 --> 01:21:04,459
Though the summer suddenly seems
past and the weather less than good.

1328
01:21:05,554 --> 01:21:07,677
What has brought you back
to Anstey so soon?

1329
01:21:07,889 --> 01:21:09,964
I thought our humble
estate had seen the last of you.

1330
01:21:10,182 --> 01:21:12,934
I am staying at Radstock with
the Duke of Lauderdale...

1331
01:21:13,144 --> 01:21:14,852
...and have come at the
invitation of Mr. Seymour...

1332
01:21:15,062 --> 01:21:18,811
...to find that curiously he is
out and most of his house is shut up.

1333
01:21:20,359 --> 01:21:23,894
Mr. Seymour is in
Southampton with my husband.

1334
01:21:26,073 --> 01:21:29,158
The funeral was three days ago
and they are discussing property.

1335
01:21:30,161 --> 01:21:32,533
It would seem then that
my visit is poorly timed.

1336
01:21:33,998 --> 01:21:36,287
May I ask after the
health of your mother?

1337
01:21:37,585 --> 01:21:39,792
Although my mother was
understandably disturbed...

1338
01:21:40,004 --> 01:21:42,080
...by my father's
death, she is now...

1339
01:21:42,924 --> 01:21:44,833
...from the knowledge that
her affection for my father...

1340
01:21:45,051 --> 01:21:46,676
...can never be reciprocated...

1341
01:21:47,178 --> 01:21:48,257
...at ease.

1342
01:21:48,679 --> 01:21:49,959
And what of yourself?

1343
01:21:50,889 --> 01:21:52,432
I am very well, Mr. Neville.

1344
01:21:53,142 --> 01:21:54,221
And we are thriving.

1345
01:21:54,852 --> 01:21:58,018
Mr. Van Hoyten is to
consider for us a new management...

1346
01:21:58,230 --> 01:22:00,768
...of the grounds in an
entirely fresh approach.

1347
01:22:01,442 --> 01:22:04,940
He has come at our
request to soften the geometry...

1348
01:22:05,153 --> 01:22:07,395
...that my father
found to his taste, and to...

1349
01:22:08,031 --> 01:22:11,898
...introduce a new ease
and complexion to the garden.

1350
01:22:13,078 --> 01:22:15,201
Mr. Van Hoyten has
worked in The Hague...

1351
01:22:16,498 --> 01:22:18,656
...and he has presented
Mr. Talmann with some novel...

1352
01:22:18,875 --> 01:22:21,627
...introductions which we
will commence next spring.

1353
01:22:23,255 --> 01:22:24,797
He is a draughtsman too.

1354
01:23:02,919 --> 01:23:04,662
Mr. Neville has come, Mother...

1355
01:23:05,296 --> 01:23:06,754
...as we both believed he might.

1356
01:23:07,548 --> 01:23:10,335
He has brought with him
a rare gift from Radstock.

1357
01:23:11,093 --> 01:23:13,631
Three pomegranates from
Lauderdale's gardener...

1358
01:23:14,179 --> 01:23:16,967
...reared in English
soil under an English sun.

1359
01:23:17,182 --> 01:23:19,887
But with the help of one
hundred panes of glass...

1360
01:23:20,102 --> 01:23:22,427
...and half a year's
supply of artificial heat.

1361
01:23:23,105 --> 01:23:24,268
Thank you Mr. Neville.

1362
01:23:26,192 --> 01:23:28,184
We must see what we
can do for you in return.

1363
01:23:28,944 --> 01:23:31,518
I was about to take Mr.
Van Hoyten to the river.

1364
01:23:32,156 --> 01:23:33,864
He has plans to make a dam...

1365
01:23:34,575 --> 01:23:36,200
...and flood the lower field.

1366
01:23:37,453 --> 01:23:39,446
I will no doubt see
you later, Mr. Neville.

1367
01:23:44,001 --> 01:23:45,459
Flooded fields, Madam?

1368
01:23:46,878 --> 01:23:48,538
Do you plan to join Anstey to the sea?

1369
01:23:49,715 --> 01:23:51,423
We are to have an ornamental lake.

1370
01:23:52,467 --> 01:23:54,341
My son-in-law has ambitions
for his countrymen.

1371
01:23:54,553 --> 01:23:57,044
It is probably you
that has opened his eyes...

1372
01:23:57,264 --> 01:23:59,055
...to the possibilities
of our landscape.

1373
01:24:02,311 --> 01:24:04,553
Why is this Dutchman
waving his arms about?

1374
01:24:04,897 --> 01:24:06,355
Is he homesick for windmills?

1375
01:24:08,275 --> 01:24:09,224
Who knows?

1376
01:24:09,443 --> 01:24:10,606
He's a man with new ideas.

1377
01:24:10,819 --> 01:24:12,859
New ideas demand
new methods, perhaps.

1378
01:24:14,031 --> 01:24:15,146
How was Radstock?

1379
01:24:16,075 --> 01:24:17,154
Fine enough, Madam...

1380
01:24:18,202 --> 01:24:20,658
...but dull after the
excitements of Anstey.

1381
01:24:21,997 --> 01:24:24,369
Have you now come here
to renew those excitements?

1382
01:24:24,874 --> 01:24:26,369
That would be presumptuous.

1383
01:24:26,751 --> 01:24:27,914
It would indeed.

1384
01:24:28,712 --> 01:24:30,669
All contracts have been honoured...

1385
01:24:31,673 --> 01:24:33,298
...and the body has been buried.

1386
01:24:33,633 --> 01:24:34,796
That was blunt.

1387
01:24:36,261 --> 01:24:37,803
I remember that you were blunt...

1388
01:24:38,180 --> 01:24:39,674
...in your dealings with me.

1389
01:24:41,767 --> 01:24:43,012
I was glad to see Mrs. Talmann...

1390
01:24:44,061 --> 01:24:46,765
...and in all truth, put as
much a possibility as I could...

1391
01:24:46,980 --> 01:24:49,139
...to see that a meeting
with yourself might occur.

1392
01:24:49,942 --> 01:24:52,729
I was curious to see
the house and gardens again.

1393
01:24:52,945 --> 01:24:56,645
To see what appearance they'd put on
after this week of changing weather.

1394
01:24:57,407 --> 01:25:01,156
But I admit that it was
out of curiosity to see you...

1395
01:25:01,662 --> 01:25:02,859
...was behind the
reason for my wishing...

1396
01:25:03,079 --> 01:25:04,953
...to be invited to
Mr. Seymour's house.

1397
01:25:05,790 --> 01:25:07,070
Curiosity...

1398
01:25:08,042 --> 01:25:10,959
...dies bit sound a very
respectful reason to visit a lady.

1399
01:25:11,253 --> 01:25:12,996
Even one you've had the pleasure of.

1400
01:25:13,797 --> 01:25:17,249
Is it really myself that is the centre
of your interest and not my daughter?

1401
01:25:17,468 --> 01:25:18,463
Yes, Madam.

1402
01:25:20,804 --> 01:25:21,753
How's that?

1403
01:25:22,598 --> 01:25:24,721
My former contractual obligations...

1404
01:25:25,851 --> 01:25:28,769
...tied us together to my advantage,
and at your husband's death...

1405
01:25:28,979 --> 01:25:31,435
...it was again I who
gained and you who lost.

1406
01:25:33,067 --> 01:25:34,941
Very confident of that, Mr. Neville.

1407
01:25:35,403 --> 01:25:36,861
I must confess that in losing...

1408
01:25:37,071 --> 01:25:39,823
...you have excited
my curiosity further.

1409
01:25:42,617 --> 01:25:44,277
How do you imagine my losses...

1410
01:25:44,744 --> 01:25:45,740
...Mr. Neville?

1411
01:25:46,788 --> 01:25:47,951
Humiliations, Madam.

1412
01:25:48,290 --> 01:25:49,700
Each one exceeding the other.

1413
01:25:50,959 --> 01:25:53,450
Is losing a husband a humiliation...

1414
01:25:54,463 --> 01:25:55,494
...Mr. Neville?

1415
01:26:25,076 --> 01:26:27,235
In making my arrangements here...

1416
01:26:27,453 --> 01:26:30,075
...I concluded with the
possibility of 13 sites...

1417
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:31,867
...one of which had to be
rejected to comply...

1418
01:26:32,083 --> 01:26:33,827
...with the 12 drawings
as commissioned.

1419
01:26:34,252 --> 01:26:36,375
The site that was rejected was...

1420
01:26:36,713 --> 01:26:38,955
...as you will recall,
to the south of the house...

1421
01:26:39,174 --> 01:26:41,581
...and included the
monument to the horse.

1422
01:26:42,344 --> 01:26:44,835
It is the site where
your husband's body was found.

1423
01:26:46,515 --> 01:26:50,559
It was that irony that was
uppermost in enquiring minds...

1424
01:26:50,894 --> 01:26:52,721
...at the discovery
of Mr. Herbert's body.

1425
01:26:53,230 --> 01:26:55,057
The thirteenth site was rejected...

1426
01:26:55,273 --> 01:26:57,017
...for no clear reason.

1427
01:26:57,234 --> 01:26:59,272
It contained no view of the house...

1428
01:26:59,944 --> 01:27:02,269
...then that was true of
several other of the drawings.

1429
01:27:02,488 --> 01:27:05,774
It was the least characteristic of
the garden's viewpoints...

1430
01:27:06,284 --> 01:27:09,783
...and was most powerful at the
least advantageous times of day.

1431
01:27:09,996 --> 01:27:12,913
And that is why,
with your permission...

1432
01:27:14,042 --> 01:27:15,619
...I would like, if I may...

1433
01:27:16,753 --> 01:27:19,540
...to attempt to accomplish
that drawing this afternoon.

1434
01:27:19,756 --> 01:27:21,665
That is, if you have no objection.

1435
01:27:23,426 --> 01:27:24,375
Mr. Neville...

1436
01:27:24,969 --> 01:27:27,674
...your approach is full
of hesitant pleasantries.

1437
01:27:28,139 --> 01:27:31,674
That is because I am
still unable to fully judge...

1438
01:27:31,893 --> 01:27:34,514
...your present
feelings as to past events.

1439
01:27:51,787 --> 01:27:55,488
Mr. Neville, suffice it to say that
the object of my life has changed.

1440
01:27:55,833 --> 01:27:58,122
I am a widow whereas I was a wife.

1441
01:27:58,961 --> 01:28:01,713
It could be construed that I
was a widow whilst being a wife.

1442
01:28:02,965 --> 01:28:06,085
I've only exchanged a false
position that made me unhappy for...

1443
01:28:06,594 --> 01:28:07,543
...a true position...

1444
01:28:08,304 --> 01:28:10,048
...that has left me
without any emotion.

1445
01:28:12,058 --> 01:28:14,051
Mr. Neville, I propose to eat...

1446
01:28:16,561 --> 01:28:19,846
...and I propose that
you should eat with me.

1447
01:28:20,773 --> 01:28:21,971
When we are ready...

1448
01:28:23,151 --> 01:28:26,436
...I will show, along with
my gardener, Mr. Porringer...

1449
01:28:26,654 --> 01:28:28,861
...what we at Anstey
are capable of cultivating.

1450
01:28:29,198 --> 01:28:32,733
It will be by way of
returning your gift in kind.

1451
01:28:33,786 --> 01:28:36,159
And, who knows? It may
be that we could revive...

1452
01:28:37,123 --> 01:28:38,286
...one more time...

1453
01:28:39,042 --> 01:28:42,327
...a liaison,
outside of a contract...

1454
01:28:42,796 --> 01:28:46,496
...to our mutual satisfaction.

1455
01:28:48,259 --> 01:28:50,585
Then you must accomplish
your thirteenth drawing.

1456
01:28:50,804 --> 01:28:52,428
Is all that acceptable to you?

1457
01:28:52,639 --> 01:28:54,715
It is as if you'd planed it.

1458
01:28:55,683 --> 01:28:57,426
I'm surprised...

1459
01:28:57,852 --> 01:28:58,931
...delighted.

1460
01:28:59,562 --> 01:29:00,807
I am overwhelmed.

1461
01:29:01,021 --> 01:29:03,726
Mr. Neville, I will take
all three states...

1462
01:29:04,442 --> 01:29:06,434
...of your satisfaction
into consideration.

1463
01:29:07,403 --> 01:29:08,482
I have...

1464
01:29:09,739 --> 01:29:11,862
...quite legitimately,
a freedom to exploit...

1465
01:29:12,867 --> 01:29:15,025
...and I might as well
exploit it with you...

1466
01:29:16,078 --> 01:29:17,952
...considering our past experience.

1467
01:30:07,296 --> 01:30:08,707
A pomegranate, Mr. Neville.

1468
01:30:10,049 --> 01:30:12,919
Gift of Hades to Persephone.

1469
01:30:14,010 --> 01:30:16,086
My scholarship is not profound.

1470
01:30:17,597 --> 01:30:19,507
Unusual of you, Mr. Neville...

1471
01:30:20,142 --> 01:30:22,680
...to profess to an ignorance of
a subject which before...

1472
01:30:23,645 --> 01:30:25,804
...you would be anxious to
have us believe was an essential...

1473
01:30:26,023 --> 01:30:28,229
...prerequisite to
an artist's vocabulary.

1474
01:30:28,442 --> 01:30:32,274
Maybe I am hesitating to
acknowledge an unintended allusion.

1475
01:30:34,782 --> 01:30:37,154
By eating the fruit
of the pomegranate...

1476
01:30:39,953 --> 01:30:43,204
...Pluto kept Persephone
in the Underworld.

1477
01:30:43,791 --> 01:30:45,914
A symbolic fruit, Mrs. Herbert.

1478
01:30:46,335 --> 01:30:47,580
And you've brought me three.

1479
01:30:47,878 --> 01:30:50,250
That was all that Mr.
Clancy would spare me.

1480
01:30:52,257 --> 01:30:55,590
Maybe Mr. Clancy is a
contriver of allusions.

1481
01:30:56,761 --> 01:30:58,042
How is that Mrs. Herbert?

1482
01:30:58,263 --> 01:30:59,971
Are you acquainted with the man?

1483
01:31:00,765 --> 01:31:04,633
Having been tricked into
eating the fruit of the pomegranate...

1484
01:31:06,146 --> 01:31:09,894
...Persephone was forced to spend
a period of each year underground.

1485
01:31:11,401 --> 01:31:14,438
During which time, as even
Mr. Porringer will tell you...

1486
01:31:15,655 --> 01:31:18,859
...Persephone's mother,
the goddess of fields...

1487
01:31:19,076 --> 01:31:21,316
...of gardens and of orchards...

1488
01:31:22,078 --> 01:31:24,948
...was distraught, heart-broken.

1489
01:31:26,457 --> 01:31:27,453
She sulks...

1490
01:31:28,334 --> 01:31:31,204
...and she refuses,
adamantly refuses...

1491
01:31:31,420 --> 01:31:33,792
...to bless the
world with fruitfulness.

1492
01:31:35,716 --> 01:31:37,673
Mr. Porringer and...

1493
01:31:38,552 --> 01:31:41,672
...your Mr. Clancy try hard...

1494
01:31:42,097 --> 01:31:44,553
...to defeat the influence
of the pomegranate...

1495
01:31:45,350 --> 01:31:48,268
...by building places like these.

1496
01:31:49,146 --> 01:31:50,142
Don't you think?

1497
01:31:51,482 --> 01:31:55,349
And having built them and stocked
them and patiently tended them.

1498
01:31:56,445 --> 01:31:57,560
What do they grow?

1499
01:31:58,364 --> 01:32:01,898
Why, the pomegranate?

1500
01:32:03,285 --> 01:32:05,741
And we are turned full circle again.

1501
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:10,874
Certainly a cautionary
tale for gardeners.

1502
01:32:11,501 --> 01:32:15,119
And for mothers with
daughters, Mr. Neville.

1503
01:32:16,506 --> 01:32:19,080
Who knows?
Pomegranates grown in England...

1504
01:32:19,301 --> 01:32:21,839
...might not have such
unhappy allegorical significance.

1505
01:32:25,974 --> 01:32:29,723
Plants from the hot-house, according
to Mr. Porringer, are seldom fertile.

1506
01:32:30,896 --> 01:32:32,604
Fertile enough, Mrs. Talmann...

1507
01:32:33,190 --> 01:32:36,606
...to engender felicitous allusions
if not their own offspring.

1508
01:32:36,818 --> 01:32:38,811
And, of course, there are more.

1509
01:32:39,238 --> 01:32:40,400
More of what?

1510
01:32:41,490 --> 01:32:45,404
We well know your
delight in the visual conceit.

1511
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:49,443
The juice of the pomegranate...

1512
01:32:50,331 --> 01:32:52,324
...may be taken for...

1513
01:32:53,918 --> 01:32:54,997
...blood...

1514
01:32:56,129 --> 01:32:59,083
...and in particular
the blood of the new born...

1515
01:33:00,717 --> 01:33:02,092
...and of murder.

1516
01:33:04,012 --> 01:33:06,088
Then thanks to your
botanical scholarship...

1517
01:33:06,806 --> 01:33:09,891
...you must find it cruelly apt that I
was persuaded to bring such fruit.

1518
01:33:10,101 --> 01:33:11,216
Mr. Neville...

1519
01:33:11,561 --> 01:33:14,017
...I suspected you were
innocent in the insight...

1520
01:33:15,023 --> 01:33:17,312
...as you have been
innocent of much else.

1521
01:33:19,152 --> 01:33:20,066
Innocent, Madam?

1522
01:33:21,446 --> 01:33:24,116
By impute I was convinced
you thought me guilty...

1523
01:33:24,699 --> 01:33:26,110
...certainly of opportunism.

1524
01:33:26,617 --> 01:33:27,648
Probably of murder.

1525
01:33:29,328 --> 01:33:31,120
What I do think you guilty of...

1526
01:33:31,747 --> 01:33:33,621
...I do not at all reproach you for.

1527
01:33:35,459 --> 01:33:37,037
In our need of an heir...

1528
01:33:38,838 --> 01:33:41,839
...you may very
likely have served us well.

1529
01:33:44,469 --> 01:33:45,382
Madam?

1530
01:33:48,431 --> 01:33:50,305
We had a contract, did we not?

1531
01:33:54,604 --> 01:33:56,810
You do not think I
would have signed so much...

1532
01:33:57,023 --> 01:33:58,221
...for pleasures alone?

1533
01:34:05,656 --> 01:34:06,486
Madam...

1534
01:34:07,283 --> 01:34:08,362
...that was ingenious.

1535
01:34:08,575 --> 01:34:09,489
No.

1536
01:34:10,452 --> 01:34:12,492
Since when has
adultery been ingenious?

1537
01:34:13,956 --> 01:34:15,616
Mr. Neville you are ridiculous.

1538
01:34:32,599 --> 01:34:34,592
And why should you
have murdered Mr. Herbert?

1539
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:36,592
For what reason?

1540
01:34:37,145 --> 01:34:39,601
Mr. Talmann believes
I had reason enough.

1541
01:34:40,023 --> 01:34:42,597
Yes, Mr. Talmann is in Southampton...

1542
01:34:42,818 --> 01:34:44,856
...still trying to find or invent...

1543
01:34:45,069 --> 01:34:47,227
...some responsibility for
you in the matter.

1544
01:34:48,197 --> 01:34:50,949
He will not forgive
your indiscretion with Sarah.

1545
01:34:52,368 --> 01:34:54,159
But he won't disown
his wife, for then...

1546
01:34:54,370 --> 01:34:55,912
...he would lose Anstey.

1547
01:34:57,331 --> 01:34:59,905
I am sure that Mr. Talmann
is not in Southampton...

1548
01:35:00,251 --> 01:35:03,288
...for did I not see him on the
carriage drive here this afternoon.

1549
01:35:04,255 --> 01:35:05,251
I think not.

1550
01:35:05,882 --> 01:35:08,289
He is in Southampton,
with Mr. Seymour.

1551
01:35:08,843 --> 01:35:11,548
I do not think that Mr. Seymour
can be in Southampton.

1552
01:35:12,347 --> 01:35:15,680
For he stopped my servant this
morning at Radstock to ask after me.

1553
01:35:15,892 --> 01:35:18,465
And on the understanding that
I had some hope of seeing you...

1554
01:35:18,687 --> 01:35:21,260
...was according to my
servant, more than pleased.

1555
01:35:21,648 --> 01:35:24,731
I am convinced that we
will see him this afternoon.

1556
01:35:25,317 --> 01:35:28,567
I confess I am surprised
if that is the case.

1557
01:35:29,196 --> 01:35:30,275
I will enquire.

1558
01:35:35,745 --> 01:35:36,610
Sarah...

1559
01:35:37,872 --> 01:35:40,410
...ask Mr. Porringer to
get Mr. Neville a chair.

1560
01:35:41,083 --> 01:35:43,491
He intends to make a
drawing for me in the garden...

1561
01:35:44,170 --> 01:35:45,450
...by that horse.

1562
01:35:47,548 --> 01:35:48,663
And, Sarah...

1563
01:35:49,884 --> 01:35:53,218
...ask Mr. Porringer to
bring Mr. Neville a pineapple.

1564
01:35:53,638 --> 01:35:55,298
A small one, they're sweeter.

1565
01:35:56,140 --> 01:35:58,548
You would care to try a
pineapple would you not?

1566
01:35:58,810 --> 01:36:00,268
I would be delighted.

1567
01:36:24,084 --> 01:36:25,994
Good evening, Mr. Neville.

1568
01:36:28,589 --> 01:36:29,585
Good evening, Sir.

1569
01:36:30,549 --> 01:36:33,467
And why, Mr. Neville, do
we find you here so late?

1570
01:36:34,470 --> 01:36:37,839
Surely the light is now
too poor to see adequately.

1571
01:36:38,391 --> 01:36:40,134
That is true. I am finished.

1572
01:36:40,684 --> 01:36:41,763
Good.

1573
01:36:43,478 --> 01:36:44,972
Perhaps I could see it?

1574
01:36:45,272 --> 01:36:47,145
If we had light,
that might be possible.

1575
01:36:47,607 --> 01:36:49,896
I'm sure we can find some light.

1576
01:37:09,213 --> 01:37:11,834
But it is not finished, Mr. Neville.

1577
01:37:12,508 --> 01:37:14,547
No, Mr. Talmann, it is not.

1578
01:37:15,761 --> 01:37:18,133
You may successfully
hide your face in the dark...

1579
01:37:18,347 --> 01:37:22,260
...but in England it is not
easy for you to hide your accent.

1580
01:37:22,475 --> 01:37:24,966
I did not think to hide
my identity for long...

1581
01:37:25,186 --> 01:37:27,808
...which even in the eyes of
the English is no especial crime...

1582
01:37:28,022 --> 01:37:30,858
...compared with the identity
you care to assume with such ease.

1583
01:37:31,067 --> 01:37:32,940
And what identity might that be?

1584
01:37:33,152 --> 01:37:35,109
The identity of a man
of some little talent...

1585
01:37:35,321 --> 01:37:39,401
...some dubious honour, a
proper dealer in contracts.

1586
01:37:39,742 --> 01:37:42,315
The identity of a man with an
eye to the improper pursuit...

1587
01:37:42,536 --> 01:37:43,947
...of dishonour to others.

1588
01:37:44,163 --> 01:37:46,654
You talk, Mr. Talmann, like
one who has learnt abroad...

1589
01:37:46,874 --> 01:37:49,412
...an archaic way of speaking
that became unfashionable...

1590
01:37:49,627 --> 01:37:51,750
...in England when my
grandfather was a young man.

1591
01:37:52,004 --> 01:37:53,878
My speech is in no way dependable...

1592
01:37:54,090 --> 01:37:56,332
...on your view of fashion.

1593
01:37:56,551 --> 01:37:58,756
We all know that in the
field of deeds and of talent...

1594
01:37:58,969 --> 01:38:00,878
...you in your field are an innovator.

1595
01:38:01,221 --> 01:38:03,427
That must be some sort
of flattery, Mr. Talmann.

1596
01:38:03,890 --> 01:38:05,883
Have your companions
also come to flatter?

1597
01:38:06,101 --> 01:38:09,055
We have come merely as
curious observers, Mr. Neville.

1598
01:38:09,688 --> 01:38:11,645
To wonder why after
so much has happened...

1599
01:38:11,857 --> 01:38:15,060
...you return to continue to fix
Mr. Herbert's property on paper...

1600
01:38:15,694 --> 01:38:17,687
...and chose to draw
this particular site?

1601
01:38:17,905 --> 01:38:20,775
I might be inclined to answer
those questions...

1602
01:38:21,283 --> 01:38:23,359
...if I didn't feel that the
truthful answers I would give...

1603
01:38:23,577 --> 01:38:25,534
...would in no way
be of interest to you.

1604
01:38:25,746 --> 01:38:29,080
It is our belief, Mr. Neville,
that in returning here...

1605
01:38:29,291 --> 01:38:32,660
...you are seeking a
codicil to your original contract.

1606
01:38:33,003 --> 01:38:35,874
A codicil of a more permanent
nature than the last one.

1607
01:38:36,465 --> 01:38:38,540
A lasting contract with a widow.

1608
01:38:38,758 --> 01:38:41,428
You speak, of course, Mr. Talmann,
like a disinherited man.

1609
01:38:41,970 --> 01:38:44,259
Uninterested in painting
or draughtsmanship.

1610
01:38:44,806 --> 01:38:47,131
Uninterested even in the
prospect of the estate...

1611
01:38:47,392 --> 01:38:48,934
...you covet from this position.

1612
01:38:49,561 --> 01:38:51,968
An ideal site for a memorial, perhaps.

1613
01:38:52,188 --> 01:38:54,514
Do you think Mr. Herbert
would have appreciated...

1614
01:38:54,733 --> 01:38:56,013
...the prospect of his estate?

1615
01:38:56,526 --> 01:38:58,270
As a landowner
yourself, Mr. Seymour...

1616
01:38:58,487 --> 01:38:59,685
...I leave you to judge.

1617
01:39:00,655 --> 01:39:03,277
For a man of property it is
a view that might be enviable.

1618
01:39:03,784 --> 01:39:06,025
Though I think you are
wrong to ascribe those...

1619
01:39:06,244 --> 01:39:07,869
...enviable thoughts to me.

1620
01:39:08,205 --> 01:39:10,079
Perhaps they should be ascribed...

1621
01:39:10,332 --> 01:39:13,250
...to my friend Mr. Noyes who
is I think standing beside me.

1622
01:39:13,752 --> 01:39:15,578
A custodian of contracts.

1623
01:39:16,045 --> 01:39:18,750
A man who was given
custody of private agreements...

1624
01:39:18,965 --> 01:39:20,293
...in black and white.

1625
01:39:20,967 --> 01:39:22,794
And how do you feel
that Mr. Herbert...

1626
01:39:23,011 --> 01:39:25,336
...felt about these
black and white contracts?

1627
01:39:27,599 --> 01:39:30,090
As his agent, his
bailiff, his notary...

1628
01:39:30,351 --> 01:39:32,391
...his one-time friend, the close...

1629
01:39:32,604 --> 01:39:34,810
...though not close
enough confidant of his wife.

1630
01:39:35,106 --> 01:39:37,644
I would have thought you would be
the best person to answer that.

1631
01:39:37,859 --> 01:39:41,442
It is curious that you
persist in asking me questions...

1632
01:39:41,655 --> 01:39:44,146
...which you are the most
suitably situated to answer.

1633
01:39:45,283 --> 01:39:48,035
It has occurred to me that you
might have advanced...

1634
01:39:48,245 --> 01:39:50,321
...Mr. Herbert the information
that was so discretionally...

1635
01:39:50,539 --> 01:39:52,033
...set down in black and white.

1636
01:39:52,874 --> 01:39:55,495
If he could have appreciated
what it stood for is another matter.

1637
01:39:55,709 --> 01:39:57,501
He was blind to so much.

1638
01:39:58,045 --> 01:40:00,168
Certainly blind to
considerable unhappiness.

1639
01:40:00,381 --> 01:40:02,374
Your understanding of
Mrs. Herbert's unhappiness...

1640
01:40:02,591 --> 01:40:05,343
...could in no way be
considered profound or relevant.

1641
01:40:05,553 --> 01:40:07,261
I had access to some considerable...

1642
01:40:07,471 --> 01:40:09,096
...observation of her state of mind.

1643
01:40:09,432 --> 01:40:11,674
You won't forget that I
was helped in that respect by...

1644
01:40:11,893 --> 01:40:13,684
...her daughter, your wife.

1645
01:40:13,936 --> 01:40:17,471
And was persistently
persuaded by both ladies...

1646
01:40:17,690 --> 01:40:19,315
...to undertake the
commission in the first place.

1647
01:40:19,525 --> 01:40:21,435
And they persuaded you with a view...

1648
01:40:21,653 --> 01:40:24,986
...that you might reconcile
differences and not plunder them.

1649
01:40:25,281 --> 01:40:27,357
I am in no way responsible...

1650
01:40:27,575 --> 01:40:29,034
...for Mr. Herbert's death.

1651
01:40:29,410 --> 01:40:30,988
The affair is a mystery to me...

1652
01:40:31,538 --> 01:40:33,529
...though I have suspicions
Mr. Talmann...

1653
01:40:33,747 --> 01:40:35,206
...Mr. Seymour, Mr. Noyes.

1654
01:40:35,416 --> 01:40:38,914
And if they were here, indeed of
Mrs. Herbert herself and Mrs. Talmann.

1655
01:40:39,294 --> 01:40:42,294
Ladies who both after all entered
willingly into their contracts.

1656
01:40:42,505 --> 01:40:46,633
Is that why, Mr. Neville, you
have just abused Mrs. Herbert further?

1657
01:40:53,975 --> 01:40:54,924
What a pity.

1658
01:40:57,228 --> 01:40:58,308
That was clever.

1659
01:41:00,357 --> 01:41:03,939
We now have a contract
with you, Mr. Neville...

1660
01:41:04,778 --> 01:41:07,351
...and under conditions
of our choosing.

1661
01:41:08,156 --> 01:41:11,406
The contract concerning
our present pleasure...

1662
01:41:11,618 --> 01:41:12,780
...has three conditions.

1663
01:41:13,202 --> 01:41:16,405
It would be best served when
you have removed your finery.

1664
01:41:17,123 --> 01:41:18,533
Take off you hat.

1665
01:41:20,126 --> 01:41:24,076
My hat has no contractual
obligations with anyone.

1666
01:41:31,054 --> 01:41:33,212
The contract's first condition...

1667
01:41:33,431 --> 01:41:34,890
...and there's no need
to write it down for you...

1668
01:41:35,099 --> 01:41:38,468
...will never see it,
is to cancel your eyes.

1669
01:41:43,316 --> 01:41:46,685
Since we have now deprived
you of your access to a living...

1670
01:41:47,403 --> 01:41:50,653
...this shirt on your back
will be of no value to you.

1671
01:41:50,864 --> 01:41:53,438
It may well dress a scarecrow
to frighten the crows.

1672
01:41:53,659 --> 01:41:56,067
Or be scattered about an estate...

1673
01:41:56,287 --> 01:41:57,911
...as ambiguous evidence...

1674
01:41:58,163 --> 01:42:00,073
...of an obscure allegory.

1675
01:42:00,291 --> 01:42:02,414
And the third condition
of your contract...

1676
01:42:02,793 --> 01:42:04,122
...concomitant to the other two...

1677
01:42:04,336 --> 01:42:05,250
...and legally binding...

1678
01:42:05,504 --> 01:42:06,915
...and efficiently undertaken...

1679
01:42:07,131 --> 01:42:08,411
...and for what is a
man without property...

1680
01:42:08,632 --> 01:42:09,628
...and foresight...

1681
01:42:09,842 --> 01:42:11,384
...is your death.
