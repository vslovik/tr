<seg id="1"> January 11th, at 2:30 PM. </seg>
<seg id="2"> You'll do your statement separately, this is ours. </seg>
<seg id="3"> ...following a verbal dispute in Brooklyn Bridge Park... </seg>
<seg id="4"> Zachary Cowan, age 11, and armed with a stick </seg>
<seg id="5"> struck our son, Ethan Longstreet, in the face. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In addition ot the swelling and bruising of Ethan's upper lip </seg>
<seg id="7"> this act also resulted in two broken incisors </seg>
<seg id="8"> including nerve damage to the right incisor </seg>
<seg id="9"> - "Armed"? </seg>
<seg id="10"> Armed. You don't like armed? </seg>
<seg id="11"> Michael, what could we say? Carrying? Holding? Carring a stick? </seg>
<seg id="12"> - "Carrying", yeah. - "Carrying a stick". </seg>
<seg id="13"> - "Carrying"... </seg>
<seg id="14"> It's ironic, we always thought the Brooklyn Bridge Park was so safe compared to Hillside. </seg>
<seg id="15"> - Ture. We always said, Brooklyn Bridge Park, fine. Hillside, no way. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Just goes to show you. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Hey, thank you so much for coming! </seg>
<seg id="18"> It's so much better than getting caught up in that adversarial mindset. </seg>
<seg id="19"> - Well we thank you, really. </seg>
<seg id="20"> - There's no reason we have to thank each other. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Luckily, some of us still have a sense of community, right? </seg>
<seg id="22"> Though the kids haven't got that notion straight yet. </seg>
<seg id="23"> - I mean our kid. - Right, our kid. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Those tulips are gorgeous. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Oh it's the little florist on Henry, you know, all the way up? </seg>
<seg id="26"> Oh right! </seg>
<seg id="27"> They fly the bulbs in straight from Holland, </seg>
<seg id="28"> - That a fact? - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="29"> - Do you know the one? All the way up. - Right, right. </seg>
<seg id="30"> What about the tooth with the damaged nerve? </seg>
<seg id="31"> Oh. Well they don't know. There's still some question about the prognosis. </seg>
<seg id="32"> -  Apparently, the nerve is not completely exposed. - Only part of it is exposed. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Right. There's a part that's exposed and a part that's still protected. </seg>
<seg id="34"> - So now, they're not going to devitalize it. - They want to give the tooth a chance. </seg>
<seg id="35"> We would so like to avoid root canal. </seg>
<seg id="36"> - Of course. - So there's an observation period while they give the nerve a chance to heal. </seg>
<seg id="37"> - Meantime, he's going to need caps. - You can't have implants until you're eighteen anyway. </seg>
<seg id="38"> You can't. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The permanent implants can only be done once you stop growing. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Naturally. I hope... I hope it all turns out all right. </seg>
<seg id="41"> We can only hope. </seg>
<seg id="42"> You know, he didn't want to tell on Zachary. </seg>
<seg id="43"> No, he didn't want to tell. </seg>
<seg id="44"> I mean it was incredible to see this child with no face left, no teeth... </seg>
<seg id="45"> And he just wouldn't talk. </seg>
<seg id="46"> I can just imagine. </seg>
<seg id="47"> He didn't want to tell on the kid. Like his friends would say he was a snitch. I mean let's be honest, Penelope, it wasn't only a sense of honor. </seg>
<seg id="48"> You could say that. But a sense of honor requires a social context. </seg>
<seg id="49"> So how did you finally get Zachary's name? </seg>
<seg id="50"> Well because we explained to Ethan that protecting this child was not going to help him. </seg>
<seg id="51"> We told him, if this kid thinks he can go on hitting people and getting away with it, why should he stop? </seg>
<seg id="52"> We told him that if we were that child's parents, we would absolutely want to know about this. </seg>
<seg id="53"> - Of course. - Yeah. Excuse me one second. </seg>
<seg id="54"> Yes Walter, thanks for getting back to me. </seg>
<seg id="55"> So it's in this morning's Journal. I'll read it to you. </seg>
<seg id="56"> "According to a study published by British journal Lancet...two Australian researchers have identified...neurological side effects of TW Pharma's anti-hypertension medication Antril... including impaired hearing and ataxia." </seg>
<seg id="57"> Who the hell does your press monitoring over there? </seg>
<seg id="58"> Yeah, you're in deep shit. </seg>
<seg id="59"> No, my problem is the A.S.M. You have an Annual Stockholders Meeting in two weeks. </seg>
<seg id="60"> - Sorry. - So you're like a... - An attorney. </seg>
<seg id="61"> - And yourself? - Houseware supply. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Penelope is a writer. She works part time in a bookstore, mostly art books and history books. </seg>
<seg id="63"> - A writer! </seg>
<seg id="64"> I co-wrote a volume about Sabean civilization. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Working from artifacts recovered when they resumed digs after the Ethiopia-Eritrea conflict. </seg>
<seg id="66"> And now I have a book coming out in January about the Darfur tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="67"> So you specialize in Africa. </seg>
<seg id="68"> I'm interested in that part of the world, yes. </seg>
<seg id="69"> - Do you have any other children? - There's Courtney, she is nine. </seg>
<seg id="70"> She's very angry at her father right now. He got rid of the hamster last night. </seg>
<seg id="71"> - You got rid of the hamster? - Yeah. Made such a racket at night. </seg>
<seg id="72"> Those things sleep during the day. </seg>
<seg id="73"> Ethan was going crazy, he couldn't stand the racket that hamster made. </seg>
<seg id="74"> I don't mind telling you, I've been wanting to get rid of the thing for the longest time. </seg>
<seg id="75"> So I thought, that's it. I took it out and left it on the street. </seg>
<seg id="76"> - You left it on the street? - I figured it was a gutter-sewer kind of animal. </seg>
<seg id="77"> But it was scared out of its wits, out there, on that sidewalk. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Truth is, they're not pets and they're not wild. Drop them in the middle of the forrest they're still unhappy. I mean where are you supposed to put them? </seg>
<seg id="79"> - You just left him outside? - Yeah, he did. </seg>
<seg id="80"> And then he tried to convince Courtney that the hamster ran away. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Which, of course, she was not buying. </seg>
<seg id="82"> - And this morning the hamster was gone? - Gone. </seg>
<seg id="83"> - And what about you? What do you do for a living? - I'm an investment broker. </seg>
<seg id="84"> Let me... I'll just gonna ask this directly. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Could Zachary apologize to Ethan? </seg>
<seg id="86"> Sure. It would be good if they talked. </seg>
<seg id="87"> He's got to apologize, Alan. He has to actually say he's sorry. </seg>
<seg id="88"> - Yeah, probably. - Well, is he sorry? </seg>
<seg id="89"> He didn't realize how serious it was. He's eleven years old. </seg>
<seg id="90"> - Eleven is not a baby. - It's not an adult either. </seg>
<seg id="91"> We didn't ask you, you want some coffee or tea? </seg>
<seg id="92"> Is there any cobbler left, Penny? She makes a mean cobbler! </seg>
<seg id="93"> - You got espresso? - We do! </seg>
<seg id="94"> - I wouldn't mind a cup. - A glass of water. Yeah. Espresso for me too, babe. And bring the cobbler. Come on, come on. </seg>
<seg id="95"> Please, please have a seat. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="97"> You got to taste this cobbler. </seg>
<seg id="98"> Where's the cobbler? </seg>
<seg id="99"> She put the cobbler in the fridge again. I don't know what language I should speak to her in. </seg>
<seg id="100"> - Nice couple. - Very. </seg>
<seg id="101"> They're nice, right? - You tell everybody I'm a writer? </seg>
<seg id="102"> - You are a writer. You wrote a book. </seg>
<seg id="103"> Good cobbler is not easy to make. </seg>
<seg id="104"> - What do you sell? - Decorative hardware. Door locks, handles, copper fittings. And kitchen equipment, pots and pans. </seg>
<seg id="105"> Is that a good living? You know, it's not like we had any banner years or anything. It was tough starting out. </seg>
<seg id="106"> But long as I'm out there every morning, with my catalog and my sample case, it's a living. </seg>
<seg id="107"> Although the cast iron roasting pans do pick up around the holidays. </seg>
<seg id="108"> When you saw the hamster was terrified, why didn't you bring it home? </seg>
<seg id="109"> - Cause I don't touch them. - You put it on the sidewalk. </seg>
<seg id="110"> It was in the cage. I flipped it over. No way I'm touching those things. </seg>
<seg id="111"> - Sugar? - No, no sugar. </seg>
<seg id="112"> - What kind of cobbler you make? - Appler and pear. </seg>
<seg id="113"> - Apple and pear? - Yeah, it's a little recipe of mine. </seg>
<seg id="114"> - Apple and pear, that's new to me. </seg>
<seg id="115"> - Apple and pear is a classic. - There's a trick to it. - Really? </seg>
<seg id="116"> You have to cut the pear thicker than the apple, because they cook faster. </seg>
<seg id="117"> - Oh, right! - She's not telling you the real secret. - Let them taste it. </seg>
<seg id="118"> - Very good, very good. - Delicious! - Gingerbread crumbs! </seg>
<seg id="119"> - Oh my god! It's just a souped-up recipe, his mother gave me this idea. </seg>
<seg id="120"> - Gingerbread, fantastic! </seg>
<seg id="121"> At least we get a new recipe out of this, right? </seg>
<seg id="122"> I wish my son didn't have to lose two teeth in the process. </seg>
<seg id="123"> Right, that's what I meant. - You have a novel way of expressing it. </seg>
<seg id="124"> - No. I... Excuse me. </seg>
<seg id="125"> Yeah, Walter. </seg>
<seg id="126"> No. No letters to the editor. </seg>
<seg id="127"> You'll just fan the flames. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Was it scheduled? Yeah... </seg>
<seg id="129"> What are these disorders? What's ataxia? </seg>
<seg id="130"> And in normal doses? </seg>
<seg id="131"> How long have you known this? And in all that time you haven't recalled it? </seg>
<seg id="132"> What are we talking about in revenues? Oh, oh, I see. </seg>
<seg id="133"> - Alan! We're all waiting for you. - Yeah, right. One second. </seg>
<seg id="134"> Dennis? </seg>
<seg id="135"> They've known about the risks for two and a half years. </seg>
<seg id="136"> An internal report, but no undesirable side-effects are firmly established No precautionary measures and they don't schedule a reserve. Nothing in the annual report. </seg>
<seg id="137"> Lack of balance, jerky gait, the works. Basically, you look like you're drunk. </seg>
<seg id="138"> Roughly half a billion in revenues. </seg>
<seg id="139"> You there? </seg>
<seg id="140"> Deny. </seg>
<seg id="141"> That dumbshit wanted us to write a letter to the editor. </seg>
<seg id="142"> No way we're writing a letter. </seg>
<seg id="143"> On the other hand, if we see this is getting picked up, we could do a press release. Like somebody's spreading false rumors two weeks out from the A.S.M. kind of thing. </seg>
<seg id="144"> He's calling me back. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Ok. </seg>
<seg id="146"> - I've been so busy, I hardly had time for lunch. </seg>
<seg id="147"> - Help yourself, help yourself. </seg>
<seg id="148"> Go on. </seg>
<seg id="149"> I know I have no manners. Where were we? </seg>
<seg id="150"> We were saying it would be so much nicer if me meet some other way. </seg>
<seg id="151"> - So this cobbler, your mother, huh? - His mother. </seg>
<seg id="152"> It's my mother's recipe but Pen made it. </seg>
<seg id="153"> - Your mother doesn't use apples and pears. - No. </seg>
<seg id="154"> - She's about to have an operation, poor thing. - Really? What for? </seg>
<seg id="155"> - Her knee. </seg>
<seg id="156"> She's going to get a polythylene and metallic prostheses. </seg>
<seg id="157"> She's wondering what's going to be left of it after the cremation. </seg>
<seg id="158"> Michael, that's mean. </seg>
<seg id="159"> She doesn't want to be buried with my father. She wants to be cremated, And put upstate next to her mother, who's all alone. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A couple of urns jabbering away on the shores of Lake Sebago. </seg>
<seg id="161"> We're very touched by how generous you're being. </seg>
<seg id="162"> We realize how you're trying to smooth things out here instead of making them worse. </seg>
<seg id="163"> - Please, it's the least we could do. - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="164"> No, come on. So many parents just take their kid's side, acting like children themselves. </seg>
<seg id="165"> If Ethan had broken two of Zachary's teeth, I'm thinking Alan and I might have had more of a knee-jerk reaction. </seg>
<seg id="166"> - I'm not sure we would see the big picture. - Sure you would. </seg>
<seg id="167"> She's right. I'm not so sure. You would. Because we all know it could have happened the other way around. </seg>
<seg id="168"> So what does Zachary say? How is he experiencing this? </seg>
<seg id="169"> He doesn't talk much. A little overwhelmed I guess. </seg>
<seg id="170"> But he realizes that he disfigured his schoolmate? </seg>
<seg id="171"> No. No, he doesn't realize that he disfigured his schoolmate. </seg>
<seg id="172"> Why do you say that? Of course Zachary realizes. </seg>
<seg id="173"> He realizes that this violent behavior is unacceptable, not that he disfigured his schoolmate. </seg>
<seg id="174"> You don't like the word but unfortunately the word is appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="175"> - My son did not disfigure your son. - Your son disfigured our son! </seg>
<seg id="176"> - Come back after school, look at his mouth and teeth. </seg>
<seg id="177"> - Momentarily disfigured. - His mouth will be fine when the swelling goes down. </seg>
<seg id="178"> As for the teeth, if he needs it, we'd be willing to chip in for the best dental care. </seg>
<seg id="179"> We got insurance for that. </seg>
<seg id="180"> What we want is for the boys to patch it up, make sure nothing like this ever happens again. </seg>
<seg id="181"> - Let's set up a meeting. - Yeah. Exactly. </seg>
<seg id="182"> - Should we be there? </seg>
<seg id="183"> - They don't need coaching. Let them work it out like men. Like men? Alan, don't be rediculous. </seg>
<seg id="184"> On the other hand, maybe we don't need to be there. Maybe it's better if we weren't there, right? </seg>
<seg id="185"> The issue is not whether we are there, whether we are not there. The issue is, do they want to talk about this, do they want to work this out. </seg>
<seg id="186"> - Ethan does. - Does Zachary? </seg>
<seg id="187"> - We won't give him a choice. - It has to come from him. </seg>
<seg id="188"> Zachary acts like a thug, we're not going to wait around for him to see the light. </seg>
<seg id="189"> If Zachary sees Ethan in a punitive context, because he's forced to, I just don't see anything positive coming out of that. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Mrs. Longstreet, our son is a maniac. If you hope he'll suddenly and spontaneously get all apologetic, you're dreaming. </seg>
<seg id="191"> Look, I'm sorry, but I really do have to get back to the office. Nancy, you stay. You'll let me know what was decided. I'm no use to anyone anyway. </seg>
<seg id="192"> Women think you need the man, you need the father, like it would do any good. </seg>
<seg id="193"> I'm really sorry, but I can't stay either. </seg>
<seg id="194"> My husband has never been much of an I'll-push-the-stroller type daddy. </seg>
<seg id="195"> That's too bad, because it goes by so fast. Mike really liked taking care of the kids. </seg>
<seg id="196"> - You had a ball pushing that stroller. - Yeah, sure. </seg>
<seg id="197"> So... What should we decide? </seg>
<seg id="198"> Could you come over to our place at about 7:30, with Ethan? </seg>
<seg id="199"> - Well, if you want my opinion... - Yes, please. </seg>
<seg id="200"> - I think Zachary should come over here. </seg>
<seg id="201"> The victim shouldn't be the one who makes the trip. </seg>
<seg id="202"> - I can't be anywhere at 7:30. - Who needs you? You're useless, right? </seg>
<seg id="203"> - Seriously, I think it's important for his father to come. - Not tonight! </seg>
<seg id="204"> - Can you hear me? </seg>
<seg id="205"> There's not a word in the annual report. But the risk wasn't officially established. There's no proof. Call me back. </seg>
<seg id="206"> - Tomorrow? - Tomorrow I'm in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="207"> - You have business in Washington? - At the Pentagon. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Look, the main thing is to get the kids to talk. </seg>
<seg id="209"> I'll come over to your place with Zachary at 7:30 and we'll let them talk it through. </seg>
<seg id="210"> What? You don't seem convinced. </seg>
<seg id="211"> If Zachary hasn't acquired accountability skills, They'll just glare at each other, it will be disaster. </seg>
<seg id="212"> - "Accountability skills", Mrs. Longstreet? What are you talking about? - Zachary is not a maniac. - Yes he is. </seg>
<seg id="213"> Alan, don't be an idiot. Why are you saying that? </seg>
<seg id="214"> He's a maniac. - How does he explain what he did? - He won't talk about it. </seg>
<seg id="215"> - He should talk about it. - That's a lot of "shoulds", Mrs. Longstreet. </seg>
<seg id="216"> He should come here, he should talk about it, he should feel sorry... </seg>
<seg id="217"> I'm sure you're much more evolved than we are. </seg>
<seg id="218"> We're trying to get up to speed, but in the meantime try to indulge us. </seg>
<seg id="219"> Hey come on! What happened here? </seg>
<seg id="220"> This isn't what we are all about. - I was talking about Zachary, about him. </seg>
<seg id="221"> - I got that. Alan! </seg>
<seg id="222"> You want some more coffee? Real coffee. Coffee. </seg>
<seg id="223"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="224"> - Coffee, all right. - It's OK, I'll get it. </seg>
<seg id="225"> I see you're an art enthusiast. Yes. </seg>
<seg id="226"> - Bacon? - Yes, Bacon. </seg>
<seg id="227"> - Cruelty and splendor. - Chaos. Balance. </seg>
<seg id="228"> - Is Zachary interested in art? - Not as much as he should be. - Your children are? </seg>
<seg id="229"> - We try to make up for the lack in the school curriculum. </seg>
<seg id="230"> We try to get them to read, to concerts and galleries. </seg>
<seg id="231"> I really believe that culture can be a powerful force for peace. </seg>
<seg id="232"> Yeah you're so right. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Is cobbler cake or pie? This is an important question. </seg>
<seg id="234"> I was in the kitchen, thinking. Why should pizza be a pie? </seg>
<seg id="235"> Cobbler is cake. It there's no crust on the bottom then it can't be pie. </seg>
<seg id="236"> You're a gourmet chef. I like to cook. </seg>
<seg id="237"> It's something you have to do out of love or not at all. </seg>
<seg id="238"> The way I see it, if there's no curst on the bottom, then it's not a pie. </seg>
<seg id="239"> How about you guys? You have other kids? </seg>
<seg id="240"> I have another son by a former marriage. </seg>
<seg id="241"> You know, I was wondering. I know it's not important but... </seg>
<seg id="242"> Do you know what were they arguing about? Cause Ethan won't say a word. </seg>
<seg id="243"> Ethan wouldn't let Zachary be part of his gang. - Ethan has a gang? </seg>
<seg id="244"> - And he called him a snitch. Did you know that Ethan had a gang? </seg>
<seg id="245"> No. But I'm thrilled to hear it! </seg>
<seg id="246"> - Why are you thrilled? - Cause I had one. - I was the leader. - So was I. </seg>
<seg id="247"> What does the leader of a gang do? </seg>
<seg id="248"> You know, you got five, six guys who like you and they're willing to sacrifice themselves for you. </seg>
<seg id="249"> - Like in Ivanhoe. - Exactly, like in Ivanhoe. </seg>
<seg id="250"> Who even knows Ivanhoe any more? So it's another role model. Like Spiderman or whoever. </seg>
<seg id="251"> Well apparently you know more about it than we do. </seg>
<seg id="252"> Zachary wasn't quite as silent as you first said. </seg>
<seg id="253"> Why did he call him a snitch? </seg>
<seg id="254"> Forget it, silly question, right? What's the point? No one care. </seg>
<seg id="255"> We're not going to get into these children's quarrels. </seg>
<seg id="256"> - It's none of our business. - Right. </seg>
<seg id="257"> What is our business is this unfortunate incident. Violence is our business. </seg>
<seg id="258"> When I was the leader, I beat up Jimmy Leach in a fair fight and he was bigger than me. </seg>
<seg id="259"> - What does that do with anything, Michael? - No, nothing. </seg>
<seg id="260"> This is not a fair fight, these boys weren't fighting. </seg>
<seg id="261"> - Right, I was just remembering something. - It's not very different. </seg>
<seg id="262"> - Excuse me, I'm sorry there's a difference. - There's a difference. </seg>
<seg id="263"> What's the difference? Jimmy Leach and me, we agreed to fight. </seg>
<seg id="264"> - Did you mess him up? - A little. </seg>
<seg id="265"> Enough about Jimmy Leach. - Do you mind if I talked to Zachary? </seg>
<seg id="266"> - Of course not. - I would not do it without your permission. </seg>
<seg id="267"> - No, talk to him. That's completely fine with us. - And good luck with that. </seg>
<seg id="268"> - Stop it. Why did you say that? </seg>
<seg id="269"> - Mrs. Longstreet... - Penelope. I think we'll do better if we're on a first name basis. </seg>
<seg id="270"> - Penelope, you're acting on a desire to educate... </seg>
<seg id="271"> - I won't talk to him if you don't want me to. Go ahead, talk to him, lecture him, do whatever you want. </seg>
<seg id="272"> I don't understand how you feel so uninvolved here. </seg>
<seg id="273"> - Mrs. Longstreet... - Penelope. </seg>
<seg id="274"> Penelope, I'm very involved here. - My son injured another child... </seg>
<seg id="275"> - Deliberately. See, that's the kind of thing that irks me. We know deliberately. </seg>
<seg id="276"> That's what makes all the difference. The difference between what and what? </seg>
<seg id="277"> We're only talking about one thing here. Our kid picked up a stick and hit your kid. That's why we're here, right? </seg>
<seg id="278"> - Fruitless. - Right, she's right. This kind of talk is fruitless. </seg>
<seg id="279"> Why do you feel you need to slip in the word deliberately? What kind of lesson are you trying to teach me? </seg>
<seg id="280"> All right, this is getting silly. </seg>
<seg id="281"> My husband is all stressed out over work stuff. </seg>
<seg id="282"> I'll come back here tonight with Zachary and we'll let them work it out naturally. </seg>
<seg id="283"> - I'm not stressed out in the least. - Well I am. </seg>
<seg id="284"> - There's no reason to be stressed out. - Yes, there is. Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="285"> Well, no comment...No comment. </seg>
<seg id="286"> No comment! </seg>
<seg id="287"> What? If you recall it, you're admitting liability! </seg>
<seg id="288"> Recalling Antril would be admitting your liability! </seg>
<seg id="289"> Christmas time in the school play... - What did Zachary play? </seg>
<seg id="290"> Zachary played... - Ebenezer Scrooge. - accused of accounting irregularities... - Ebenezer Scrooge, right. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Michael, do you remember he played Scrooge? - Sure. </seg>
<seg id="292"> - He was wonderful. With that night bonnet. He was very funny. </seg>
<seg id="293"> Let's talk about it, what about the victims after the stockholders' meeting... </seg>
<seg id="294"> We can't recall a drug because three guys can't walk a straight line! </seg>
<seg id="295"> For the time being, don't make a move. </seg>
<seg id="296"> All right, call you right back. </seg>
<seg id="297"> They're in panic mode. They have the media breathing down their necks. I want a release thant doesn't sound defensive at all. Just the opposite. Go for the jugular. Something like: "TW Pharma is a target." "Attempt at manipulation of the stock two weeks before the stockholders' meeting." " Where did this study come from anyway?" "How does this suddenly drop out of a clear blue sky", etcetera. </seg>
<seg id="298"> Not one word about the health issue. Just one question: Who is behind the study? Who? </seg>
<seg id="299"> Fine. </seg>
<seg id="300"> Nobody said you should listen to my conversation. </seg>
<seg id="301"> Nobody said you should have it under my nose. </seg>
<seg id="302"> I'm totally forced to have it here. Against my will, believe me. </seg>
<seg id="303"> They just peddle this shit, right? No one is responsible. </seg>
<seg id="304"> In any therapeutic advance there are benefits and there are risks. </seg>
<seg id="305"> Yeah, I know. Still you got some funny line of work. </seg>
<seg id="306"> - What does that mean? - Michael, it's none of our business. </seg>
<seg id="307"> - Funny line of work. - What about you, what do you do? </seg>
<seg id="308"> - I got a normal job. - What's a normal job? </seg>
<seg id="309"> - I told you, I sell pots and pans. - And door handles. </seg>
<seg id="310"> And flush mechanisms. And lot of other stuff. </seg>
<seg id="311"> "Flush mechanisms", I like that, That's interesting. </seg>
<seg id="312"> Flush toilets are interesting. Why not? </seg>
<seg id="313"> - How many different kinds do you have? </seg>
<seg id="314"> - There are two basic kinds. You got your push button and your handle operated. </seg>
<seg id="315"> - Yeah, right. - Depends where your water line is. </seg>
<seg id="316"> - I see. - It either comes from the side near the top, or it comes from the bottom. </seg>
<seg id="317"> One of my store managers is an expert. I could introduce you if you want. But you'll have to hump it out to Jamaica, Queens. </seg>
<seg id="318"> You seem like you know your business pretty well. </seg>
<seg id="319"> Are you planning to sanction Zachary in any way? </seg>
<seg id="320"> - I don't feel well. - What's the matter, are you all right? </seg>
<seg id="321"> - Oh you do look pale honey. - You're all white, yeah. </seg>
<seg id="322"> - Nauseous. - Some Reglan, you get some Reglan? </seg>
<seg id="323"> - No. I'll be fine. - Coke. What you need is a coke. </seg>
<seg id="324"> It's not cold. </seg>
<seg id="325"> - It's not cold. - Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="326"> Just little sips. The coke wasn't in the refrigerator. </seg>
<seg id="327"> Have him call me back. Tell him right away. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Is Coke good for that? It's more for diarrhea, isn't it? No, not only. Better? </seg>
<seg id="329"> I think so. Mrs. Longstreet... </seg>
<seg id="330"> If we decide to reprimand our child, we'll do it in our own way and on our own terms. </seg>
<seg id="331"> - Absolutely. - What absolutely? </seg>
<seg id="332"> He's their kid, they're free to do as they see fit. </seg>
<seg id="333"> - I don't agree. - You don't agree about what, Penny? </seg>
<seg id="334"> - They're not free. - Is that right? Go on. </seg>
<seg id="335"> But don't forget, nothing has been proven here, nothing is certain. </seg>
<seg id="336"> Don't fuck this up. </seg>
<seg id="337"> If we don't get this right, Walter will be out on his ear in two weeks, and so will we. </seg>
<seg id="338"> Enough, Alan! Enough with the cell phone already! The here and now, god dammit! </seg>
<seg id="339"> Call me back and read it to me. </seg>
<seg id="340"> What the hell is wrong with you? Screaming at me like that! - Dennis heard every word! </seg>
<seg id="341"> - Good! I'm sick of that fucking cell phone, every minute of every day! </seg>
<seg id="342"> Listen Nancy, you should be thanking me for agreeing to come here... </seg>
<seg id="343"> Really? - I'm going to throw up. - No you're not. </seg>
<seg id="344"> - I am. - You want to use the bathroom? </seg>
<seg id="345"> - Nobody's forcing you to stay... - She's right, nobody's forcing you to stay. </seg>
<seg id="346"> - I'm dizzy. - Stare at a point in space. </seg>
<seg id="347"> - Hey, you can see part of the EL from here. Cool! - Get away from me. Leave me alone. </seg>
<seg id="348"> - Should she go to the bathroom? - Go to the bathroom if you have to throw up. </seg>
<seg id="349"> - Give her some Reglan. - It can't be the cobbler, can it? </seg>
<seg id="350"> - No, I made it yesterday. - Don't touch me! </seg>
<seg id="351"> - Take it easy, Doodle. - Come on, don't get all bent out of shape over nothing. </seg>
<seg id="352"> My husband feels that anything to do with the house, the school, the backyard, - ...is my domain. - I do not. </seg>
<seg id="353"> You do so. And I can understand why. It's all so excruciatingly boring. It's excruciating. </seg>
<seg id="354"> If it's so excruciating, why do you have children in the first place? </seg>
<seg id="355"> Maybe Zachary picks up on that lack of interest. </seg>
<seg id="356"> - What lack of interest?! - You just said it yourself! </seg>
<seg id="357"> Go get a bucket, go get a bucket! </seg>
<seg id="358"> That stupid bitch. </seg>
<seg id="359"> You should have gone to the bathroom. Doodle, this is rediculous. - Your suit took a hit. </seg>
<seg id="360"> - What? - It can't be the cobbler. </seg>
<seg id="361"> That much I know. - It's not the cobbler, it's nerves. This is just nerves. </seg>
<seg id="362"> You want to clean up in the bathroom? </seg>
<seg id="363"> Oh my god, my Kokoschka. </seg>
<seg id="364"> - Give her some Reglan. - She couldn't keep anything down right now. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Where's the bathroom? </seg>
<seg id="366"> I'll show you. </seg>
<seg id="367"> This is nerves, just nerves. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Like I always say, you can't get over something when you're under it. </seg>
<seg id="370"> With me it's the back of my neck. </seg>
<seg id="371"> - What do we do about the Kokoschka? - We can clean it. Try Lysol. Only problem is drying it. </seg>
<seg id="372"> Or else with plain water and you put some cologne on there. </seg>
<seg id="373"> - Cologne? - I got some of that Kronos I never use. The paper will warp. </seg>
<seg id="374"> We'll blow-dry it, then put some books on top then flatten it out. Maybe iron it like dollar bills. </seg>
<seg id="375"> - Oh God! - I'll buy you another one. </seg>
<seg id="376"> There's no other one. It's been out of print for years. </seg>
<seg id="377"> - I'm so sorry. - We can save it. Pen, let me do this. </seg>
<seg id="378"> It's a reprint from the catalog of the 1963 show in London. </seg>
<seg id="379"> Go get the blow-dryer and the cologne. It's in the bathroom cabinet. </seg>
<seg id="380"> - Her husband is in the bathroom! - He's not in the can! </seg>
<seg id="381"> I got most of it off. Little bit on the Dolgans... </seg>
<seg id="382"> Excuse me! </seg>
<seg id="383"> - Are you feeling better? - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="384"> - Should I spray? - Where's the blow-dryer? </seg>
<seg id="385"> He's drying his pants. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Well, we'll wait. We'll put the Kouros on there last. </seg>
<seg id="387"> - Can I use the bathroom too? - Yes, of course. Of course. </seg>
<seg id="388"> I don't know what to say... </seg>
<seg id="389"> I am so sorry. </seg>
<seg id="390"> Bring the blow-dryer please. </seg>
<seg id="391"> God! </seg>
<seg id="392"> Unbelievable! Un-fucking-believable. </seg>
<seg id="393"> - Her cobbler is horrible. - You stuffed your face! </seg>
<seg id="394"> Look at my day. I have to get some food in me some time. </seg>
<seg id="395"> - Oh God. - What a freaking nightmare! </seg>
<seg id="396"> He better watch it, he's got me right on the edge. - She's horrible! </seg>
<seg id="397"> - Less. She's so fake. </seg>
<seg id="398"> - She doesn't bother me that much. - They're both horrible. </seg>
<seg id="399"> Why do you take their side all the time? - Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="400"> - I don't take their side. </seg>
<seg id="401"> What the hell are we doing here? </seg>
<seg id="402"> - I hope you're kidding. - Why do you argue with her? </seg>
<seg id="403"> We'd have been out of here a long time ago if you didn't bicker over every word. </seg>
<seg id="404"> You'd rather I was a sheep, like her husband? </seg>
<seg id="405"> - You think it was the cobbler? - Of course it was. </seg>
<seg id="406"> A little warm coke and... Bang! </seg>
<seg id="407"> Fuck! </seg>
<seg id="408"> You mitigate. You're trying to reconcile everything. - I'm not! </seg>
<seg id="409"> - You are. You had your gang and you were the leader, and they can do whatever they want with their son. </seg>
<seg id="410"> Their son is a threat to homeland security. When a kid is a menace to society it's everybody's business. </seg>
<seg id="411"> I can't believe she barfed all over my books! </seg>
<seg id="412"> When you know you're going to toss your cookies, you take precautions. </seg>
<seg id="413"> Oh, the Foujita! Disgusting... </seg>
<seg id="414"> I was right on the edge with that toilet flushing shit. </seg>
<seg id="415"> - You were incredible. - I held my own, right? </seg>
<seg id="416"> Incredible. "Jamaica, Queens", that was genius. </seg>
<seg id="417"> - Little piece of shit. What does he call her again? - Doodle. - Doodle... - Doodle! Yeah, I call her Doodle. </seg>
<seg id="418"> Oh, I'm sorry. We didn't mean anything. </seg>
<seg id="419"> It's just so easy to make fun of other people's pet names. </seg>
<seg id="420"> Michael, what do we call each other? I'm sure it's worse, right? </seg>
<seg id="421"> - Here, you want the blow-dryer. - Thanks. </seg>
<seg id="422"> We call each other darjeeling, like the tea. </seg>
<seg id="423"> A lot more embarrassing if you ask me. </seg>
<seg id="424"> - How's she feeling, is she feeling better? - Yeah, better. </seg>
<seg id="425"> I reacted badly. I'm ashamed. </seg>
<seg id="426"> I made a big deal about the catalog. I didn't really know why I did that. </seg>
<seg id="427"> You get so absurdly attached to these things, you don't even know why really. </seg>
<seg id="428"> - Pull it taut. - Hold on at the other side. I know I got it, just pull it taut. - The corners are wet. - I know, I get the corners. - It's gonna tear. - He's right, it gonna tear. - Here. - It's dry now. You put colognes right now and I finish those. </seg>
<seg id="429"> - What does Doodle come from? - Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="430"> Yankee Doodle? Cheese Doodle? </seg>
<seg id="431"> No, it's a song from Guys and Dolls that goes, "Doodle oodle oodle oo." </seg>
<seg id="432"> Oh yeah, I know that one. </seg>
<seg id="433"> Ours is from our honeynoon in India. </seg>
<seg id="434"> I called her darjeeling instead of darling. So stupid. </seg>
<seg id="435"> - Should I go check on her? - Go ahead, darjeeling. </seg>
<seg id="436"> Nancy! I was worried about you, all better? </seg>
<seg id="437"> Yeah, better, I think so. If you're not sure, stay away from the coffee table. </seg>
<seg id="438"> I left the towel in the bathtub. I didn't know where to put it. </seg>
<seg id="439"> Perfect. </seg>
<seg id="440"> You cleaned up? I'm so sorry. Everything is fine. All is well. </seg>
<seg id="441"> I'm sorry, I wasn't there for you. I was so focused on my Kokoschka. </seg>
<seg id="442"> That's all right. - No, I behaved poorly. - Please. </seg>
<seg id="443"> In the bathroom I was thinking. </seg>
<seg id="444"> Yes? </seg>
<seg id="445"> Maybe we glossed over the... </seg>
<seg id="446"> - Well I mean... - What? What is it? </seg>
<seg id="447"> - Name-calling is a kind of abuse. - Sure. </seg>
<seg id="448"> - Depends. - Right, depends. </seg>
<seg id="449"> Zachary has never been a violent child. He must have his reasons. </seg>
<seg id="450"> Like getting called a snitch. Excuse me. </seg>
<seg id="451"> Yeah, Walter. </seg>
<seg id="452"> As long as there are no victims on the panel. No victims. I don't want you sitting down with victims. </seg>
<seg id="453"> Deny, deny, deny. If we have to, we'll sue the Journal. </seg>
<seg id="454"> We'll e-mail you the draft of the press release, Walter, I'm sorry I got to go. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Call me a snitch, it gets a rise out of me. </seg>
<seg id="456"> - Unless it's ture. - What? </seg>
<seg id="457"> You know, the shoe fits. </seg>
<seg id="458"> - You think my son is a snitch? - Come on, joking around. </seg>
<seg id="459"> - So is yours anyway. - What do you mean so is ours? </seg>
<seg id="460"> - He snitched on Zachary. - We coaxed it out of him. </seg>
<seg id="461"> - We're completely off point here. - Maybe you coaxed, but he did snitch on him. </seg>
<seg id="462"> - Nancy... - Nancy what? - You think my son is a snitch? </seg>
<seg id="463"> - I don't think anything. Well if you don't think anything, don't say anything. Don't make insinuations. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Nancy, there's no reason to lose our cool here. </seg>
<seg id="465"> Michael and I have gone out of our way to be fair-minded and conciliating... </seg>
<seg id="466"> - Not so fair-minded. - Oh, really? </seg>
<seg id="467"> - Superficially fair-minded. - Doodle, I have to go. </seg>
<seg id="468"> So go, coward. </seg>
<seg id="469"> Nancy, right now I'm in danger of losing my most important client. </seg>
<seg id="470"> So this caring parent crap and the brickering that goes along with it... </seg>
<seg id="471"> - My son lost two teeth. Two incisors. - Yeah, right, we got that. </seg>
<seg id="472"> - One of them permanently. - He'll get new teeth. Better ones! </seg>
<seg id="473"> No one chewed his ear off! </seg>
<seg id="474"> It was a mistake not to consider the source of the problem. </seg>
<seg id="475"> There is no source. There's an 11-year-old kid who hits people, with a stick! </seg>
<seg id="476"> - Armed with a stick. - We took that word out. </seg>
<seg id="477"> - You took it out because we asked you to. - We took it out without argument. </seg>
<seg id="478"> A word which deliberately establishes intent and excludes any hint of a misunderstanding. </seg>
<seg id="479"> Which excludes childhood. </seg>
<seg id="480"> - I don't think I can stand this tone any more. - We're not quite on the same page, you and I. Right from the start. </seg>
<seg id="481"> Mr. Cowan, it is incredibly frustrating to be continued upbraided For something we ourselves admitted was a mistake. </seg>
<seg id="482"> Like the word "armed" wasn't right, we took it out. Strictly speaking, it certainly applies. </seg>
<seg id="483"> Zachary was verbally abused and over reacted. If I'm attacked, I defend myself. Especially when I'm all alone against a whole gang. </seg>
<seg id="484"> Well, you've certainly perked up since you tossed your cookies. Do you realize how crude that is? </seg>
<seg id="485"> We're all decent people. All four of us. How do we get all carried away, losing our tempers? </seg>
<seg id="486"> It's totally unnecessary. Michael, stop, stop metigating. </seg>
<seg id="487"> We're only superficially fair-minded, why should we be fair-minded at all? </seg>
<seg id="488"> - I'm not going to be led down that path. The path those two little shits led us down! </seg>
<seg id="489"> - I'm afraid Pen doesn't see things that way... - Penelope. - Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="490"> - So Ethan is a shit now. That really takes the cake. </seg>
<seg id="491"> - That's it. I really have to leave now. - Yeah so do I. </seg>
<seg id="492"> Go, go. I give up. </seg>
<seg id="493"> Hello? </seg>
<seg id="494"> Oh, hi Ma. No, we got some friends over but go ahead. </seg>
<seg id="495"> Yes, you just do whatever the doctors tell you to do. </seg>
<seg id="496"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="497"> The what? </seg>
<seg id="498"> Antril? You're taking Antril... Hold on a second. </seg>
<seg id="499"> Antril? That crap of yours, is that Antril? </seg>
<seg id="500"> - My mother's taking it. - Thousands of people take it. </seg>
<seg id="501"> Mum, you stop taking that one immediately. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Do what I tell you, I'll explain later. </seg>
<seg id="503"> Mum, you tell Dr. Perlstein that I won't let you take it. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Good. </seg>
<seg id="505"> Why red? So who can see you? </seg>
<seg id="506"> Mum, that's rediculous. Mum... </seg>
<seg id="507"> I have to call you back I told you I have company. </seg>
<seg id="508"> OK. I love you. Bye-bye. </seg>
<seg id="509"> She got red crutches so she won't hit by a truck. In case she wanders out on the street at night. </seg>
<seg id="510"> They're giving her Antril for her blood pressure. </seg>
<seg id="511"> If she's taking it and she looks normal, I'll take her deposition. </seg>
<seg id="512"> Didn't I have a scarf? I don't like that attitude of yours. </seg>
<seg id="513"> If my mother has the slightest symptom, my name will be at the top of a class-action suit. </seg>
<seg id="514"> - We'll have one anyway. - I should hope so! </seg>
<seg id="515"> Doing the right thing is futile. Honesty is just stupidity. All it does is weaken you. You let your guard down. </seg>
<seg id="516"> OK, let's go Nancy. That's enough sermons and lectures for one day. </seg>
<seg id="517"> Go ahead, go. But let me tell you this, now that I know you two, I'm not surprised </seg>
<seg id="518"> What's his name? Zachary, may have behaviour issues. </seg>
<seg id="519"> - When you killed that hamster... - Killed? </seg>
<seg id="520"> - Killed. - I killed the hamster? </seg>
<seg id="521"> Yes. You do everything you can to make us feel guilty. You stake out the moral highground as your own, but you yourself are a murderer. </seg>
<seg id="522"> I definitely did not kill the hamster. Worse. You left it out there, Trembling with fear in a hostile environment. That poor critter was probably eaten by a dog or a rat. </seg>
<seg id="523"> - She's right about that. - What do you mean she is right? I mean it's horrible, what must have happened to that animal! I thought the hamster would be happy to be free. I was sure he'd go running around in the gutter, happy as a clam! You just left him there! </seg>
<seg id="524"> I can't touch those things, OK? I can't touch anything of that family. - Christ, Penny you know that! - He's afraid of rodents. Yeah, I have a fear of rodents. </seg>
<seg id="525"> And I have a fear of reptiles. Anything down close to the ground, that's it, all right? What about you? How come you didn't go downstairs and get it? Because I didn't know! </seg>
<seg id="526"> Michael said this morning the hamster ran away. So I went right out, I went all the way around the block. I went to the basement! </seg>
<seg id="527"> Penelope, it is completely unfair that all of a sudden I'm in the hot seat about this hamster thing. That you just had to tell them about. That's a family issue. </seg>
<seg id="528"> That doesn't concern anybody but us and it's got nothing to do with this situation here! And I can't believe I'm getting called a murderer in my own house! </seg>
<seg id="529"> - What does your house have to do with the price of tea in China? - My house! I opened the door! The door is wide open in a spirit of reconciliation. To people who should be a little grateful! </seg>
<seg id="530"> Keep right on stroking your own ego, It's beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="531"> - So you have no remorse? - I have no remorse. That animal was disgusting and I'm glad it's gone. </seg>
<seg id="532"> - Michael, that's ridiculous. - What's rediculous? What, have you lost your mind too? </seg>
<seg id="533"> Their son beats the shit out of Ethan and you're in my face over a hamster? </seg>
<seg id="534"> What you did with that hamster was wrong and you can't deny that. - I don't give a shit about the hamster! </seg>
<seg id="535"> - You'll have to give a shit tonight when your daughter get home. </seg>
<seg id="536"> Bring her on! I'm not going to be told how to act by a 9-year-old snotnose brat! </seg>
<seg id="537"> Now I agree with him there, one hundred percent. </seg>
<seg id="538"> - That's pathetic. - Watch it, Penelope, watch it. </seg>
<seg id="539"> I've kept my shirt on up till now, but you're pushing me over a line. </seg>
<seg id="540"> - And Ethan? - What about Ethan? - Is he sad too? </seg>
<seg id="541"> - Ethan's got other things on his plate, if you ask me. - Ethan wasn't so attached to Nibbles. </seg>
<seg id="542"> - Nibbles? What kind of pussy name is that anyway? </seg>
<seg id="543"> If you feel no remorse, why should our son? </seg>
<seg id="544"> You know what? All this consultation and consideration shit. </seg>
<seg id="545"> I'm sick to death of it. We were nice to you. We bought tulips. My wife dressed me up as a liberal, but the fact is I got no patience for this touchy-feely bullshit. - And I'm a temperamental son of a bitch. - We all are. </seg>
<seg id="546"> No, I'm sorry. We are not all temperamental sons of bitches. </seg>
<seg id="547"> - Not you, of course. - No, not me! Thank God! Not you, darjee, not you. </seg>
<seg id="548"> You're so evolved. You never go off half-cocked. </seg>
<seg id="549"> - Why are you being so aggressive with me? - I'm not being aggressive. I'm being honest. </seg>
<seg id="550"> Yes, you are being aggressive! You put this little bash together and I let you recruit me... </seg>
<seg id="551"> - You let me recruit you? - Yes. That's so disgusting. </seg>
<seg id="552"> No, it's not. You're an advocate for civilized behavior, well that's fine with me. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Yes I'm advocate for civilized behavior, you bet I am! And it's a good thing somebody is! </seg>
<seg id="554"> You think it's better to be a son of a bitch? </seg>
<seg id="555"> Nobody said that, nobody critisized you that! - You did! </seg>
<seg id="556"> - We did not. What was I supposed to do? Was I supposed to sue you? </seg>
<seg id="557"> Never talk to you and tear you to pieces through the insurance company? </seg>
<seg id="558"> - Stop it, Penny. - Stop what?! - You're blowing this all out of proportion. - I don't care! </seg>
<seg id="559"> You do everything you can to avoid the pettiness and you wind up Humiliated and completely alone! </seg>
<seg id="560"> Yes, Walter. Well, let them prove it. Prove it! </seg>
<seg id="561"> From where I sit, the best thing for us to do... We're born alone and we die alone! Who wants a little Scotch? </seg>
<seg id="562"> Walter, I'm in a meeting right now. I'll call you when I get back to the office. That's the thing. I'm living with a totally negative person. </seg>
<seg id="563"> - Who's negative? - Me. </seg>
<seg id="564"> This was the worst possible idea! We should never have had this meeting. </seg>
<seg id="565"> - I told you so. - You told me so? Yeah! - You told me we should never have this meeting? </seg>
<seg id="566"> - I didn't think it was a very good idea. - It was a good idea. </seg>
<seg id="567"> - Oh come on. Who wants a little? You told me you think it wasn't a good idea? </seg>
<seg id="568"> - As I recall. - As you recall! - Maybe just a little slip. </seg>
<seg id="569"> - Don't you have to go? At this point in the game, I may as well have a little drink. </seg>
<seg id="570"> You tell me again we didn't both agree on this! </seg>
<seg id="571"> Calm down, Penelope, this is going nowhere. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Who said not to touch the cobbler this morning? Who said we should keep the rest for the Cowan's? Who said that?! </seg>
<seg id="573"> That was very nice of you. - What's that to do with anything? - What do you mean what's that to do with anything? </seg>
<seg id="574"> - Guests are guests. - You're lying, you're lying! </seg>
<seg id="575"> You know, my wife actually had to drag me here today. </seg>
<seg id="576"> When you grow up with a certain John Wayne idea of manhood, The impulse in this kind of situation is not to talk it through. </seg>
<seg id="577"> - I thought the role model was Ivanhoe. - Same basic concept. - Another aspect. - Another aspect! Just how much are you going to humiliate yourself? </seg>
<seg id="578"> I can see I dragged him here for nothing. </seg>
<seg id="579"> - What did you expect, Doodle? - That is a ridiculous nickname. </seg>
<seg id="580"> Some revelation about universal values? This scotch is unbelievable. </seg>
<seg id="581"> See that? 18 years old, single malt, from a tiny place in Scotland where they still grow their own barley. </seg>
<seg id="582"> What about the tulips? Who got them? </seg>
<seg id="583"> All I said was it's too bad we didn't get any tulips. </seg>
<seg id="584"> I never said anything about going all the way up to Henry street at dawn. </seg>
<seg id="585"> Don't get all bent out of shape over this, Penelope, It's not worth it. </seg>
<seg id="586"> He got the tulips! Him and only him! </seg>
<seg id="587"> Don't we get a drink? </seg>
<seg id="588"> Penelope and I would like a drink too. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Pretty funny when you think about it. </seg>
<seg id="590"> A devotee of Ivanhoe and John Wayne but he's scared to pick up an itty-bitty mouse. </seg>
<seg id="591"> - Stop the hamster. Stop. - She's right, it's laughable. </seg>
<seg id="592"> - And her? - I don't think that will be necessary. </seg>
<seg id="593"> - Pour me a drink, Michael. - No. - Michael! - No. </seg>
<seg id="594"> What is wrong with you, Michael? Fine, fine. Drink, What does it matter? </seg>
<seg id="595"> - Is drinking bad for you or something? - No, no, it's great for me. </seg>
<seg id="596"> Now I don't know... </seg>
<seg id="597"> - Mr. Cowan... - Alan. Alan... </seg>
<seg id="598"> See, you and I didn't exactly hit it off I live with a man who has decided once and for all that life is synonymous with mediocrity. </seg>
<seg id="599"> It's very hard to live with a man who's walled himself up in that idea, who doesn't want to change anything, who never gets excited about anything... </seg>
<seg id="600"> What are you telling this for? He could care less. </seg>
<seg id="601"> You have to believe, you have to believe some possible correction. </seg>
<seg id="602"> He's the last guy on earth you should be telling this to. </seg>
<seg id="603"> I'll talk to anyone I damn well please! </seg>
<seg id="604"> Who the fuck is that now? </seg>
<seg id="605"> Mother. Hi, Ma. </seg>
<seg id="606"> He's fine. He got his teeth knocked out but he's fine. </seg>
<seg id="607"> He's in pain, it hurts, it'll pass. </seg>
<seg id="608"> Ma, I told you I have company. I'll call you back, remember? Yeah, bye. </seg>
<seg id="609"> - He's still in pain? - No. </seg>
<seg id="610"> - Then why do you worry your mother? - He has to worry, he can't help himself. </seg>
<seg id="611"> Ok, Penelope, that's enough. What is this drama queen bullshit? </seg>
<seg id="612"> Penelope, nobody cares about anything outside himself. </seg>
<seg id="613"> Sure, we'd all like to believe in some kind of possible correction, One we could author ourselves, completely free of selfish consideration. Like you're writing this book about Darfur... Which is great! </seg>
<seg id="614"> I understand how you might say, OK, I'll pick a massacre, History is full of them, and I'm going to write a book. </seg>
<seg id="615"> Everybody has to save himself somehow. I'm not writing this book to save myself. </seg>
<seg id="616"> You haven't read it, you don't even know what's in it! Whatever. </seg>
<seg id="617"> The smell of Kronos is killing me. </seg>
<seg id="618"> - It fucking reeks! - You didn't exactly skimp. - I'm so sorry. - It's my fault. I sprayed like a madwoman. Why can't things be easier? </seg>
<seg id="619"> Why does everything have to be so exhausting? </seg>
<seg id="620"> You think too much. Women think too much. </seg>
<seg id="621"> There's an original response? I don't know what that means, to think too much. </seg>
<seg id="622"> And I don't understand how you can go on living without some moral sense of the world. </seg>
<seg id="623"> Look at me, I'm living! Michael, shut up. </seg>
<seg id="624"> Miserable complicity! Just disgusting. </seg>
<seg id="625"> - What happened to your sense of humor? - I don't have a sense of humor, and I don't want one. </seg>
<seg id="626"> If you ask me, the couple is the most terrible ordeal God ever inflicted on us. </seg>
<seg id="627"> Ah, marvelous. - The couple and the family. </seg>
<seg id="628"> - No one is forcing you to air this out in front of us, Michael. And I might add, it's a little indecent. </seg>
<seg id="629"> - That doesn't bother him. - You agree with me, don't you? </seg>
<seg id="630"> Look, this is all, beside the point. </seg>
<seg id="631"> - Alan, say something. - He has a right to his ideas. </seg>
<seg id="632"> - That doesn't mean he has to advertise them. - Yeah, maybe. </seg>
<seg id="633"> We don't care about their marriage. </seg>
<seg id="634"> We're here about a problem with the kids. We don't care about their marriage. </seg>
<seg id="635"> - Yes, except... - Except what? </seg>
<seg id="636"> - It's related. - Of course it's related. </seg>
<seg id="637"> Ethan's getting two of his teeth broken is related to our marriage? </seg>
<seg id="638"> - Of course it is. - Sorry I don't follow you. </seg>
<seg id="639"> Take a step back and look at the situation we're in. </seg>
<seg id="640"> Chrldren suck the life out of you and leave us old and empty. It's the law of nature. You see these young couples, laughing all the way to the alter. You think they don't know. Poor fuckers have no idea. They're happy. Nobody tells y ou this stuff in the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="641"> I get this army buddy of mine is going to have a kid with his new girlfriend. </seg>
<seg id="642"> I say to him, "A kid at our age? what are you stupid?" </seg>
<seg id="643"> "You got ten, fifteen good years left before you get cancer or have a stroke," "and you're gonna saddle yourself with a fucking kid?" </seg>
<seg id="644"> - That's not really what you think. - Yes it is. - Of course it's what I think, even worse. </seg>
<seg id="645"> - Yeah, you're debasing yourself, Michael. </seg>
<seg id="646"> Is that right? Stop crying, Penelope. Makes it worse. </seg>
<seg id="647"> Of course, of course. </seg>
<seg id="648"> - Excellent, isn't it? - So excellent. - Could I interest you in a cigar? </seg>
<seg id="649"> - No cigars in the house! - Too bad. </seg>
<seg id="650"> - Were you going to smoke a cigar now, Alan? </seg>
<seg id="651"> I do what I want, Nancy. If I want to smoke a cigar, I smoke a cigar. </seg>
<seg id="652"> I won't smoke it because I don't want to upset Penelope, Who's already on edge, to put it mildly. </seg>
<seg id="653"> Oh, quit snuffling like that, she's right. </seg>
<seg id="654"> When women cry, men are pushing to their breaking point. </seg>
<seg id="655"> Although unfortunately, I must say that Michael's point of view is completely justified. </seg>
<seg id="656"> Yeah. Yeah, sure, go ahead. </seg>
<seg id="657"> Put "New York" and a specific time of day. It's unbearable! </seg>
<seg id="658"> The time you send it. It has to be hot off the press. </seg>
<seg id="659"> No, not "questions". "Deplores". Questions is wishy-washy. </seg>
<seg id="660"> I live with this night and day. - One second. </seg>
<seg id="661"> - Our lives are chopped up by the cell phone. - Nancy, this is very important. </seg>
<seg id="662"> - It's always very important. What's happening somewhere else is always more important. </seg>
<seg id="663"> Not "strategy". "Scheme". A scheme surfacing two weeks from the company's posting. In the street. At the dinner table. Everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="664"> "A study" in quotes. Put the word "study" in quotes. </seg>
<seg id="665"> I don't even protest anymore. Unconditional surrender. </seg>
<seg id="666"> - I feel like I'm going to vomit again. - Where's that bucket? How am I supposed to know? </seg>
<seg id="667"> Then just quote me. </seg>
<seg id="668"> - Can you stand over the bucket please? - Pen! It's all right. We're set up to handle this now. </seg>
<seg id="669"> ...according to TW Pharma attorney Alan Cowan. AP, Reuters, major newspapers, trade journals, the whole shebang. </seg>
<seg id="670"> - What's wrong? - She's gonna throw up again. </seg>
<seg id="671"> - You're so caring, it's touching. - I'm worried. </seg>
<seg id="672"> I didn't get that, my mistake. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Oh come on Nancy, will you? You and I don't have to do this. </seg>
<seg id="674"> Their marriage is going downhill, we don't have to try to compete with them. </seg>
<seg id="675"> What gives you the right to say our marriage is going downhill? </seg>
<seg id="676"> Yeah, Walter. </seg>
<seg id="677"> Yeah, I just had it read back. They're sending it over to you. Manipulation. Manipulation of the stock price. Walter, I'll call you back in a minute. - I didn't say it. Steven did. </seg>
<seg id="678"> - Michael. - I won't let you judge our family. - Then don't judge our son either. </seg>
<seg id="679"> That's different! Your son brutalized our son! </seg>
<seg id="680"> They're young, they're kids, kids roughhouse in the playground. Always have always will, it's a rule of nature. - No it isn't! - Sure it is. </seg>
<seg id="681"> It takes a little education to substitute the rule of law for violence. </seg>
<seg id="682"> The origin of law, of course you know, is brute force. </seg>
<seg id="683"> Maybe for cavemen, not in this world. - Tell me about this world! </seg>
<seg id="684"> - Boring! This conversation is boring. </seg>
<seg id="685"> Penelope, I believe in the god of carnage. The god whose rule has been unchallenged since time immemorial. </seg>
<seg id="686"> You're interested in Africa, right? </seg>
<seg id="687"> - What's the matter? - Don't worry about me. </seg>
<seg id="688"> - Nancy! - I'm just fine. </seg>
<seg id="689"> See, I just got back from the Congo. They got kids there, trained to kill at the age of eight. In the course of their childhood, they might kill hundreds of people. They'll kill with a machete, a shotgun, a Kalash, a thumper. </seg>
<seg id="690"> So obviously when my kid busts some other kid's tooth, even two teeth, with a bamboo switch by the sandbox, I'm not quite as shocked and indignant as you are. </seg>
<seg id="691"> - Well you should be. - Thumper. - Yes, that's why they call a grenade launcher. </seg>
<seg id="692"> - That's what I call it. - You all right? - Just fine. </seg>
<seg id="693"> - What's wrong with her? - It's bile, nothing. </seg>
<seg id="694"> Don't you tell me about Africa! I know all about suffering in Africa. </seg>
<seg id="695"> I don't doubt it. That's all I've been thinking about for months! </seg>
<seg id="696"> Don't get her started on this, please! </seg>
<seg id="697"> - You know I'm actually starting to like you. - Shut up! </seg>
<seg id="698"> - Talk about commitment to world peace and stability. - Shut the fuck up, Michael! </seg>
<seg id="699"> - You sure about that? - Very sure. Do me some good. </seg>
<seg id="700"> We live in New York. We don't live in Kinshasa! We live in New York City! </seg>
<seg id="701"> With the customs of western society. What happens in a Brooklyn playground is about western values! To which, like it or not, I happen to subscribe. </seg>
<seg id="702"> Beating your husband must be one of those customs then... </seg>
<seg id="703"> - I'm warning you, Michael! - She was all over you like a bad rash! </seg>
<seg id="704"> - If I were you it would melt my heart. </seg>
<seg id="705"> - He's making fun of you, do you believe it? I don't care about this... </seg>
<seg id="706"> No, really. Morally, we're supposed to overcome our impulses but there are times you don't want to overcome them. </seg>
<seg id="707"> I mean, who wants to say a "Hail Mary" when having sex? </seg>
<seg id="708"> - Can you buy this scotch around here? - No, this very likely no. </seg>
<seg id="709"> Thumper! </seg>
<seg id="710"> - Thumper, really. - Yeah. Thumper. So it is called. </seg>
<seg id="711"> - Why don't you just say grenade launcher? - Because it's a term. </seg>
<seg id="712"> Just like they say "kalash" and not Kalashnikov or AK-47. </seg>
<seg id="713"> - Who is they? - That's enough, Nancy, that's enough. </seg>
<seg id="714"> Hotshot firebrands like my husband, you got to understand, It's hard for them to get excited about what happens down the block. </seg>
<seg id="715"> Exactly. I don't see why. I don't see why. </seg>
<seg id="716"> We're all citizens of the world. I don't see why we shouldn't have some sense of community. </seg>
<seg id="717"> Penelope, enough for the highfalutin clap trap! </seg>
<seg id="718"> I'm gonna kill him. Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="719"> She's right! It's unbearable after a while. </seg>
<seg id="720"> "Brazen". a brazen attempt to... There you go. </seg>
<seg id="721"> He sighed off the rest? Sure. </seg>
<seg id="722"> What were we talking about? Thumpers? </seg>
<seg id="723"> We were saying that, dispite my husband thinks, Whether it happens here or other parts of the world, we must be collectively concerned. "Collectively concerned". </seg>
<seg id="724"> Nancy, it's absurd to drink in your condition. </seg>
<seg id="725"> What condition? I'm perfect. </seg>
<seg id="726"> That's interesting... Yeah? </seg>
<seg id="727"> No, no interviews before we get this release out. </seg>
<seg id="728"> Mr. Cowan, would you please put an end to this nerve-racking conversation? </seg>
<seg id="729"> No way. The stockholders won't give a shit. The stockholders... </seg>
<seg id="730"> Nancy what are you... Are you out of your fucking mind? </seg>
<seg id="731"> - There. - Shit! - Oh my god. - Way to go! </seg>
<seg id="732"> - The blow-dryer! - What is wrong with you? </seg>
<seg id="733"> I can't believe this! I got everything in there. It's brand new, I spent hours setting it up! </seg>
<seg id="734"> I can't believe you did that. That was an irresponsible thing to do. </seg>
<seg id="735"> My whole life was in there! </seg>
<seg id="736"> Take out the battery and SIM card. How to do that? </seg>
<seg id="737"> I just got it, I don't know! They thikn it's funny, they think it's funny! Penelope, it's not funny! </seg>
<seg id="738"> My husband has spent the entire afternoot drying thing! - Forget it. It's over. - You gotta wait. </seg>
<seg id="739"> You want to use the phone? I must say... </seg>
<seg id="740"> What...What must you say, Michael? </seg>
<seg id="741"> No, I don't even know what to say. </seg>
<seg id="742"> I'd say it feels better like this, wouldn't you? </seg>
<seg id="743"> Men get so attached to their toys. It diminishes them. They lose their credibility. I liked this guy once and then I saw him carrying this rectangular bag. ut with a shoulder strap. A man's bag, but with a shoulder strap! It was over! </seg>
<seg id="744"> A bag with a shoulder strap, that's the worst. But the cell phone always at his fingertips is the worst, too. </seg>
<seg id="745"> A man should have both hands free. </seg>
<seg id="746"> I've got a John Wayne idea of manhood, too. </seg>
<seg id="747"> What was it he had? A Colt '45. Something that empties a room... </seg>
<seg id="748"> Any man that doesn't give off those loner vibes just doesn't come off as having any substance... </seg>
<seg id="749"> So Michael, I guess you are happy now. </seg>
<seg id="750"> Our touchy-feely-whatever you said is coming apart at the seams. But you know what? This almost feels good. In my opinion. </seg>
<seg id="751"> Yeah, well in my opinion, some people can hold their liquor better than others. </seg>
<seg id="752"> - I'm as normal as I can be. - Yeah, right. </seg>
<seg id="753"> I'm beginning to see things with a pleasant serenity. </seg>
<seg id="754"> That's good! "A pleasant serenity"! </seg>
<seg id="755"> I can't understand why you're wasting yourself, right out in the open, darjeeling. </seg>
<seg id="756"> - Shut the hell up. - Alan, relax. </seg>
<seg id="757"> - No cigars in the house! - Hoyo de Monterrey. Partagas D number4, you got your Hoyo Coronation. </seg>
<seg id="758"> - Where did you get these? - You don't want to know. - Seriously. - The Spanish connection. My cookware guy. His best friend is going with a flight attendant. Brings in like two boxes a week. </seg>
<seg id="759"> You can't smoke in a house with an asthmatic child! And why are you telling him your whole life story? </seg>
<seg id="760"> - Who has asthma? - Our son. - We had a goddamn hamster, didn't we? </seg>
<seg id="761"> - It's true that pets aren't good when you're asthmatic. </seg>
<seg id="762"> - Not good at all! - Even goldfish aren't necessarily recommended. </seg>
<seg id="763"> Do I have to listen to this crap? </seg>
<seg id="764"> I guess I'm the only one who doesn't see things with pleasant serendity. </seg>
<seg id="765"> The truth is, I've never been so unhappy. Unhappiest day of my life. </seg>
<seg id="766"> You're an unhappy drunk. </seg>
<seg id="767"> Michael, every word out of your mouth just slays me. </seg>
<seg id="768"> I don't get drunk. I had a sip of your shitty 18-year old single malt... that you trot out like it's the 18 wonder of the world. </seg>
<seg id="769"> I don't get drunk, and believe me I wish I could. It would be such a relief to drown every little sorrow in a good stiff drink. </seg>
<seg id="770"> My husband is unhappy, too. </seg>
<seg id="771"> Look at him. All hunched over. Like he was left on the side of the road. </seg>
<seg id="772"> I think this is the unhappiest day of his life, too. </seg>
<seg id="773"> - It is! - I'm sorry, Doodle. </seg>
<seg id="774"> Hello? </seg>
<seg id="775"> Hello? </seg>
<seg id="776"> Mum! I told you I have company, remember? </seg>
<seg id="777"> Because it's medication thant can kill you! It's poison! </seg>
<seg id="778"> Mum, someone here who can explain. </seg>
<seg id="779"> - Here! Tell her! - Tell her what? </seg>
<seg id="780"> Tell her what you know about that poison shit of yours. </seg>
<seg id="781"> What can he tell her? He doesn't know anything. </seg>
<seg id="782"> Hello, ma'am, how are you? </seg>
<seg id="783"> No... Are you in pain? </seg>
<seg id="784"> Yeah...the operation will fix that. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The other leg too, huh? </seg>
<seg id="786"> No, I'm not an orthopedist. She keeps calling me doctor. </seg>
<seg id="787"> Doctor, what a laugh! Hang up! </seg>
<seg id="788"> Yeah! Do you have any balance issues? </seg>
<seg id="789"> No, of course not, not at all. It can't kill you. Don't listen to what people say. </seg>
<seg id="790"> It's probably a good idea not to take it for a while. Just until this operation is behind you. </seg>
<seg id="791"> Yes, sounds like you're in excellent shape. You got that Ma? You stop taking that medication! </seg>
<seg id="792"> Do as a told, all right? I love you. </seg>
<seg id="793"> I can't take her anymore. </seg>
<seg id="794"> - The shit I put up with. - All right, should we wrap this up? </seg>
<seg id="795"> Should I come back tonight with Zachary? Let's decide. </seg>
<seg id="796"> This is getting to be like, who cares? That is what we're here for, after all. </seg>
<seg id="797"> Now I'm going to be sick. Where's that bucket? </seg>
<seg id="798"> That's enough! </seg>
<seg id="799"> I'd say both sides share the blame. There you are, both sides share the blame. </seg>
<seg id="800"> - Are you serious? - Excuse me? </seg>
<seg id="801"> - That's what you really think? - It's what I think, yes. </seg>
<seg id="802"> My son Ethan, who took codeine last night at three in the morning, he shares the blame? </seg>
<seg id="803"> He's not necessarily innocent. </seg>
<seg id="804"> Get out my house. Get the fuck out of my house! </seg>
<seg id="805"> My bag! What is going on here? They're totally lost it. </seg>
<seg id="806"> - Alan, do something! - "Alan, do something" </seg>
<seg id="807"> Shut your mouth! She broke my make-up mirror and my perfume! </seg>
<seg id="808"> Stand up for me. Why don't you stand up for me? </seg>
<seg id="809"> - Let's go, Nancy. - It's not like I'm strangling her! </seg>
<seg id="810"> - What did I do to you? </seg>
<seg id="811"> - The blame is not shared! The victim and the criminal are not the same! </seg>
<seg id="812"> - The criminal?! - Oh give it a fucking rest, Penelope! Enough of these idealistic theories shit! </seg>
<seg id="813"> - Which I believe in. - You believe, you believe! </seg>
<seg id="814"> This crush you got on these Sudan sambos is spilling over into everything now! </seg>
<seg id="815"> I am horrified. How can you be so openly despicable? </seg>
<seg id="816"> Because I feel like it. I feel like being openly despicable. </seg>
<seg id="817"> One day you'll understand the sheer horror of what's happening in that part of the world, And you'll be ashamed of you inability to take action, of your contemptibly nihilistic attitude. </seg>
<seg id="818"> Yes, darjeeling, you're so wonderful! - You're the best and the brightest! - Yes I am! Yes I am! </seg>
<seg id="819"> Let's get out of here Alan. These people are monsters. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - Stop it, Nancy. - No, no. I want to drink some more. I want to get drunk off my ass. </seg>
<seg id="821"> This bitch throws my bag against a wall and nobody lifts a finger. </seg>
<seg id="822"> - I want to be blink drunk! - You're drunk enough. </seg>
<seg id="823"> How can you let her call our son a criminal? </seg>
<seg id="824"> We came over here to work things out... They insult us, browbeat us, they lecture us about being good citizens of the planet. </seg>
<seg id="825"> I'm glad our son kicked the shit out of your son, And I wipe my ass with your human rights! </seg>

<seg id="831"> You had known her 15 minutes and you already knew she was a fake? </seg>
<seg id="832"> - I pick up on these things in people very quickly. - She does. - I just have a nose for it. </seg>
<seg id="833"> - Fake, what does that mean? I don't want to listen to this. Why do you put me through this, Alan? </seg>
<seg id="834"> Relax, Nancy... </seg>
<seg id="835"> She's a complete phony. She doesn't care any more than you do. </seg>
<seg id="836"> It's true. - He said it's true. - They don't give a shit! </seg>

<seg id="838"> - She doesn't give a shit either. - Like you do? </seg>
<seg id="839"> Let him talk, honey. Explain to me, Michael, exactly how you care. What does that mean anyway? You're more credible when you're being openly despicable. </seg>
<seg id="840"> Truth is, nobody here cares. Except maybe Penelope. One must acknowledge her integrity. </seg>
<seg id="841"> I don't need your acknowledgment! I don't need your acknowledgment! </seg>
<seg id="842"> But I do care. I really do care. </seg>

<seg id="847"> You're the same breed. You're the same kind of involved, problem-solver woman. </seg>

<seg id="849"> The gatekeepers of the world, the ones who want to show off how perceptive they are, Huge turnoff. </seg>
<seg id="850"> Even poor Michael, your own husband is turned off... Don't you speak for me. </seg>
<seg id="851"> We don't give a shit about what women you like! </seg>
<seg id="852"> Where do you get off spouting these opinions? </seg>
<seg id="853"> You're one man whose opinions we don't give a shit about! </seg>
<seg id="854"> She is screaming. A quartermaster on a slave ship. </seg>
<seg id="855"> What about her? She doesn't scream? She didn't just scream that your little asshole was right to beat up ours? </seg>
<seg id="856"> He was right! At least our kid isn't a little wimpy-ass faggot! Yours is a fucking snitch! </seg>
<seg id="857"> Let's go Alan, why are we still in this house? </seg>
