00:02:22,922 --> 00:02:25,164
[Penelope] January 11th, at 2:30 PM.

5
00:02:25,995 --> 00:02:28,994
You'll do your statement separately, this is ours.

6
00:02:28,995 --> 00:02:32,479
...following a verbal dispute in Brooklyn Bridge Park...

7
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,937
Zachary Cowan, age 11, and armed with a stick

8
00:02:36,938 --> 00:02:41,039
struck our son, Ethan Longstreet, in the face.

9
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:45,801
In addition ot the swelling and bruising 
of Ethan's upper lip

10
00:02:45,802 --> 00:02:50,132
this act also resulted in two broken incisors

11
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:53,788
including nerve damage to the right incisor

12
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:55,088
"Armed"?

13
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:58,269
Armed. You don't like armed?

14
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:02,331
Michael, what could we say?
Carrying? Holding? Carring a stick?

15
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:04,587
- "Carrying", yeah.
- "Carrying a stick".

16
00:03:04,588 --> 00:03:06,609
"Carrying"...

17
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:11,821
It's ironic, we always thought the 
Brooklyn Bridge Park was so safe

18
00:03:11,822 --> 00:03:16,238
- Compared to Hillside.
- Ture. We always said, Brooklyn Bridge Park,
fine. Hillside, no way.

19
00:03:17,742 --> 00:03:19,570
Just goes to show you.

20
00:03:20,198 --> 00:03:22,487
Hey, thank you so much for coming!

21
00:03:22,488 --> 00:03:27,803
It's so much better than getting caught
up in that adversarial mindset.

22
00:03:27,804 --> 00:03:32,768
- Well we thank you, really.
- There's no reason we have to thank each other.

23
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:36,113
Luckily, some of us still have a sense of community, right?

24
00:03:36,114 --> 00:03:39,006
Though the kids haven't got that notion straight yet.

25
00:03:39,007 --> 00:03:43,364
- I mean our kid.
- Right, our kid.

26
00:03:49,392 --> 00:03:51,191
Those tulips are gorgeous.

27
00:03:51,192 --> 00:03:54,786
Oh it's the little florist on Henry,
you know, all the way up?

28
00:03:54,787 --> 00:03:56,009
Oh right!

29
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,592
They fly the bulbs in straight from Holland,
20 dollars for a whole bunch.

30
00:03:59,593 --> 00:04:01,595
- That a fact?
- Yeah.

31
00:04:01,596 --> 00:04:04,539
- Do you know the one? All the way up.
- Right, right.

32
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:09,316
What about the tooth with the damaged nerve?

33
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:13,691
Oh. Well they don't know. 
There's still some question about the prognosis.

34
00:04:15,016 --> 00:04:18,874
-  Apparently, the nerve is not completely exposed.
- Only part of it is exposed.

35
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:22,242
Right. There's a part that's exposed
and a part that's still protected.

36
00:04:22,243 --> 00:04:27,024
- So now, they're not going to devitalize it.
- They want to give the tooth a chance.

37
00:04:27,057 --> 00:04:29,774
We would so like to avoid root canal.

38
00:04:29,775 --> 00:04:32,865
- Of course.
- So there's an observation period while they give the nerve a chance to heal.

39
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,812
- Meantime, he's going to need caps.
- You can't have implants until you're eighteen anyway.

40
00:04:35,813 --> 00:04:37,134
You can't.

41
00:04:37,135 --> 00:04:39,602
The permanent implants can only be 
done once you stop growing.

42
00:04:39,637 --> 00:04:44,401
Naturally. I hope... I hope it all turns out all right.

43
00:04:44,434 --> 00:04:45,802
We can only hope.

44
00:04:45,803 --> 00:04:51,426
You know, he didn't want to tell on Zachary.

45
00:04:51,427 --> 00:04:53,111
No, he didn't want to tell.

46
00:04:53,146 --> 00:04:58,981
I mean it was incredible to see this child
with no face left, no teeth...

47
00:04:58,982 --> 00:05:02,411
- And he just wouldn't talk.
- I can just imagine.

48
00:05:02,412 --> 00:05:06,206
He didn't want to tell on the kid.
Like his friends would say he was a snitch.

49
00:05:06,207 --> 00:05:08,784
I mean let's be honest, Penelope,
it wasn't only a sense of honor.

50
00:05:08,785 --> 00:05:11,864
You could say that. But a sense of honor
requires a social context...

51
00:05:11,865 --> 00:05:14,239
So how did you finally get Zachary's name?

52
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,147
Well because we explained to Ethan that
protecting this child was not going to help him.

53
00:05:20,148 --> 00:05:23,364
We told him, if this kid thinks he can go on hitting
people and getting away with it, why should he stop?

54
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:26,868
We told him that if we were that child's parents,
we would absolutely want to know about this.

55
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:29,698
- Of course.
- Yeah. [phone vibrates] Excuse me one second.

56
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:33,263
Yes Walter, thanks for getting back to me.

57
00:05:33,264 --> 00:05:36,705
So it's in this morning's Journal. I'll read it to you.

58
00:05:36,706 --> 00:05:40,031
"According to a study published by British journal Lancet..."

59
00:05:40,032 --> 00:05:42,172
"two Australian researchers have identified..."

60
00:05:42,173 --> 00:05:47,634
"...neurological side effects of TW Pharma's 
anti-hypertension medication Antril..."

61
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:50,162
"including impaired hearing and ataxia."

62
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,908
Who the hell does your press monitoring over there?

63
00:05:54,964 --> 00:05:57,151
Yeah, you're in deep shit.

64
00:05:58,345 --> 00:06:00,555
No, my problem is the A.S.M.

65
00:06:00,556 --> 00:06:03,053
You have an Annual Stockholders Meeting in two weeks.

66
00:06:03,054 --> 00:06:05,709
Did you schedule a contingency for litigation?

67
00:06:07,643 --> 00:06:11,880
Walter, Walter. Talk to PR and find out 

68
00:06:11,881 --> 00:06:14,314
If it was picked up somewhere else and call me back.

69
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,597
Sorry.

70
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:18,994
- So you're like a...
- An attorney.

71
00:06:18,995 --> 00:06:22,227
- And yourself?
- Houseware supply.

72
00:06:22,228 --> 00:06:23,442
Penelope is a writer.

73
00:06:23,443 --> 00:06:26,355
She works part time in a bookstore,
mostly art books and history books.

74
00:06:26,356 --> 00:06:27,935
A writer!

75
00:06:27,936 --> 00:06:31,091
I co-wrote a volume about Sabean civilization.

76
00:06:31,092 --> 00:06:34,906
Working from artifacts recovered when they
resumed digs after the Ethiopia-Eritrea conflict.

77
00:06:34,907 --> 00:06:38,742
And now I have a book coming out in January
about the Darfur tragedy.

78
00:06:38,743 --> 00:06:40,808
So you specialize in Africa.

79
00:06:40,809 --> 00:06:43,352
I'm interested in that part of the world, yes.

80
00:06:43,353 --> 00:06:46,737
- Do you have any other children?
- There's Courtney, she is nine.

81
00:06:46,738 --> 00:06:51,499
She's very angry at her father right now.
He got rid of the hamster last night.

82
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,177
- You got rid of the hamster?
- Yeah.

83
00:06:56,022 --> 00:06:59,620
Made such a racket at night. 
Those things sleep during the day.

84
00:06:59,621 --> 00:07:04,169
Ethan was going crazy, he couldn't stand
the racket that hamster made.

85
00:07:05,462 --> 00:07:09,220
I don't mind telling you, I've been wanting to 
get rid of the thing for the longest time.

86
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:12,645
So I thought, that's it. I took it out and
left it on the street.

87
00:07:12,646 --> 00:07:15,660
- You left it on the street?
- I figured it was a gutter-sewer kind of animal.

88
00:07:15,661 --> 00:07:18,985
But it was scared out of its wits, 
out there, on that sidewalk.

89
00:07:18,986 --> 00:07:21,445
Truth is, they're not pets and they're not wild.

90
00:07:21,446 --> 00:07:24,932
Drop them in the middle of the forrest they're still
unhappy. I mean where are you supposed to put them?

91
00:07:24,966 --> 00:07:28,654
- You just left him outside?
- Yeah, he did.

92
00:07:28,655 --> 00:07:31,229
And then he tried to convince Courtney
that the hamster ran away.

93
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,781
Which, of course, she was not buying.

94
00:07:33,782 --> 00:07:36,749
- And this morning the hamster was gone?
- Gone.

95
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:42,401
- And what about you? What do you do for a living?
- I'm an investment broker.

96
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:47,640
Let me... I'll just gonna ask this directly.

97
00:07:48,447 --> 00:07:51,495
Could Zachary apologize to Ethan?

98
00:07:51,496 --> 00:07:54,008
Sure. It would be good if they talked.

99
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:58,211
He's got to apologize, Alan.
He has to actually say he's sorry.

100
00:07:58,212 --> 00:08:00,148
- Yeah, probably.
- Well, is he sorry?

101
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:03,976
He didn't realize how serious it was.
He's eleven years old.

102
00:08:03,977 --> 00:08:07,501
- Eleven is not a baby.
- It's not an adult either.

103
00:08:07,502 --> 00:08:10,428
We didn't ask you, you want some coffee or tea?

104
00:08:10,429 --> 00:08:13,027
Is there any cobbler left, Penny?
She makes a mean cobbler!

105
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:15,900
- You got espresso?
- We do!

106
00:08:15,901 --> 00:08:18,754
- I wouldn't mind a cup.
- A glass of water.

107
00:08:18,755 --> 00:08:22,390
Yeah. Espresso for me too, babe. And bring
the cobbler. Come on, come on.

108
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,649
Please, please have a seat.

109
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,636
Here, here

110
00:08:33,489 --> 00:08:35,079
Thank you.

111
00:08:42,225 --> 00:08:44,418
You got to taste this cobbler.

112
00:08:45,487 --> 00:08:47,147
Where's the cobbler?

113
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:58,733
She put the cobbler in the fridge again.
I don't know what language I should speak to her in.

114
00:08:59,432 --> 00:09:03,201
- Nice couple.
- Very.

115
00:09:03,545 --> 00:09:05,253
They're nice, right?

116
00:09:06,115 --> 00:09:09,664
- You tell everybody I'm a writer?
- You are a writer. You wrote a book.

117
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,290
Good cobbler is not easy to make.

118
00:09:18,272 --> 00:09:21,516
- What do you sell?
- Decorative hardware...

119
00:09:21,517 --> 00:09:24,964
Door locks, handles, copper fittings...

120
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:28,540
And kitchen equipment, pots and pans...

121
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,845
Is that a good living?

122
00:09:30,846 --> 00:09:35,605
You know, it's not like we had any banner
years or anything. It was tough starting out.

123
00:09:35,638 --> 00:09:40,053
But long as I'm out there every morning,
with my catalog and my sample case, it's a living.

124
00:09:40,054 --> 00:09:44,016
Although the cast iron roasting pans do 
pick up around the holidays.

125
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:49,742
When you saw the hamster was terrified,
why didn't you bring it home?

126
00:09:49,743 --> 00:09:54,106
- Cause I don't touch them.
- You put it on the sidewalk.

127
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:58,337
It was in the cage. I flipped it over.
No way I'm touching those things.

128
00:09:58,338 --> 00:10:00,485
- Sugar?
- No, no sugar.

129
00:10:00,486 --> 00:10:04,126
- What kind of cobbler you make?
- Appler and pear.

130
00:10:04,127 --> 00:10:09,610
- Apple and pear?
- Yeah, it's a little recipe of mine. 

131
00:10:09,611 --> 00:10:14,360
- Apple and pear, that's new to me.
- Apple and pear is a classic.

132
00:10:14,361 --> 00:10:16,161
Apple and pear is a classic.

133
00:10:16,162 --> 00:10:18,660
- There's a trick to it.
- Really?

134
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:22,737
You have to cut the pear thicker than the apple,
because they cook faster.

135
00:10:22,738 --> 00:10:25,806
- Oh, right!
- She's not telling you the real secret.

136
00:10:25,807 --> 00:10:28,927
- Let them taste it.
- Very good, very good.

137
00:10:30,202 --> 00:10:32,724
- Delicious!
- Gingerbread crumbs!

138
00:10:32,725 --> 00:10:35,084
Oh my god!

139
00:10:35,119 --> 00:10:39,033
It's just a souped-up recipe, 
his mother gave me this idea.

140
00:10:39,034 --> 00:10:41,633
Gingerbread, fantastic!

141
00:10:42,968 --> 00:10:46,149
At least we get a new recipe out of this, right?

142
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:49,011
I wish my son didn't have to lose two teeth in the process.

143
00:10:49,012 --> 00:10:50,766
Right, that's what I meant.

144
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:54,841
- You have a novel way of expressing it.
- No. I... Excuse me.

145
00:10:55,827 --> 00:10:57,208
Yeah, Walter.

146
00:10:59,557 --> 00:11:02,836
No. No letters to the editor.

147
00:11:04,442 --> 00:11:06,598
You'll just fan the flames.

148
00:11:08,298 --> 00:11:10,644
Was it scheduled? Yeah...

149
00:11:12,602 --> 00:11:15,549
What are these disorders? What's ataxia?

150
00:11:18,695 --> 00:11:20,633
And in normal doses?

151
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,062
How long have you known this?

152
00:11:25,221 --> 00:11:27,352
And in all that time you haven't recalled it?

153
00:11:28,335 --> 00:11:30,621
What are we talking about in revenues?

154
00:11:32,518 --> 00:11:33,699
Oh, oh, I see.

155
00:11:39,347 --> 00:11:44,349
- Alan! We're all waiting for you.
- Yeah, right. One second.

156
00:11:45,351 --> 00:11:46,734
Dennis?

157
00:11:48,287 --> 00:11:51,040
They've known about the risks for two and a half years.

158
00:11:53,277 --> 00:11:59,233
An internal report, but no undesirable side-effects
are firmly established.

159
00:11:59,234 --> 00:12:04,355
No precautionary measures and they don't
schedule a reserve. Nothing in the annual report.

160
00:12:07,073 --> 00:12:12,386
Lack of balance, jerky gait, the works.
Basically, you look like you're drunk.

161
00:12:15,934 --> 00:12:18,720
Roughly half a billion in revenues.

162
00:12:20,423 --> 00:12:21,971
You there?

163
00:12:23,429 --> 00:12:24,783
Deny.

164
00:12:25,902 --> 00:12:30,561
That dumbshit wanted us to write a letter to the editor.
No way we're writing a letter.

165
00:12:30,562 --> 00:12:35,377
On the other hand, if we see this is getting 
picked up, we could do a press release.

166
00:12:35,378 --> 00:12:39,952
Like somebody's spreading false rumors
two weeks out from the A.S.M. kind of thing.

167
00:12:39,953 --> 00:12:42,688
He's calling me back.

168
00:12:44,316 --> 00:12:45,313
OK.

169
00:12:48,636 --> 00:12:50,912
I've been so busy, I hardly had time for lunch.

170
00:12:50,913 --> 00:12:53,612
Help yourself, help yourself.

171
00:12:56,113 --> 00:12:58,547
Go on.

172
00:12:59,972 --> 00:13:03,236
I know I have no manners. Where were we?

173
00:13:03,237 --> 00:13:07,578
We were saying it would be so much nicher
if me meet some other way.

174
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:10,532
- So this cobbler, your mother, huh?
- His mother.

175
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:12,812
It's my mother's recipe but Pen made it.

176
00:13:12,813 --> 00:13:16,146
- Your mother doesn't use apples and pears.
- No.

177
00:13:16,147 --> 00:13:20,708
- She's about to have an operation, poor thing.
- Really? What for?

178
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:21,673
Her knee.

179
00:13:21,674 --> 00:13:24,660
She's going to get a polythylene and metallic prostheses.

180
00:13:24,661 --> 00:13:28,837
She's wondering what's going to be left
of it after the cremation.

181
00:13:28,838 --> 00:13:30,567
Michael, that's mean.

182
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,713
She doesn't want to be buried with my father. 
She wants to be cremated,

183
00:13:33,714 --> 00:13:36,690
And put upstate next to her mother,
who's all alone.

184
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:40,794
A couple of urns jabbering away on the 
shores of Lake Sebago. [Laugh]

185
00:13:44,162 --> 00:13:47,441
We're very touched by how generous you're being.

186
00:13:47,442 --> 00:13:52,089
We realize how you're trying to smooth things
out here instead of making them worse.

187
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,908
- Please, it's the least we could do.
- Yeah.

188
00:13:56,297 --> 00:14:02,343
No, come on. So many parents just take their
kid's side, acting like children themselves.

189
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:08,612
If Ethan had broken two of Zachary's teeth, I'm
thinking Alan and I might have had more of a knee-jerk reaction.

190
00:14:08,613 --> 00:14:11,143
- I'm not sure we would see the big picture.
- Sure you would.

191
00:14:11,144 --> 00:14:13,425
She's right. I'm not so sure.

192
00:14:13,426 --> 00:14:16,328
You would. Because we all know it could have
happened the other way around.

193
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,438
So what does Zachary say?

194
00:14:19,439 --> 00:14:21,949
How is he experiencing this?

195
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,816
He doesn't talk much. A little overwhelmed I guess.

196
00:14:24,817 --> 00:14:27,374
But he realizes that he disfigured his schoolmate?

197
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:32,020
No. No, he doesn't realize that he disfigured
his schoolmate.

198
00:14:32,021 --> 00:14:35,279
Why do you say that?
Of course Zachary realizes.

199
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:40,476
He realizes that this violent behavior is unacceptable,
not that he disfigured his schoolmate.

200
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:42,688
You don't like the word but unfortunately
the word is appropriate.

201
00:14:42,689 --> 00:14:45,221
My son did not disfigure your son.

202
00:14:45,222 --> 00:14:46,792
Your son disfigured our son!

203
00:14:46,793 --> 00:14:49,184
Come back after school, look at his mouth and teeth.

204
00:14:49,185 --> 00:14:52,518
- Momentarily disfigured.
- His mouth will be fine when the swelling goes down.

205
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:56,058
As for the teeth, if he needs it, we'd be willing 
to chip in for the best dental care...

206
00:14:56,059 --> 00:14:57,521
We got insurance for that.

207
00:14:57,522 --> 00:15:01,798
What we want is for the boys to patch it up,
make sure nothing like this ever happens again.

208
00:15:01,832 --> 00:15:04,343
- Let's set up a meeting.
- Yeah. Exactly.

209
00:15:04,344 --> 00:15:08,102
- Should we be there?
- They don't need coaching. Let them work it out like men.

210
00:15:08,103 --> 00:15:10,067
Like men? Alan, don't be rediculous.

211
00:15:10,068 --> 00:15:12,250
On the other hand, 
maybe we don't need to be there.

212
00:15:12,251 --> 00:15:14,787
Maybe it's better if we weren't there, right?

213
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:17,431
The issue is not whether we are there,
whether we are not there.

214
00:15:17,432 --> 00:15:21,284
The issue is, do they want to talk about this,
do they want to work this out.

215
00:15:21,285 --> 00:15:22,976
- Ethan does.
- Does Zachary?

216
00:15:22,977 --> 00:15:26,075
- We won't give him a choice.
- It has to come from him.

217
00:15:26,109 --> 00:15:29,244
Zachary acts like a thug, we're not going to wait
around for him to see the light.

218
00:15:29,245 --> 00:15:34,162
If Zachary sees Ethan in a punitive context,
because he's forced to,

219
00:15:34,197 --> 00:15:37,515
I just don't see anything positive coming out of that.

220
00:15:37,516 --> 00:15:39,832
Mrs. Longstreet, our son is a maniac.

221
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:44,421
If you hope he'll suddenly and spontaneously
get all apologetic, you're dreaming.

222
00:15:44,422 --> 00:15:47,427
Look, I'm sorry, but I really do have 
to get back to the office.

223
00:15:47,428 --> 00:15:49,865
Nancy, you stay. 
You'll let me know what was decided.

224
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,622
I'm no use to anyone anyway.

225
00:15:51,623 --> 00:15:54,308
Women think you need the man,
you need the father,

226
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:55,875
like it would do any good.

227
00:15:55,876 --> 00:15:58,282
I'm really sorry, but I can't stay either.

228
00:15:58,283 --> 00:16:01,897
My husband has never been much of
an I'll-push-the-stroller type daddy.

229
00:16:01,898 --> 00:16:04,147
That's too bad, because it goes by so fast.

230
00:16:04,148 --> 00:16:06,264
Mike really liked taking care of the kids.

231
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:09,287
- You had a ball pushing that stroller.
- Yeah, sure.

232
00:16:09,288 --> 00:16:11,286
So... What should we decide?

233
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:15,291
Could you come over to our place at
about 7:30, with Ethan?

234
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:17,281
7:30? What do you think, Mike?

235
00:16:17,282 --> 00:16:20,726
- Well, if you want my opinion...
- Yes, please.

236
00:16:20,727 --> 00:16:24,267
- I think Zachary should come over here.
- Yeah, I agree.

237
00:16:24,268 --> 00:16:26,364
The victim shouldn't be the one 
who makes the trip.

238
00:16:26,365 --> 00:16:31,608
- I can't be anywhere at 7:30.
- Who needs you? You're useless, right?

239
00:16:31,609 --> 00:16:36,046
- Seriously, I think it's important for his father to come.
- Not tonight!

240
00:16:37,446 --> 00:16:41,087
- I'm sorry.
- Can you hear me? Can you hear me now?

241
00:16:44,996 --> 00:16:47,174
There's not a word in the annual report.

242
00:16:47,175 --> 00:16:50,763
But the risk wasn't officially established.
There's no proof.

243
00:16:50,764 --> 00:16:52,928
Call me back.

244
00:16:52,963 --> 00:16:57,257
- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow I'm in Washington.

245
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,693
- You have business in Washington?
- At the Pentagon.

246
00:16:59,694 --> 00:17:02,353
Look, the main thing is to get the kids to talk.

247
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:06,643
I'll come over to your place with Zachary at 7:30
and we'll let them talk it through.

248
00:17:07,488 --> 00:17:10,086
What? You don't seem convinced.

249
00:17:10,087 --> 00:17:13,831
If Zachary hasn't acquired 
accountability skills,

250
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:16,010
They'll just glare at each other,
it will be disaster.

251
00:17:16,011 --> 00:17:18,612
"Accountability skills", Mrs. Longstreet?
What are you talking about?

252
00:17:18,647 --> 00:17:21,214
I'm sure your son is not a maniac.

253
00:17:21,215 --> 00:17:24,520
- Zachary is not a maniac.
- Yes he is.

254
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:26,743
Alan, don't be an idiot.
Why are you saying that?

255
00:17:26,744 --> 00:17:27,950
He's a maniac.

256
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:30,573
- How does he explain what he did?
- He won't talk about it.

257
00:17:30,574 --> 00:17:33,806
- He should talk about it.
- That's a lot of "shoulds", Mrs. Longstreet.

258
00:17:33,807 --> 00:17:36,656
He should come here, he should talk about it,
he should feel sorry...

259
00:17:36,657 --> 00:17:38,728
I'm sure you're much more evolved than we are.

260
00:17:38,729 --> 00:17:41,812
We're trying to get up to speed,
but in the meantime try to indulge us.

261
00:17:43,186 --> 00:17:46,104
Hey come on! What happened here?

262
00:17:46,105 --> 00:17:48,244
This isn't what we are all about.

263
00:17:48,245 --> 00:17:51,220
- I was talking about Zachary, about him.
- I got that.

264
00:17:51,221 --> 00:17:52,194
Alan!

265
00:17:53,184 --> 00:17:56,086
You want some more coffee? Real coffee.

266
00:17:56,087 --> 00:17:57,661
Coffee.

267
00:17:59,057 --> 00:18:00,481
Thank you.

268
00:18:01,621 --> 00:18:05,583
- Coffee, all right.
- It's OK, I'll get it.

269
00:18:42,177 --> 00:18:44,747
I see you're an art enthusiast.

270
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,448
Yes.

271
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:51,856
- Bacon?
- Yes, bacon.

272
00:19:09,239 --> 00:19:13,835
- Cruelty and splendor.
- Chaos. Balance.

273
00:19:17,012 --> 00:19:21,002
- Is Zachary interested in art?
- Not as much as he should be.

274
00:19:21,003 --> 00:19:25,623
- Your children are?
- We try to make up for the lack in the school curriculum.

275
00:19:27,471 --> 00:19:29,837
We try to get them to read, 
to concerts and galleries.

276
00:19:31,099 --> 00:19:34,622
I really believe that culture can be
a powerful force for peace.

277
00:19:34,657 --> 00:19:36,060
Yeah you're so right.

278
00:19:36,061 --> 00:19:38,972
Is cobbler cake or pie?
This is an important question.

279
00:19:38,973 --> 00:19:42,999
I was in the kitchen, thinking.
Why should pizza be a pie?

280
00:19:43,032 --> 00:19:46,975
N�o deixe isto sobrar!

281
00:19:46,976 --> 00:19:49,023
Have that.

282
00:19:49,024 --> 00:19:52,424
Cobbler is cake. It there's no crust on 
the bottom then it can't be pie.

283
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:54,491
You're a gourmet chef.

284
00:19:54,492 --> 00:19:58,476
I like to cook. It's something you have to 
do out of love or not at all.

285
00:19:59,303 --> 00:20:03,061
The way I see it, if there's no curst on the bottom,
then it's not a pie.

286
00:20:03,062 --> 00:20:05,847
How about you guys? You have other kids?

287
00:20:05,848 --> 00:20:08,636
I have another son by a former marriage.

288
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:15,273
You know, I was wondering.
I know it's not important but...

289
00:20:15,274 --> 00:20:18,093
Do you know what were they arguing about?

290
00:20:18,094 --> 00:20:19,372
Cause Ethan won't say a word.

291
00:20:19,373 --> 00:20:21,814
Ethan wouldn't let Zachary be 
part of his gang.

292
00:20:21,815 --> 00:20:24,692
- Ethan has a gang?
- And he called him a snitch.

293
00:20:24,693 --> 00:20:26,471
Did you know that Ethan had a gang?

294
00:20:26,472 --> 00:20:29,472
No. But I'm thrilled to hear it!

295
00:20:29,507 --> 00:20:32,472
- Why are you thrilled?
- Cause I had one.

296
00:20:32,473 --> 00:20:34,181
- I was the leader.
- So was I.

297
00:20:34,216 --> 00:20:35,889
What does the leader of a gang do?

298
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:41,113
You know, you got five, six guys who like you and
they're willing to sacrifice themselves for you.

299
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:44,482
- Like in Ivanhoe.
- Exactly, like in Ivanhoe.

300
00:20:44,483 --> 00:20:46,154
Who even knows Ivanhoe any more?

301
00:20:46,155 --> 00:20:49,367
So it's another role model. Like Spiderman 
or whoever.

302
00:20:49,368 --> 00:20:51,619
Well apparently you know more about
it than we do.

303
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:55,220
Zachary wasn't quite as silent as you first said.

304
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:57,806
Why did he call him a snitch?

305
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,983
Forget it, silly question, right?
What's the point? No one care.

306
00:21:02,984 --> 00:21:05,701
We're not going to get into these
children's quarrels.

307
00:21:05,702 --> 00:21:06,978
- It's none of our business.
- Right.

308
00:21:06,979 --> 00:21:09,886
What is our business is this unfortunate incident.

309
00:21:09,887 --> 00:21:11,371
Violence is our business.

310
00:21:11,372 --> 00:21:13,470
When I was the leader,

311
00:21:13,571 --> 00:21:16,967
I beat up Jimmy Leach in a fair fight
and he was bigger than me.

312
00:21:16,968 --> 00:21:21,767
- What does that do with anything, Michael?
- No, nothing.

313
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,834
This is not a fair fight, these boys weren't fighting.


314
00:21:23,835 --> 00:21:28,778
- Right, I was just remembering something.
- It's not very different.

315
00:21:28,812 --> 00:21:31,794
- Excuse me, I'm sorry there's a difference.
- There's a difference.

316
00:21:31,828 --> 00:21:33,217
What's the difference?

317
00:21:33,218 --> 00:21:35,106
Jimmy Leach and me, we agreed to fight.

318
00:21:35,107 --> 00:21:37,452
- Did you mess him up?
- A little.

319
00:21:37,453 --> 00:21:39,512
Enough about Jimmy Leach.

320
00:21:40,854 --> 00:21:44,518
- Do you mind if I talked to Zachary?
- Of course not.

321
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:49,630
- I would not do it without your permission.
- No, talk to him. That's completely fine with us.

322
00:21:49,631 --> 00:21:51,995
- And good luck with that.
- Stop it.

323
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:54,738
Why did you say that?

324
00:21:54,739 --> 00:21:58,803
- Mrs. Longstreet...
- Penelope. I think we'll do better if we're 
on a first name basis.

325
00:21:59,768 --> 00:22:04,841
- Penelope, you're acting on a desire to educate...
- I won't talk to him if you don't want me to.

326
00:22:04,932 --> 00:22:07,990
Go ahead, talk to him, lecture him,
do whatever you want.

327
00:22:07,991 --> 00:22:11,205
I don't understand how you
feel so uninvolved here.

328
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:12,992
- Mrs. Longstreet...
- Penelope.

329
00:22:13,793 --> 00:22:16,592
Penelope, I'm very involved here.

330
00:22:16,593 --> 00:22:19,056
- My son injured another child...
- Deliberately.

331
00:22:19,057 --> 00:22:22,522
See, that's the kind of thing that irks me.
We know deliberately.

332
00:22:22,523 --> 00:22:23,802
That's what makes all the difference.

333
00:22:23,803 --> 00:22:26,362
The difference between what and what?
We're only talking about one thing here.

334
00:22:26,363 --> 00:22:29,493
Our kid picked up a stick and hit your kid.
That's why we're here, right?

335
00:22:29,494 --> 00:22:33,296
- Fruitless.
- Right, she's right. This kind of talk is fruitless.

336
00:22:33,297 --> 00:22:37,826
Why do you feel you need to slip in the word
deliberately? What kind of lesson are you 
trying to teach me?

337
00:22:37,827 --> 00:22:40,366
All right, this is getting silly.

338
00:22:40,367 --> 00:22:43,117
My husband is all stressed out over work stuff.

339
00:22:43,118 --> 00:22:46,281
I'll come back here tonight with Zachary and
we'll let them work it out naturally.

340
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:49,449
- I'm not stressed out in the least.
- Well I am.

341
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,149
- There's no reason to be stressed out.
- Yes, there is.

342
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,194
Yeah.

343
00:22:56,722 --> 00:22:59,172
Well, no comment...No comment.

344
00:23:01,534 --> 00:23:03,126
No comment!

345
00:23:06,001 --> 00:23:09,075
What? If you recall it, you're admitting liability!

346
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:15,358
Recalling Antril would be admitting your liability!

347
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:17,849
Christmas time in the school play...

348
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:21,971
- What did Zachary play? Zachary played...
- Ebenezer Scrooge.

349
00:23:21,972 --> 00:23:24,968
- [Alan] accused of accounting irregularities...
- Ebenezer Scrooge, right.

350
00:23:24,969 --> 00:23:26,844
If you want them to haul you out of 
the meeting in handcuffs two weeks from now...

351
00:23:26,845 --> 00:23:29,879
Michael, do you remember he played Scrooge?

352
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,170
- Sure.
- He was wonderful.

353
00:23:33,171 --> 00:23:35,374
With that night bonnet. He was very funny.

354
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:38,531
Let's talk about it, what about the victims
after the stockholders' meeting...

355
00:23:38,532 --> 00:23:43,701
What did Ethan play, he played the...

356
00:23:45,026 --> 00:23:48,849
We can't recall a drug because three
guys can't walk a straight line!

357
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:51,988
For the time being, don't make a move.

358
00:23:53,821 --> 00:23:56,320
All right, call you right back.

359
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:07,017
They're in panic mode. They have the media
breathing down their necks.

360
00:24:07,018 --> 00:24:08,171
All right.

361
00:24:09,007 --> 00:24:12,362
I want a release thant doesn't 
sound defensive at all.

362
00:24:12,363 --> 00:24:14,779
Just the opposite. Go for the jugular.

363
00:24:14,814 --> 00:24:18,114
Something like: "TW Pharma is a target."

364
00:24:18,115 --> 00:24:22,504
"Attempt at manipulation of the stock two
weeks before the stockholders' meeting."

365
00:24:23,476 --> 00:24:29,186
" Where did this study come from anyway?"
"How does this suddenly drop out of a clear blue
sky", etcetera.

366
00:24:29,187 --> 00:24:30,980
Not one word about the health issue.

367
00:24:30,981 --> 00:24:34,793
Just one question: 
Who is behind the study? Who?

368
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:37,426
Fine.

369
00:24:38,295 --> 00:24:40,631
As empresas farmac�uticas
s�o bem dif�ceis de manter.

370
00:24:40,632 --> 00:24:42,903
Profit, profit, profit.

371
00:24:42,904 --> 00:24:46,298
Nobody said you should listen to my conversation.

372
00:24:46,299 --> 00:24:49,221
Nobody said you should have it under my nose.

373
00:24:50,093 --> 00:24:53,796
I'm totally forced to have it here.
Against my will, believe me.

374
00:24:54,711 --> 00:24:57,246
They just peddle this shit, right?
No one is responsible.

375
00:24:57,247 --> 00:25:00,395
In any therapeutic advance there are
benefits and there are risks.

376
00:25:00,396 --> 00:25:05,621
Yeah, I know. Still you got some funny line of work.

377
00:25:06,708 --> 00:25:09,712
- What does that mean?
- Michael, it's none of our business.

378
00:25:09,713 --> 00:25:12,907
- Funny line of work.
- What about you, what do you do?

379
00:25:12,908 --> 00:25:16,079
- I got a normal job.
- What's a normal job?

380
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,253
- I told you, I sell pots and pans.
- And door handles.

381
00:25:19,254 --> 00:25:22,049
And flush mechanisms. And lot of other stuff.

382
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:25,281
"Flush mechanisms", I like that,
That's interesting.

383
00:25:27,601 --> 00:25:30,137
I find that interesting. 
Flush toilets are interesting.

384
00:25:30,138 --> 00:25:31,437
Why not?

385
00:25:31,438 --> 00:25:34,173
- How many different kinds do you have?
- There are two basic kinds.

386
00:25:34,174 --> 00:25:36,271
You got your push button and your handle operated.

387
00:25:36,272 --> 00:25:39,573
- Yeah, right.
- Depends where your water line is.

388
00:25:39,607 --> 00:25:42,798
- I see.
- It either comes from the side near the top,
or it comes from the bottom.

389
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,932
One of my store managers is an expert.
I could introduce you if you want.

390
00:25:45,933 --> 00:25:48,087
But you'll have to hump it out to Jamaica, Queens.

391
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,231
You seem like you know your business pretty well.

392
00:25:50,232 --> 00:25:53,186
Are you planning to sanction Zachary in any way?

393
00:25:53,187 --> 00:25:55,993
Depois discutem sobre tubula��o.

394
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,345
- I don't feel well.
- What's the matter, are you all right?

395
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:03,086
- Oh you do look pale honey.
- You're all white, yeah.

396
00:26:07,284 --> 00:26:10,614
- Nauseous.
- Some Reglan, you get some Reglan?

397
00:26:10,615 --> 00:26:14,574
- No. I'll be fine.
- Coke. What you need is a coke.

398
00:26:30,508 --> 00:26:31,892
It's not cold.

399
00:26:34,115 --> 00:26:35,998
- It's not cold.
- Thank you.

400
00:26:35,999 --> 00:26:39,937
Just little sips.
The coke wasn't in the refrigerator.

401
00:26:41,175 --> 00:26:43,430
Have him call me back.
Tell him right away.

402
00:26:45,711 --> 00:26:48,586
Is Coke good for that?
It's more for diarrhea, isn't it?

403
00:26:48,587 --> 00:26:51,131
No, not only. Better?

404
00:26:55,891 --> 00:26:57,159
I think so.

405
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,779
Mrs. Longstreet...

406
00:27:01,569 --> 00:27:07,764
If we decide to reprimand our child, we'll do
it in our own way and on our own terms.

407
00:27:07,815 --> 00:27:10,238
- Absolutely.
- What absolutely?

408
00:27:10,239 --> 00:27:12,062
He's their kid, they're free to do as they see fit.

409
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:14,007
- I don't agree.
- You don't agree about what, Penny?

410
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:17,325
- They're not free.
- Is that right? Go on.

411
00:27:22,526 --> 00:27:26,401
But don't forget, nothing has been proven here,
nothing is certain.

412
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,063
Don't fuck this up.

413
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:32,711
If we don't get this right, Walter will be
out on his ear in two weeks, and so will we.

414
00:27:32,712 --> 00:27:37,246
Enough, Alan! Enough with the cell phone already!
The here and now, god dammit!

415
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,949
Call me back and read it to me.

416
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,692
What the hell is wrong with you?
Screaming at me like that!

417
00:27:42,693 --> 00:27:47,621
- Dennis heard every word!
- Good! I'm sick of that fucking cell phone,
every minute of every day!

418
00:27:47,655 --> 00:27:50,827
Listen Nancy, you should be thanking me
for agreeing to come here...

419
00:27:50,828 --> 00:27:52,047
Really?

420
00:27:52,738 --> 00:27:54,583
- I'm going to throw up.
- No you're not.

421
00:27:54,584 --> 00:27:56,783
- I am.
- You want to use the bathroom?

422
00:27:56,784 --> 00:28:00,346
- Nobody's forcing you to stay...
- She's right, nobody's forcing you to stay.

423
00:28:00,348 --> 00:28:04,614
- I'm dizzy.
- Stare at a point in space. Stare at a point in space.

424
00:28:04,705 --> 00:28:08,280
- Hey, you can see part of the EL from here. Cool!
- Get away from me. Leave me alone.

425
00:28:08,281 --> 00:28:12,654
- Should she go to the bathroom?
- Go to the bathroom if you have to throw up.

426
00:28:12,655 --> 00:28:15,334
- Give her some Reglan.
- It can't be the cobbler, can it?

427
00:28:15,335 --> 00:28:17,514
- No, I made it yesterday.
- Don't touch me!

428
00:28:17,515 --> 00:28:21,856
- Take it easy, Doodle.
- Come on, don't get all bent out of shape over nothing.

429
00:28:21,889 --> 00:28:25,786
My husband feels that anything to do with the 
house, the school, the backyard,

430
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,761
- ...is my domain.
- I do not.

431
00:28:27,762 --> 00:28:33,002
You do so. And I can understand why.
It's all so excruciatingly boring.

432
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,221
It's excruciating.

433
00:28:34,222 --> 00:28:36,667
If it's so excruciating, why do you have
children in the first place?

434
00:28:36,668 --> 00:28:39,288
Maybe Zachary picks up on that lack of interest.

435
00:28:40,036 --> 00:28:43,310
- What lack of interest?!
- You just said it yourself!

436
00:28:45,036 --> 00:28:46,996
Go get a bucket, go get a bucket!

437
00:28:56,297 --> 00:28:57,300
That stupid bitch.

438
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:01,115
You should have gone to the bathroom.
Doodle, this is rediculous.

439
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:02,614
- Your suit took a hit.
- What?

440
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:06,885
- It can't be the cobbler. That much I know.
- It's not the cobbler, it's nerves. This is just nerves.

441
00:29:06,886 --> 00:29:09,337
You want to clean up in the bathroom?

442
00:29:12,066 --> 00:29:14,264
Oh my god, my Kokoschka.

443
00:29:18,516 --> 00:29:21,540
- Give her some Reglan.
- She couldn't keep anything down right now.

444
00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:23,176
Where's the bathroom?

445
00:29:24,823 --> 00:29:26,061
I'll show you.

446
00:29:32,067 --> 00:29:33,936
This is nerves, just nerves.

447
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:47,849
Thank you.

448
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:51,858
Like I always say, you can't get over
something when you're under it.

449
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:55,348
With me it's the back of my neck.
Gets all blocked up right here.

450
00:29:56,737 --> 00:29:59,995
- What do we do about the Kokoschka?
- We can clean it.

451
00:29:59,996 --> 00:30:05,720
Try Lysol. Only problem is drying it. Or else with 
plain water and you put some cologne on there.

452
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:08,777
- Cologne?
- I got some of that Kronos I never use.

453
00:30:08,778 --> 00:30:10,970
The paper will warp.

454
00:30:10,971 --> 00:30:13,880
We'll blow-dry it, then put some books on top

455
00:30:13,881 --> 00:30:14,986
then flatten it out. Maybe iron it like dollar bills.

456
00:30:14,987 --> 00:30:17,571
Maybe iron it like dollar bills.

457
00:30:18,765 --> 00:30:20,749
- Oh God!
- I'll buy you another one.

458
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,165
There's no other one. It's been out of print for years.

459
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:25,452
- I'm so sorry.
- We can save it.

460
00:30:25,453 --> 00:30:27,129
Pen, let me do this.

461
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:29,778
It's a reprint from the catalog of 
the 1963 show in London.

462
00:30:29,779 --> 00:30:32,662
Go get the blow-dryer and the cologne.
It's in the bathroom cabinet.

463
00:30:32,663 --> 00:30:36,552
- Her husband is in the bathroom!
- He's not in the can!

464
00:30:36,637 --> 00:30:39,757
I got most of it off. Little bit on the Dolgans...

465
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:50,389
Excuse me!

466
00:31:13,682 --> 00:31:15,993
- Are you feeling better?
- Yeah.

467
00:31:15,994 --> 00:31:19,147
- Should I spray?
- Where's the blow-dryer?

468
00:31:19,148 --> 00:31:20,919
He's drying his pants.

469
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,164
Well, we'll wait. We'll put the Kouros on there last.

470
00:31:24,996 --> 00:31:28,726
- Can I use the bathroom too?
- Yes, of course. Of course.

471
00:31:34,754 --> 00:31:36,781
I don't know what to say...

472
00:31:37,878 --> 00:31:39,870
I am so sorry.

473
00:31:48,762 --> 00:31:51,110
Bring the blow-dryer please.

474
00:31:51,846 --> 00:31:52,957
God!

475
00:31:54,574 --> 00:31:56,033
Unbelievable!

476
00:31:57,024 --> 00:31:59,287
Un-fucking-believable.

477
00:32:00,438 --> 00:32:05,357
- Her cobbler is horrible.
- You stuffed your face!

478
00:32:06,755 --> 00:32:09,952
Look at my day. I have to get
some food in me some time.

479
00:32:22,527 --> 00:32:26,247
- Oh God.
- What a freaking nightmare!

480
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:29,600
He better watch it, he's got me
right on the edge.

481
00:32:29,601 --> 00:32:32,394
- She's horrible!
- Less.

482
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,840
She's so fake.

483
00:32:34,528 --> 00:32:37,077
- She doesn't bother me that much.
- They're both horrible.

484
00:32:37,078 --> 00:32:39,431
Why do you take their side all the time?

485
00:32:40,218 --> 00:32:42,589
- Sorry.
- I don't take their side. What's that supposed to mean?

486
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,840
What the hell are we doing here?

487
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:49,410
- I hope you're kidding.
- Why do you argue with her?

488
00:32:49,443 --> 00:32:53,973
We'd have been out of here a long time 
ago if you didn't bicker over every word.

489
00:32:53,974 --> 00:32:57,184
You'd rather I was a sheep, like her husband?

490
00:32:57,185 --> 00:33:00,613
- You think it was the cobbler?
- Of course it was.

491
00:33:03,174 --> 00:33:05,320
A little warm coke and... Bang!

492
00:33:07,601 --> 00:33:08,652
Fuck!

493
00:33:09,203 --> 00:33:12,376
You mitigate. You're trying to reconcile everything.

494
00:33:12,377 --> 00:33:13,848
- I'm not!
- You are.

495
00:33:13,849 --> 00:33:18,602
You had your gang and you were the leader,
and they can do whatever they want with their son.

496
00:33:18,603 --> 00:33:20,664
Their son is a threat to homeland security.

497
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:24,005
When a kid is a menace to society
it's everybody's business.

498
00:33:24,006 --> 00:33:27,786
I can't believe she barfed all over my books!

499
00:33:27,787 --> 00:33:31,663
When you know you're going to toss your
cookies, you take precautions.

500
00:33:33,307 --> 00:33:37,059
Oh, the Foujita! Disgusting...

501
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,652
I was right on the edge with that
toilet flushing shit.

502
00:33:39,653 --> 00:33:42,414
- You were incredible.
- I held my own, right?

503
00:33:42,415 --> 00:33:46,365
Incredible. "Jamaica, Queens", that was genius.

504
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,996
- Little piece of shit. What does he call her again?
- Doodle.

505
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,330
- Doodle...
- Doodle!

506
00:33:52,331 --> 00:33:54,343
Yeah, I call her Doodle.

507
00:33:56,549 --> 00:33:59,746
Oh, I'm sorry. We didn't mean anything.

508
00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:03,196
It's just so easy to make fun of other
people's pet names.

509
00:34:03,197 --> 00:34:06,532
Michael, what do we call each other?
I'm sure it's worse, right?

510
00:34:06,533 --> 00:34:09,786
- Here, you want the blow-dryer.
- Thanks.

511
00:34:09,787 --> 00:34:13,090
We call each other darjeeling, like the tea.

512
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,763
A lot more embarrassing if you ask me.

513
00:34:18,642 --> 00:34:21,841
- How's she feeling, is she feeling better?
- Yeah, better.

514
00:34:21,842 --> 00:34:26,657
I reacted badly. I'm ashamed.

515
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:35,048
I made a big deal about the catalog.
I didn't really know why I did that.

516
00:34:35,082 --> 00:34:39,300
You get so absurdly attached to these things,
you don't even know why really.

517
00:34:39,301 --> 00:34:41,588
- Pull it taut.
- Hold on at the other side.

518
00:34:41,589 --> 00:34:44,912
I know I got it, just pull it taut.

519
00:34:44,913 --> 00:34:47,267
- The corners are wet.
- I know, I get the corners.

520
00:34:47,268 --> 00:34:50,912
- It's gonna tear.
- He's right, it gonna tear.

521
00:34:50,972 --> 00:34:52,683
- Here.
- It's dry now.

522
00:34:52,684 --> 00:34:55,570
You put colognes right now and I finish those.

523
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,745
- What does Doodle come from?
- Sorry.

524
00:35:00,746 --> 00:35:03,153
Yankee Doodle? Cheese Doodle?

525
00:35:03,154 --> 00:35:06,872
No, it's a song from Guys and Dolls
that goes, "Doodle oodle oodle oo."

526
00:35:06,873 --> 00:35:08,429
Oh yeah, I know that one.

527
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,657
Ours is from our honeynoon in India.

528
00:35:17,658 --> 00:35:21,070
I called her darjeeling instead of darling.

529
00:35:21,071 --> 00:35:22,584
So stupid.

530
00:35:23,722 --> 00:35:27,340
- Should I go check on her?
- Go ahead, darjeeling.

531
00:35:27,341 --> 00:35:29,190
Nancy!

532
00:35:30,552 --> 00:35:32,717
I was worried about you, all better?

533
00:35:32,718 --> 00:35:35,455
Yeah, better, I think so.

534
00:35:35,456 --> 00:35:38,889
If you're not sure, stay away from the coffee table.

535
00:35:41,888 --> 00:35:45,277
I left the towel in the bathtub.
I didn't know where to put it.

536
00:35:45,278 --> 00:35:46,613
Perfect.

537
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,713
You cleaned up? I'm so sorry.

538
00:35:51,714 --> 00:35:53,783
Everything is fine. All is well.

539
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:57,698
I'm sorry, I wasn't there for you.
I was so focused on my Kokoschka.

540
00:35:57,732 --> 00:35:58,759
That's all right.

541
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,496
- No, I behaved poorly.
- Please.

542
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:13,787
In the bathroom I was thinking.

543
00:36:14,678 --> 00:36:15,726
Yes?

544
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:22,141
Maybe we glossed over the...

545
00:36:22,142 --> 00:36:25,485
- Well I mean...
- What? What is it?

546
00:36:27,971 --> 00:36:30,947
- Name-calling is a kind of abuse.
- Sure.

547
00:36:30,948 --> 00:36:33,984
- Depends.
- Right, depends.

548
00:36:33,985 --> 00:36:37,842
Zachary has never been a violent child.
He must have his reasons.

549
00:36:37,843 --> 00:36:41,125
Like getting called a snitch. Excuse me.

550
00:36:43,657 --> 00:36:44,878
Yeah, Walter.

551
00:36:49,603 --> 00:36:54,449
As long as there are no victims on the panel. 
No victims. I don't want you sitting down with victims.

552
00:36:55,306 --> 00:36:59,232
Deny, deny, deny. If we have to,
we'll sue the Journal.

553
00:36:59,993 --> 00:37:02,886
We'll e-mail you the draft of the press release,

554
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,420
Walter, I'm sorry I got to go.

555
00:37:06,228 --> 00:37:08,424
Call me a snitch, it gets a rise out of me.

556
00:37:08,425 --> 00:37:10,196
- Unless it's ture.
- What?

557
00:37:10,197 --> 00:37:11,881
You know, the shoe fits.

558
00:37:12,601 --> 00:37:15,178
- You think my son is a snitch?
- Come on, joking around.

559
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:17,863
- So is yours anyway.
- What do you mean so is ours?

560
00:37:17,864 --> 00:37:20,675
- He snitched on Zachary.
- We coaxed it out of him.

561
00:37:20,676 --> 00:37:24,650
- We're completely off point here.
- Maybe you coaxed, but he did snitch on him.

562
00:37:24,685 --> 00:37:26,432
- Nancy...
- Nancy what?

563
00:37:26,433 --> 00:37:30,061
- You think my son is a snitch?
- I don't think anything.

564
00:37:30,062 --> 00:37:34,213
Well if you don't think anything, don't say anything.
Don't make insinuations.

565
00:37:34,214 --> 00:37:36,899
Nancy, there's no reason to lose our cool here.

566
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:40,481
Michael and I have gone out of our way
to be fair-minded and conciliating...

567
00:37:40,482 --> 00:37:43,148
- Not so fair-minded.
- Oh, really?

568
00:37:43,149 --> 00:37:47,044
- Superficially fair-minded.
- Doodle, I have to go.

569
00:37:47,045 --> 00:37:49,473
So go, coward.

570
00:37:49,923 --> 00:37:53,239
Nancy, right now I'm in danger of 
losing my most important client.

571
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,765
So this caring parent crap and the brickering
that goes along with it...

572
00:37:56,766 --> 00:38:00,340
- My son lost two teeth. Two incisors.
- Yeah, right, we got that.

573
00:38:00,341 --> 00:38:03,421
- One of them permanently.
- He'll get new teeth.

574
00:38:03,422 --> 00:38:05,923
Better ones! No one chewed his ear off!

575
00:38:05,924 --> 00:38:08,948
It was a mistake not to consider the 
source of the problem.

576
00:38:08,949 --> 00:38:12,761
There is no source. There's an 11-year-old
kid who hits people, with a stick!

577
00:38:12,762 --> 00:38:15,017
- Armed with a stick.
- We took that word out.

578
00:38:15,018 --> 00:38:18,048
- You took it out because we asked you to.
- We took it out without argument.

579
00:38:18,049 --> 00:38:21,981
A word which deliberately establishes intent
and excludes any hint of a misunderstanding.

580
00:38:21,982 --> 00:38:24,282
Which excludes childhood.

581
00:38:24,283 --> 00:38:29,852
- I don't think I can stand this tone any more.
- We're not quite on the same page, you and I. Right from the start.

582
00:38:29,853 --> 00:38:35,339
Mr. Cowan, it is incredibly frustrating
to be continued upbraided

583
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:38,299
For something we ourselves admitted was a mistake.

584
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,510
Like the word "armed" wasn't right,
we took it out.

585
00:38:40,511 --> 00:38:43,511
Strictly speaking, it certainly applies.

586
00:38:43,512 --> 00:38:45,724
Zachary was verbally abused and over reacted.

587
00:38:45,725 --> 00:38:47,723
If I'm attacked, I defend myself.

588
00:38:47,724 --> 00:38:50,172
Especially when I'm all alone against a whole gang.

589
00:38:50,173 --> 00:38:53,135
Well, you've certainly perked up since 
you tossed your cookies.

590
00:38:53,136 --> 00:38:55,344
Do you realize how crude that is?

591
00:38:55,345 --> 00:38:58,210
We're all decent people. All four of us.

592
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:01,650
How do we get all carried away, losing 
our tempers? It's totally unnecessary.

593
00:39:01,651 --> 00:39:03,764
Michael, stop, stop metigating.

594
00:39:03,765 --> 00:39:06,687
We're only superficially fair-minded,
why should we be fair-minded at all?

595
00:39:06,688 --> 00:39:09,418
- I'm not going to be led down that path.
- What path?

596
00:39:09,419 --> 00:39:12,366
The path those two little shits led us down!
All right?

597
00:39:12,367 --> 00:39:14,610
- I'm afraid Pen doesn't see things that way...
- Penelope.

598
00:39:14,611 --> 00:39:17,051
- Sorry.
- So Ethan is a shit now.

599
00:39:17,052 --> 00:39:19,453
That really takes the cake.

600
00:39:20,065 --> 00:39:23,382
- That's it. I really have to leave now.
- Yeah so do I.

601
00:39:23,383 --> 00:39:26,406
Go, go. I give up.

602
00:39:29,466 --> 00:39:30,501
Hello?

603
00:39:32,052 --> 00:39:33,685
Oh, hi Ma.

604
00:39:34,347 --> 00:39:37,245
No, we got some friends over but go ahead.

605
00:39:40,094 --> 00:39:43,426
Yes, you just do whatever the doctors tell you to do.

606
00:39:43,427 --> 00:39:44,614
Yes.

607
00:39:51,509 --> 00:39:52,737
The what?

608
00:39:55,197 --> 00:40:00,556
Antril? You're taking Antril... Hold on a second.

609
00:40:01,246 --> 00:40:03,952
Antril? That crap of yours, is that Antril?

610
00:40:03,953 --> 00:40:06,671
- My mother's taking it.
- Thousands of people take it.

611
00:40:07,394 --> 00:40:10,597
Mum, you stop taking that one immediately.
You hear me? Right now.

612
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:16,215
Do what I tell you, I'll explain later.

613
00:40:18,689 --> 00:40:22,915
Mum, you tell Dr. Perlstein that
I won't let you take it.

614
00:40:24,762 --> 00:40:25,753
Good.

615
00:40:27,205 --> 00:40:28,271
Why red?

616
00:40:29,539 --> 00:40:31,181
So who can see you?

617
00:40:32,287 --> 00:40:37,076
Mum, that's rediculous. Mum...

618
00:40:37,077 --> 00:40:39,585
I have to call you back I told you I have company.

619
00:40:39,586 --> 00:40:42,918
OK. I love you. Bye-bye.

620
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:48,355
She got red crutches so she won't hit by a truck.

621
00:40:48,356 --> 00:40:50,585
In case she wanders out on the street at night.

622
00:40:50,586 --> 00:40:52,412
They're giving her Antril for her blood pressure.

623
00:40:52,413 --> 00:40:56,225
If she's taking it and she looks normal,
 I'll take her deposition.

624
00:40:56,226 --> 00:40:58,104
Didn't I have a scarf?

625
00:40:58,105 --> 00:41:00,503
I don't like that attitude of yours.

626
00:41:00,504 --> 00:41:05,030
If my mother has the slightest symptom, my name
will be at the top of a class-action suit.

627
00:41:05,031 --> 00:41:07,431
- We'll have one anyway.
- I should hope so!

628
00:41:07,432 --> 00:41:09,132
Doing the right thing is futile.

629
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:12,705
Honesty is just stupidity. All it does is weaken you.
You let your guard down.

630
00:41:12,738 --> 00:41:16,679
OK, let's go Nancy. That's enough
sermons and lectures for one day.

631
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:21,382
Go ahead, go. But let me tell you this, 
now that I know you two, I'm not surprised

632
00:41:22,149 --> 00:41:25,511
What's his name? Zachary, may have
behaviour issues.

633
00:41:26,474 --> 00:41:28,505
- When you killed that hamster...
- Killed?

634
00:41:28,506 --> 00:41:30,349
- Killed.
- I killed the hamster?

635
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:33,323
Yes. You do everything you can to 
make us feel guilty.

636
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:38,068
You stake out the moral highground as your own,
but you yourself are a murderer.

637
00:41:38,069 --> 00:41:40,412
I definitely did not kill the hamster.

638
00:41:40,413 --> 00:41:43,648
Worse. You left it out there,

639
00:41:43,649 --> 00:41:45,369
Trembling with fear in a hostile environment.

640
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:48,487
That poor critter was probably eaten 
 by a dog or a rat.

641
00:41:48,488 --> 00:41:50,827
- She's right about that.
- What do you mean she is right?

642
00:41:50,828 --> 00:41:54,483
I mean it's horrible, what must have happened
to that animal!

643
00:41:54,484 --> 00:41:58,485
I thought the hamster would be happy to be free.
I was sure he'd go running around in the gutter, happy as a clam!

644
00:41:58,486 --> 00:42:01,086
You just left him there!

645
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:05,310
I can't touch those things, OK? I can't touch
anything of that family.

646
00:42:05,311 --> 00:42:07,328
- Christ, Penny you know that!
- He's afraid of rodents.

647
00:42:07,329 --> 00:42:09,703
Yeah, I have a fear of rodents.

648
00:42:09,704 --> 00:42:13,573
And I have a fear of reptiles. 
Anything down close to the ground, that's it, all right?

649
00:42:13,574 --> 00:42:17,300
What about you? How come you didn't
go downstairs and get it?

650
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:18,766
Because I didn't know!

651
00:42:18,767 --> 00:42:21,462
Michael said this morning the hamster ran away.

652
00:42:21,463 --> 00:42:24,520
So I went right out, I
 went all the way around the block.

653
00:42:24,521 --> 00:42:26,139
I went to the basement!

654
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:31,451
Penelope, it is completely unfair that all of a sudden
I'm in the hot seat about this hamster thing.

655
00:42:31,452 --> 00:42:34,028
That you just had to tell them about.
That's a family issue.

656
00:42:34,029 --> 00:42:37,352
That doesn't concern anybody but us
and it's got nothing to do with this situation here!

657
00:42:37,353 --> 00:42:40,743
And I can't believe I'm getting called
a murderer in my own house!

658
00:42:40,744 --> 00:42:45,029
- What does your house have to do with the price of tea in China?
- My house! I opened the door!

659
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:48,067
The door is wide open in a spirit of reconciliation.

660
00:42:48,068 --> 00:42:50,316
To people who should be a little grateful!

661
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:53,171
Keep right on stroking your own ego,
It's beautiful.

662
00:42:53,172 --> 00:42:56,454
- So you have no remorse?
- I have no remorse.

663
00:42:56,455 --> 00:42:59,052
That animal was disgusting and 
I'm glad it's gone.

664
00:42:59,053 --> 00:43:01,296
- Michael, that's ridiculous.
- What's rediculous?

665
00:43:01,297 --> 00:43:03,830
What, have you lost your mind too?

666
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:06,993
Their son beats the shit out of Ethan and
you're in my face over a hamster?

667
00:43:06,994 --> 00:43:09,140
What you did with that hamster was wrong
and you can't deny that.

668
00:43:09,141 --> 00:43:13,082
- I don't give a shit about the hamster!
- You'll have to give a shit tonight when your daughter get home.

669
00:43:13,083 --> 00:43:17,213
Bring her on! I'm not going to be told how to
act by a 9-year-old snotnose brat!

670
00:43:17,214 --> 00:43:19,706
Now I agree with him there, one hundred percent.

671
00:43:19,708 --> 00:43:24,457
- That's pathetic.
- Watch it, Penelope, watch it.

672
00:43:24,458 --> 00:43:27,545
I've kept my shirt on up till now,
but you're pushing me over a line.

673
00:43:27,546 --> 00:43:29,367
- And Ethan?
- What about Ethan?

674
00:43:29,368 --> 00:43:34,240
- Is he sad too?
- Ethan's got other things on his plate, if you ask me.

675
00:43:34,274 --> 00:43:36,767
- Ethan wasn't so attached to Nibbles.
- Nibbles?

676
00:43:36,768 --> 00:43:39,529
What kind of pussy name is that anyway?

677
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:44,402
If you feel no remorse, why should our son?

678
00:43:44,403 --> 00:43:48,334
You know what? All this consultation and
consideration shit.

679
00:43:48,335 --> 00:43:50,742
I'm sick to death of it. We were nice to you.
We bought tulips.

680
00:43:50,776 --> 00:43:56,400
My wife dressed me up as a liberal,
but the fact is I got no patience for this touchy-feely bullshit.

681
00:43:56,401 --> 00:44:01,001
- And I'm a temperamental son of a bitch.
- We all are.

682
00:44:01,035 --> 00:44:05,601
No, I'm sorry. We are not all
temperamental sons of bitches.

683
00:44:05,602 --> 00:44:07,885
- Not you, of course.
- No, not me! Thank God!

684
00:44:07,886 --> 00:44:10,404
Not you, darjee, not you.

685
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:12,811
You're so evolved. You never go off half-cocked.

686
00:44:12,812 --> 00:44:15,626
- Why are you being so aggressive with me?
- I'm not being aggressive. I'm being honest.

687
00:44:15,661 --> 00:44:17,510
Yes, you are being aggressive!

688
00:44:17,511 --> 00:44:20,710
You put this little bash together
and I let you recruit me...

689
00:44:20,711 --> 00:44:22,449
- You let me recruit you?
- Yes.

690
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:25,139
That's so disgusting.

691
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:28,967
No, it's not. You're an advocate for civilized 
behavior, well that's fine with me.

692
00:44:28,968 --> 00:44:32,892
Yes I'm advocate for civilized behavior, you bet
I am! And it's a good thing somebody is!

693
00:44:32,893 --> 00:44:36,011
You think it's better to be a son of a bitch?

694
00:44:36,046 --> 00:44:38,189
Nobody said that, nobody critisized you that!

695
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:40,043
- You did!
- We did not.

696
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:42,556
What was I supposed to do? 
Was I supposed to sue you?

697
00:44:42,557 --> 00:44:46,679
Never talk to you and tear you to pieces
through the insurance company?

698
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,186
- Stop it, Penny.
- Stop what?!

699
00:44:48,187 --> 00:44:52,118
- You're blowing this all out of proportion.
- I don't care!

700
00:44:52,152 --> 00:44:56,239
You do everything you can to avoid
the pettiness and you wind up

701
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,031
Humiliated and completely alone!

702
00:44:59,032 --> 00:45:00,430
Yes, Walter.

703
00:45:03,086 --> 00:45:05,086
Well, let them prove it.

704
00:45:05,902 --> 00:45:07,202
Prove it!

705
00:45:10,095 --> 00:45:13,022
From where I sit, the best thing for us to do...

706
00:45:13,023 --> 00:45:14,939
We're born alone and we die alone!

707
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,511
Who wants a little Scotch?

708
00:45:18,251 --> 00:45:23,052
Walter, I'm in a meeting right now.
I'll call you when I get back to the office.

709
00:45:23,086 --> 00:45:25,312
That's the thing. I'm living with a 
totally negative person.

710
00:45:25,313 --> 00:45:27,344
- Who's negative?
- Me.

711
00:45:28,448 --> 00:45:31,169
This was the worst possible idea!
We should never have had this meeting.

712
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:33,071
- I told you so.
- You told me so?

713
00:45:33,072 --> 00:45:34,121
Yeah!

714
00:45:34,122 --> 00:45:37,288
- You told me we should never have this meeting?
- I didn't think it was a very good idea.

715
00:45:37,289 --> 00:45:40,256
- It was a good idea.
- Oh come on. Who wants a little?

716
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:42,724
You told me you think it wasn't a good idea?

717
00:45:42,725 --> 00:45:44,751
- As I recall.
- As you recall!

718
00:45:44,752 --> 00:45:47,520
- Maybe just a little slip.
- Don't you have to go?

719
00:45:47,521 --> 00:45:50,864
At this point in the game, 
I may as well have a little drink.

720
00:45:52,314 --> 00:45:55,032
You tell me again we didn't
both agree on this!

721
00:45:55,033 --> 00:45:57,873
Calm down, Penelope, this is going nowhere.

722
00:45:57,874 --> 00:46:00,707
Who said not to touch the cobbler this morning?

723
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:03,234
Who said we should keep the rest for the
Cowan's? Who said that?!

724
00:46:03,235 --> 00:46:05,147
That was very nice of you.

725
00:46:05,148 --> 00:46:08,805
- What's that to do with anything?
- What do you mean what's that to do with anything?

726
00:46:08,806 --> 00:46:12,149
- Guests are guests.
- You're lying, you're lying!

727
00:46:13,241 --> 00:46:16,851
You know, my wife actually had to
drag me here today.

728
00:46:16,852 --> 00:46:19,643
When you grow up with a certain 
John Wayne idea of manhood,

729
00:46:19,644 --> 00:46:23,322
The impulse in this kind of situation
is not to talk it through.

730
00:46:23,323 --> 00:46:28,065
- I thought the role model was Ivanhoe.
- Same basic concept.

731
00:46:28,068 --> 00:46:31,178
- Another aspect.
- Another aspect!

732
00:46:31,179 --> 00:46:33,636
Just how much are you going to
humiliate yourself?

733
00:46:33,637 --> 00:46:36,173
I can see I dragged hiim here for nothing.

734
00:46:36,208 --> 00:46:40,028
- What did you expect, Doodle?
- That is a ridiculous nickname.

735
00:46:40,029 --> 00:46:44,407
Some revelation about universal values?
This scotch is unbelievable.

736
00:46:45,308 --> 00:46:50,167
See that? 18 years old, single malt, from a tiny
place in Scotland where they still grow their own barley.

737
00:46:50,168 --> 00:46:52,782
What about the tulips? Who got them?

738
00:46:52,783 --> 00:46:56,857
All I said was it's too bad we didn't get any tulips.

739
00:46:56,858 --> 00:46:58,986
I never said anything about going all
the way up to Henry street at dawn.

740
00:46:58,987 --> 00:47:02,688
Don't get all bent out of shape over this,
Penelope, It's not worth it.

741
00:47:02,689 --> 00:47:05,167
He got the tulips! Him and only him!

742
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:09,381
Don't we get a drink?

743
00:47:10,707 --> 00:47:13,218
Penelope and I would like a drink too.

744
00:47:24,265 --> 00:47:27,291
Pretty funny when you think about it.

745
00:47:28,087 --> 00:47:32,541
A devotee of Ivanhoe and John Wayne
but he's scared to pick up an itty-bitty mouse.

746
00:47:32,542 --> 00:47:37,166
- Stop the hamster. Stop.
- She's right, it's laughable.

747
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,821
- And her?
- I don't think that will be necessary.

748
00:47:39,822 --> 00:47:41,872
- Pour me a drink, Michael.
- No.

749
00:47:41,873 --> 00:47:43,258
- Michael!
- No.

750
00:47:43,259 --> 00:47:45,212
What is wrong with you, Michael?

751
00:47:49,047 --> 00:47:52,275
Fine, fine. Drink, What does it matter?

752
00:47:53,214 --> 00:47:56,658
- Is drinking bad for you or something?
- No, no, it's great for me.

753
00:48:01,959 --> 00:48:03,216
Now I don't know...

754
00:48:07,793 --> 00:48:09,938
- Mr. Cowan...
- Alan.

755
00:48:10,872 --> 00:48:11,896
Alan...

756
00:48:12,555 --> 00:48:15,974
See, you and I didn't exactly hit it off

757
00:48:15,975 --> 00:48:22,286
I live with a man who has decided once and for
all that life is synonymous with mediocrity.

758
00:48:22,962 --> 00:48:27,477
It's very hard to live with a man who's walled
himself up in that idea,

759
00:48:27,478 --> 00:48:30,722
who doesn't want to change anything,
who never gets excited about anything...

760
00:48:30,723 --> 00:48:34,160
What are you telling this for?
He could care less.

761
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:39,452
You have to believe, you have to believe 
some possible correction.

762
00:48:39,453 --> 00:48:42,120
He's the last guy on earth you
should be telling this to.

763
00:48:42,121 --> 00:48:44,441
I'll talk to anyone I damn well please!

764
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:47,981
Who the fuck is that now?

765
00:48:49,673 --> 00:48:50,485
Mother

766
00:48:54,496 --> 00:48:55,880
Hi, Ma.

767
00:48:58,476 --> 00:49:01,577
He's fine. He got his teeth knocked out
but he's fine.

768
00:49:02,562 --> 00:49:05,313
He's in pain, it hurts, it'll pass.

769
00:49:05,314 --> 00:49:08,259
Ma, I told you I have company.
I'll call you back, remember?

770
00:49:09,629 --> 00:49:10,733
Yeah, bye.

771
00:49:10,734 --> 00:49:13,272
- He's still in pain?
- No.

772
00:49:13,942 --> 00:49:17,977
- Then why do you worry your mother?
- He has to worry, he can't help himself.

773
00:49:17,978 --> 00:49:21,479
Ok, Penelope, that's enough. 
What is this drama queen bullshit?

774
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:25,262
Penelope, nobody cares about anything
outside himself.

775
00:49:25,263 --> 00:49:29,295
Sure, we'd all like to believe in 
some kind of possible correction,

776
00:49:29,528 --> 00:49:33,619
One we could author ourselves,
completely free of selfish consideration.

777
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:36,469
Like you're writing this book about Darfur...

778
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:38,490
Which is great!

779
00:49:38,491 --> 00:49:42,885
I understand how you might say,
OK, I'll pick a massacre,

780
00:49:42,886 --> 00:49:44,442
History is full of them, and I'm going to write a book.

781
00:49:44,443 --> 00:49:46,612
Everybody has to save himself somehow.

782
00:49:46,613 --> 00:49:48,893
I'm not writing this book to save myself.

783
00:49:48,894 --> 00:49:51,339
You haven't read it, you don't even 
know what's in it!

784
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:53,263
Whatever.

785
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:57,566
The smell of Kronos is killing me.

786
00:49:57,567 --> 00:50:00,313
- It fucking reeks!
- You didn't exactly skimp.

787
00:50:00,314 --> 00:50:04,077
- I'm so sorry.
- It's my fault. I sprayed like a madwoman.

788
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:09,950
Why can't things be easier?

789
00:50:09,951 --> 00:50:14,711
Why does everything have to be so exhausting?

790
00:50:14,712 --> 00:50:17,944
You think too much. Women think too much.

791
00:50:17,945 --> 00:50:19,716
There's an original response?

792
00:50:19,717 --> 00:50:21,434
I don't know what that means, to think too much.

793
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:26,918
And I don't understand how you can go
on living without some moral sense of the world.

794
00:50:26,919 --> 00:50:28,483
Look at me, I'm living!

795
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:29,962
Michael, shut up.

796
00:50:30,746 --> 00:50:33,586
Miserable complicity! Just disgusting.

797
00:50:33,587 --> 00:50:37,329
- What happened to your sense of humor?
- I don't have a sense of humor, and I don't want one.

798
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:41,984
If you ask me, the couple is the most terrible
ordeal God ever inflicted on us.

799
00:50:41,985 --> 00:50:43,255
Ah, marvelous.

800
00:50:43,256 --> 00:50:47,387
- The couple and the family.
- No one is forcing you to air this out in front of us, Michael.

801
00:50:47,388 --> 00:50:49,789
And I might add, it's a little indecent.

802
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:52,408
- That doesn't bother him.
- You agree with me, don't you?

803
00:50:52,409 --> 00:50:56,123
Look, this is all, beside the point.

804
00:50:56,874 --> 00:51:01,105
- Alan, say something.
- He has a right to his ideas.

805
00:51:01,106 --> 00:51:03,877
- That doesn't mean he has to advertise them.
- Yeah, maybe.

806
00:51:04,876 --> 00:51:06,613
We don't care about their marriage.

807
00:51:06,648 --> 00:51:09,518
We're here about a problem with the kids.
We don't care about their marriage.

808
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:10,812
- Yes, except...
- Except what?

809
00:51:10,813 --> 00:51:14,669
- It's related.
- Of course it's related.

810
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:17,033
Ethan's getting two of his teeth broken
is related to our marriage?

811
00:51:17,034 --> 00:51:19,435
- Of course it is.
- Sorry I don't follow you.

812
00:51:19,436 --> 00:51:22,620
Take a step back and look at the situation we're in.

813
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:27,826
Chrldren suck the life out of you and leave us
old and empty. It's the law of nature.

814
00:51:27,827 --> 00:51:31,193
You see these young couples, 
laughing all the way to the alter.

815
00:51:31,194 --> 00:51:34,342
You think they don't know.
Poor fuckers have no idea.

816
00:51:34,343 --> 00:51:37,213
They're happy. Nobody tells y
ou this stuff in the beginning.

817
00:51:37,214 --> 00:51:40,906
I get this army buddy of mine is going
to have a kid with his new girlfriend.

818
00:51:40,907 --> 00:51:44,985
I say to him, "A kid at our age?
what are you stupid?"

819
00:51:44,986 --> 00:51:49,071
"You got ten, fifteen good years left before
you get cancer or have a stroke,"

820
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:51,791
"and you're gonna saddle yourself
with a fucking kid?"

821
00:51:51,792 --> 00:51:54,154
- That's not really what you think.
- Yes it is.

822
00:51:54,155 --> 00:51:58,076
- Of course it's what I think, even worse.
- Yeah, you're debasing yourself, Michael.

823
00:51:58,077 --> 00:52:00,161
Is that right?

824
00:52:00,162 --> 00:52:03,838
Stop crying, Penelope. Makes it worse.

825
00:52:06,145 --> 00:52:07,754
Of course, of course.

826
00:52:08,735 --> 00:52:10,888
- Excellent, isn't it?
- So excellent.

827
00:52:10,889 --> 00:52:14,907
- Could I interest you in a cigar?
- No cigars in the house!

828
00:52:14,908 --> 00:52:17,374
- Too bad.
- Were you going to smoke a cigar now, Alan?

829
00:52:17,375 --> 00:52:21,203
I do what I want, Nancy. If I want
to smoke a cigar, I smoke a cigar.

830
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:23,836
I won't smoke it because I don't 
want to upset Penelope,

831
00:52:23,837 --> 00:52:27,224
Who's already on edge, to put it mildly.

832
00:52:27,225 --> 00:52:31,005
Oh, quit snuffling like that, she's right.

833
00:52:31,006 --> 00:52:34,898
When women cry, men are pushing 
to their breaking point.

834
00:52:34,899 --> 00:52:40,476
Although unfortunately, I must say that Michael's
point of view is completely justified.

835
00:52:40,477 --> 00:52:41,510
Yeah.

836
00:52:42,472 --> 00:52:43,985
Yeah, sure, go ahead.

837
00:52:45,712 --> 00:52:48,276
Put "New York" and a specific time of day.

838
00:52:48,277 --> 00:52:50,108
It's unbearable!

839
00:52:50,929 --> 00:52:53,736
The time you send it. It has to be
hot off the press.

840
00:52:55,285 --> 00:52:58,542
No, not "questions". "Deplores".
Questions is wishy-washy.

841
00:52:58,543 --> 00:53:01,421
I live with this night and day.

842
00:53:01,422 --> 00:53:04,111
- One second.
- Our lives are chopped up by the cell phone.

843
00:53:04,112 --> 00:53:07,246
- Nancy, this is very important.
- It's always very important.

844
00:53:08,271 --> 00:53:11,320
What's happening somewhere
else is always more important.

845
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:17,527
Not "strategy". "Scheme". A scheme surfacing
two weeks from the company's posting.

846
00:53:18,404 --> 00:53:22,939
In the street. At the dinner table. Everywhere.

847
00:53:23,906 --> 00:53:28,368
"A study" in quotes. Put the word
"study" in quotes.

848
00:53:28,369 --> 00:53:32,802
I don't even protest anymore.
Unconditional surrender.

849
00:53:33,848 --> 00:53:36,718
- I feel like I'm going to vomit again.
- Where's that bucket?

850
00:53:36,719 --> 00:53:39,065
How am I supposed to know?

851
00:53:43,827 --> 00:53:46,190
Then just quote me.

852
00:53:46,191 --> 00:53:49,412
- Can you stand over the bucket please?
- Pen!

853
00:53:49,413 --> 00:53:53,017
It's all right. We're set up to handle this now.

854
00:53:53,018 --> 00:53:57,262
...according to TW Pharma attorney
Alan Cowan.

855
00:53:59,182 --> 00:54:04,153
AP, Reuters, major newspapers,
trade journals, the whole shebang.

856
00:54:07,158 --> 00:54:09,305
-What's wrong?
- She's gonna throw up again.

857
00:54:09,306 --> 00:54:12,186
- You're so caring, it's touching.
- I'm worried.

858
00:54:12,187 --> 00:54:14,243
I didn't get that, my mistake.

859
00:54:14,244 --> 00:54:18,442
Oh come on Nancy, will you?
You and I don't have to do this.

860
00:54:18,443 --> 00:54:21,788
Their marriage is going downhill, we don't
have to try to compete with them.

861
00:54:21,789 --> 00:54:24,231
What gives you the right to say our marriage
is going downhill?

862
00:54:24,232 --> 00:54:25,639
What gives you the right?

863
00:54:28,147 --> 00:54:29,516
Yeah, Walter.

864
00:54:29,551 --> 00:54:34,014
Yeah, I just had it read back.
They're sending it over to you.

865
00:54:35,757 --> 00:54:38,287
Manipulation. Manipulation of the stock price.

866
00:54:38,288 --> 00:54:41,013
Walter, I'll call you back in a minute.

867
00:54:41,014 --> 00:54:43,580
- I didn't say it. Steven did.
- Michael.

868
00:54:45,378 --> 00:54:49,859
- I won't let you judge our family.
- Then don't judge our son either.

869
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:52,535
That's different! Your son brutalized our son!

870
00:54:52,536 --> 00:54:56,929
They're young, they're kids, 
kids roughhouse in the playground.

871
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:59,322
Always have always will, it's a rule of nature.

872
00:54:59,323 --> 00:55:01,009
- No it isn't!
- Sure it is.

873
00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:04,918
It takes a little education to substitute
the rule of law for violence.

874
00:55:04,919 --> 00:55:08,857
The origin of law, of course you know,
is brute force.

875
00:55:08,858 --> 00:55:11,466
Maybe for cavemen, not in this world.

876
00:55:11,467 --> 00:55:16,056
- Tell me about this world!
- Boring! This conversation is boring.

877
00:55:16,057 --> 00:55:19,856
Penelope, I believe in the god of carnage.

878
00:55:19,857 --> 00:55:22,875
The god whose rule has been
unchallenged since time immemorial.

879
00:55:22,876 --> 00:55:25,145
You're interested in Africa, right?

880
00:55:26,274 --> 00:55:28,538
- What's the matter?
- Don't worry about me.

881
00:55:28,539 --> 00:55:30,532
- Nancy!
- I'm just fine.

882
00:55:32,709 --> 00:55:37,491
See, I just got back from the Congo. They got
kids there, trained to kill at the age of eight.

883
00:55:37,492 --> 00:55:40,309
In the course of their childhood, they might 
kill hundreds of people.

884
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:45,069
They'll kill with a machete, a shotgun,
a Kalash, a thumper.

885
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:49,230
So obviously when my kid busts some other
kid's tooth, even two teeth,

886
00:55:49,231 --> 00:55:52,089
with a bamboo switch by the sandbox,

887
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:54,716
I'm not quite as shocked and indignant as you are.

888
00:55:54,717 --> 00:55:57,145
- Well you should be.
- Thumper.

889
00:55:57,146 --> 00:56:00,595
- Yes, that's why they call a grenade launcher.
- That's what I call it.

890
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:03,399
- You all right?
- Just fine.

891
00:56:05,147 --> 00:56:08,978
- What's wrong with her?
- It's bile, nothing.

892
00:56:08,979 --> 00:56:14,027
Don't you tell me about Africa! I know
all about suffering in Africa.

893
00:56:14,028 --> 00:56:15,418
I don't doubt it.

894
00:56:15,419 --> 00:56:17,368
That's all I've been thinking about for months!

895
00:56:17,369 --> 00:56:20,442
Don't get her started on this, please!

896
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:25,672
- You know I'm actually starting to like you.
- Shut up!

897
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:29,871
- Talk about commitment to world peace and stability.
- Shut the fuck up, Michael!

898
00:56:29,872 --> 00:56:34,880
- You sure about that?
- Very sure. Do me some good.

899
00:56:34,881 --> 00:56:40,300
We live in New York. We don't live in Kinshasa!
We live in New York City!

900
00:56:41,145 --> 00:56:44,116
With the customs of western society.

901
00:56:44,117 --> 00:56:48,630
What happens in a Brooklyn playground is 
about western values!

902
00:56:48,631 --> 00:56:53,414
To which, like it or not, I happen to subscribe.

903
00:56:53,415 --> 00:56:56,316
Beating your husband must be one of
those customs then...

904
00:56:56,317 --> 00:57:00,852
- I'm warning you, Michael!
- She was all over you like a bad rash!

905
00:57:00,853 --> 00:57:06,094
- If I were you it would melt my heart.
- He's making fun of you, do you believe it?

906
00:57:06,129 --> 00:57:07,537
I don't care about this...

907
00:57:07,538 --> 00:57:13,158
No, really. Morally, we're supposed to overcome
our impulses but there are times you don't want to overcome them.

908
00:57:14,118 --> 00:57:17,406
I mean, who wants to say a 
"Hail Mary" when having sex?

909
00:57:17,407 --> 00:57:21,151
- Can you buy this scotch around here?
- No, this very likely no.

910
00:57:22,265 --> 00:57:23,739
Thumper!

911
00:57:24,766 --> 00:57:27,327
- Thumper, really.
- Yeah. Thumper.

912
00:57:27,328 --> 00:57:28,333
So it is called.

913
00:57:29,967 --> 00:57:33,416
- Why don't you just say grenade launcher?
- Because it's a term.

914
00:57:33,417 --> 00:57:37,086
Just like they say "kalash" and not
Kalashnikov or AK-47.

915
00:57:37,087 --> 00:57:40,016
- Who is they?
- That's enough, Nancy, that's enough.

916
00:57:39,817 --> 00:57:44,410
Hotshot firebrands like my husband,
you got to understand,

917
00:57:44,644 --> 00:57:47,726
It's hard for them to get excited 
about what happens down the block.

918
00:57:47,727 --> 00:57:48,935
Exactly.

919
00:57:48,936 --> 00:57:53,011
I don't see why. I don't see why.

920
00:57:53,012 --> 00:57:58,076
We're all citizens of the world. I don't see
why we shouldn't have some sense of community.

921
00:57:58,077 --> 00:58:02,803
Penelope, enough for the highfalutin clap trap!

922
00:58:02,804 --> 00:58:04,892
I'm gonna kill him.

923
00:58:04,893 --> 00:58:06,287
Yeah.

924
00:58:10,243 --> 00:58:13,361
She's right! It's unbearable after a while.

925
00:58:13,362 --> 00:58:16,800
"Brazen". a brazen attempt to...
There you go.

926
00:58:16,801 --> 00:58:19,502
He sighed off the rest?

927
00:58:20,555 --> 00:58:22,075
Sure.

928
00:58:23,072 --> 00:58:25,708
What were we talking about? Thumpers?

929
00:58:25,709 --> 00:58:30,295
We were saying that, dispite my husband thinks,

930
00:58:30,296 --> 00:58:36,479
Whether it happens here or other parts of the world,
we must be collectively concerned.

931
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:43,776
"Collectively concerned". Nancy, it's
absurd to drink in your condition.

932
00:58:43,777 --> 00:58:46,638
What condition? I'm perfect.

933
00:58:46,639 --> 00:58:50,840
That's interesting... Yeah?

934
00:58:52,466 --> 00:58:55,408
No, no interviews before we get this release out.

935
00:58:55,409 --> 00:59:00,858
Mr. Cowan, would you please put an end to
this nerve-racking conversation?

936
00:59:00,859 --> 00:59:05,618
No way. The stockholders won't give a shit.
The stockholders...

937
00:59:05,619 --> 00:59:08,894
Nancy what are you...
Are you out of your fucking mind?

938
00:59:10,263 --> 00:59:12,763
- There.
- Shit!

939
00:59:13,849 --> 00:59:15,788
- Oh my god.
- Way to go!

940
00:59:24,051 --> 00:59:27,433
- The blow-dryer!
- What is wrong with you?

941
00:59:29,237 --> 00:59:34,184
I can't believe this! I got everything in there.
It's brand new, I spent hours setting it up!

942
00:59:34,219 --> 00:59:39,131
I can't believe you did that.
That was an irresponsible thing to do.

943
00:59:41,099 --> 00:59:43,271
My whole life was in there!

944
00:59:43,272 --> 00:59:45,804
His whole life...

945
00:59:48,902 --> 00:59:51,618
Take out the battery and SIM card.
How to do that?

946
00:59:53,591 --> 00:59:55,530
I just got it, I don't know!

947
00:59:58,246 --> 01:00:02,416
They thikn it's funny, they think it's funny!

948
01:00:05,679 --> 01:00:08,098
Penelope, it's not funny!

949
01:00:08,099 --> 01:00:12,566
My husband has spent the entire
afternoot drying thing!

950
01:00:20,521 --> 01:00:24,024
- Forget it. It's over.
- You gotta wait.

951
01:00:27,894 --> 01:00:30,565
You want to use the phone?

952
01:00:33,548 --> 01:00:35,527
I must say...

953
01:00:36,264 --> 01:00:39,868
What...What must you say, Michael?

954
01:00:40,668 --> 01:00:43,513
No, I don't even know what to say.

955
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:50,934
I'd say it feels better like this, wouldn't you?

956
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:55,472
Men get so attached to their toys.

957
01:00:55,507 --> 01:00:59,211
It diminishes them.
They lose their credibility.

958
01:01:00,388 --> 01:01:07,107
I liked this guy once and then I saw him carrying
this rectangular bag. But with a shoulder strap.

959
01:01:07,108 --> 01:01:11,843
A man's bag, but with a shoulder strap!
It was over!

960
01:01:11,844 --> 01:01:15,144
A bag with a shoulder strap, that's the worst.

961
01:01:15,145 --> 01:01:19,432
But the cell phone always at his
fingertips is the worst, too.

962
01:01:20,223 --> 01:01:25,273
A man should have both hands free.

963
01:01:25,326 --> 01:01:28,827
I've got a John Wayne idea of manhood, too.

964
01:01:28,923 --> 01:01:32,717
What was it he had? A Colt '45.
Something that empties a room...

965
01:01:32,718 --> 01:01:38,604
Any man that doesn't give off those loner vibes
just doesn't come off as having any substance...

966
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:43,906
So Michael, I guess you are happy now.

967
01:01:43,907 --> 01:01:48,249
Our touchy-feely-whatever you said-
is coming apart at the seams.

968
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:53,411
But you know what?
This almost feels good. In my opinion.

969
01:01:53,445 --> 01:01:57,566
Yeah, well in my opinion, some people can hold
their liquor better than others.

970
01:01:57,567 --> 01:02:00,583
- I'm as normal as I can be.
- Yeah, right.

971
01:02:00,584 --> 01:02:04,904
I'm beginning to see things
with a pleasant serenity.

972
01:02:04,905 --> 01:02:08,129
That's good! "A pleasant serenity"!

973
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:11,450
I can't understand why you're wasting yourself,
right out in the open, darjeeling.

974
01:02:11,451 --> 01:02:15,255
- Shut the hell up.
- Alan, relax.

975
01:02:15,256 --> 01:02:18,558
- No cigars in the house!
- Hoyo de Monterrey.

976
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:23,205
Partagas D number4, you got
your Hoyo Coronation.

977
01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:25,810
- Where did you get these?
- You don't want to know.

978
01:02:25,811 --> 01:02:28,374
- Seriously.
- The Spanish connection.

979
01:02:28,375 --> 01:02:33,253
My cookware guy. His best friend is going with a flight
attendant. Brings in like two boxes a week.

980
01:02:33,254 --> 01:02:37,115
You can't smoke in a house with an asthmatic child!

981
01:02:37,116 --> 01:02:39,369
And why are you telling him your whole life story?

982
01:02:39,370 --> 01:02:41,270
- Who has asthma?
- Our son.

983
01:02:41,271 --> 01:02:45,844
- We had a goddamn hamster, didn't we?
- It's true that pets aren't good when you're asthmatic.

984
01:02:47,021 --> 01:02:50,934
- Not good at all!
- Even goldfish aren't necessarily recommended.

985
01:02:50,935 --> 01:02:53,434
Do I have to listen to this crap?

986
01:02:53,435 --> 01:02:57,780
I guess I'm the only one who
doesn't see things with pleasant serendity.

987
01:02:58,576 --> 01:03:02,177
The truth is, I've never been so unhappy.

988
01:03:02,178 --> 01:03:04,324
Unhappiest day of my life.

989
01:03:04,325 --> 01:03:06,399
You're an unhappy drunk.

990
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:11,815
Michael, every word out of your mouth just slays me.

991
01:03:11,816 --> 01:03:15,203
I don't get drunk.

992
01:03:15,204 --> 01:03:21,254
I had a sip of your shitty 18-year old single malt...
that you trot out like it's the 18 wonder of the world.

993
01:03:21,255 --> 01:03:25,438
I don't get drunk, and believe me I wish I could.

994
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:30,463
It would be such a relief to drown every
little sorrow in a good stiff drink.

995
01:03:32,578 --> 01:03:35,004
My husband is unhappy, too.

996
01:03:36,113 --> 01:03:39,783
Look at him. All hunched over.
Like he was left on the side of the road.

997
01:03:39,784 --> 01:03:43,735
I think this is the unhappiest day 
of his life, too.

998
01:03:43,736 --> 01:03:46,306
- It is!
- I'm sorry, Doodle.

999
01:03:56,978 --> 01:03:59,243
Hello?

1000
01:04:00,061 --> 01:04:01,288
Hello?

1001
01:04:02,066 --> 01:04:05,425
Mum! I told you I have company, remember?

1002
01:04:08,869 --> 01:04:11,982
Because it's medication thant can 
kill you! It's poison!

1003
01:04:12,784 --> 01:04:16,420
Mum, someone here who can explain.

1004
01:04:17,136 --> 01:04:19,530
- Here! Tell her!
- Tell her what?

1005
01:04:19,531 --> 01:04:22,222
Tell her what you know about that
poison shit of yours.

1006
01:04:23,453 --> 01:04:26,444
What can he tell her?
He doesn't know anything.

1007
01:04:28,581 --> 01:04:31,049
Hello, ma'am, how are you?

1008
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:35,866
No...

1009
01:04:37,329 --> 01:04:39,313
Are you in pain?

1010
01:04:41,016 --> 01:04:44,436
Yeah...the operation will fix that.

1011
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:49,577
The other leg too, huh?

1012
01:04:50,279 --> 01:04:54,545
No, I'm not an orthopedist.
She keeps calling me doctor.

1013
01:04:54,546 --> 01:04:58,978
Doctor, what a laugh! Hang up!

1014
01:04:59,011 --> 01:05:00,395
Yeah!

1015
01:05:02,237 --> 01:05:04,546
Do you have any balance issues?

1016
01:05:07,849 --> 01:05:12,210
No, of course not, not at all.
It can't kill you.

1017
01:05:12,244 --> 01:05:14,692
Don't listen to what people say.

1018
01:05:14,693 --> 01:05:18,248
It's probably a good idea not 
to take it for a while.

1019
01:05:19,144 --> 01:05:21,848
Just until this operation is behind you.

1020
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:29,325
Yes, sounds like you're in excellent shape.

1021
01:05:29,326 --> 01:05:33,320
You got that Ma? You stop
taking that medication!

1022
01:05:34,104 --> 01:05:37,539
Do as a told, all right? I love you.

1023
01:05:40,410 --> 01:05:42,753
I can't take her anymore.

1024
01:05:42,754 --> 01:05:46,454
- The shit I put up with.
- All right, should we wrap this up?

1025
01:05:46,487 --> 01:05:49,931
Should I come back tonight with Zachary?
Let's decide.

1026
01:05:49,932 --> 01:05:54,582
This is getting to be like, who cares?
That is what we're here for, after all.

1027
01:05:54,583 --> 01:05:57,596
Now I'm going to be sick. 
Where's that bucket?

1028
01:06:00,166 --> 01:06:02,748
That's enough!

1029
01:06:02,749 --> 01:06:06,285
I'd say both sides share the blame.

1030
01:06:08,699 --> 01:06:11,346
There you are, both sides share the blame.

1031
01:06:11,347 --> 01:06:14,453
- Are you serious?
- Excuse me?

1032
01:06:14,488 --> 01:06:18,968
- That's what you really think?
- It's what I think, yes.

1033
01:06:19,003 --> 01:06:23,424
My son Ethan, who took codeine last night
at three in the morning, he shares the blame?

1034
01:06:23,425 --> 01:06:26,338
He's not necessarily innocent.

1035
01:06:26,339 --> 01:06:30,373
Get out my house. Get the fuck out of my house!

1036
01:06:32,034 --> 01:06:33,595
My bag!

1037
01:06:34,675 --> 01:06:37,434
What is going on here?
They're totally lost it.

1038
01:06:37,435 --> 01:06:41,320
- Alan, do something!
- "Alan, do something"~~

1039
01:06:41,321 --> 01:06:46,946
Shut your mouth! She broke my make-up
mirror and my perfume!

1040
01:06:46,947 --> 01:06:51,513
Stand up for me. Why don't you stand up for me?

1041
01:06:52,826 --> 01:06:55,923
- Let's go, Nancy.
- It's not like I'm strangling her!

1042
01:06:55,924 --> 01:06:59,578
- What did I do to you?
- The blame is not shared!

1043
01:06:59,579 --> 01:07:03,327
The victim and the criminal are not the same!

1044
01:07:03,328 --> 01:07:06,402
- The criminal?!
- Oh give it a fucking rest, Penelope!

1045
01:07:06,403 --> 01:07:09,229
Enough of these idealistic theories shit!

1046
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:12,389
- Which I believe in.
- You believe, you believe!

1047
01:07:12,390 --> 01:07:17,285
This crush you got on these Sudan sambos is
spilling over into everything now!

1048
01:07:17,286 --> 01:07:21,697
I am horrified. How can you be so
openly despicable?

1049
01:07:21,698 --> 01:07:25,745
Because I feel like it.
I feel like being openly despicable.

1050
01:07:25,746 --> 01:07:29,966
One day you'll understand the sheer horror
of what's happening in that part of the world,

1051
01:07:29,967 --> 01:07:34,997
And you'll be ashamed of you inability to take
action, of your contemptibly nihilistic attitude.

1052
01:07:34,998 --> 01:07:39,183
Yes, darjeeling, you're so wonderful!

1053
01:07:39,184 --> 01:07:43,688
- You're the best and the brightest!
- Yes I am! Yes I am!

1054
01:07:43,689 --> 01:07:48,090
Let's get out of here Alan.
These people are monsters.

1055
01:07:48,853 --> 01:07:53,273
- Stop it, Nancy.
- No, no. I want to drink some more.

1056
01:07:53,274 --> 01:07:55,890
I want to get drunk off my ass.

1057
01:07:55,891 --> 01:08:00,030
This bitch throws my bag against a wall
and nobody lifts a finger.

1058
01:08:00,031 --> 01:08:02,865
- I want to be blink drunk!
- You're drunk enough.

1059
01:08:02,866 --> 01:08:05,923
How can you let her call our son a criminal?

1060
01:08:05,924 --> 01:08:08,935
We came over here to work things out...

1061
01:08:08,936 --> 01:08:14,687
They insult us, browbeat us, they lecture us
about being good citizens of the planet.

1062
01:08:14,688 --> 01:08:18,911
I'm glad our son kicked the shit out of your son,

1063
01:08:18,946 --> 01:08:22,862
And I wipe my ass with your human rights!

1064
01:08:24,316 --> 01:08:28,856
A little booze and bang!
Her true self comes out.

1065
01:08:28,857 --> 01:08:32,484
What happened to that gracious,
demure woman with the soft eyes...

1066
01:08:32,485 --> 01:08:35,414
- I told you, I told you!
- What did you tell him?

1067
01:08:35,415 --> 01:08:39,237
That she was fake. This women is totally fake.
I'm sorry.

1068
01:08:39,238 --> 01:08:42,038
- When exactly did you say that?
- When you were drying your pants!

1069
01:08:42,039 --> 01:08:45,344
You had known her 15 minutes and 
you already knew she was a fake?

1070
01:08:45,345 --> 01:08:48,856
- I pick up on these things in people very quickly.
- She does.

1071
01:08:48,857 --> 01:08:51,005
- I just have a nose for it.
- Fake, what does that mean?

1072
01:08:51,006 --> 01:08:55,979
I don't want to listen to this.
Why do you put me through this, Alan?

1073
01:08:55,980 --> 01:08:57,515
Relax, Nancy...

1074
01:08:57,516 --> 01:09:00,646
She's a complete phony.
She doesn't care any more than you do.

1075
01:09:00,647 --> 01:09:02,516
It's true.

1076
01:09:02,517 --> 01:09:05,528
- He said it's true.
- They don't give a shit!

1077
01:09:05,529 --> 01:09:09,257
It's obvious from the beginning,
they don't give a shit.

1078
01:09:09,258 --> 01:09:12,870
- She doesn't give a shit either.
- Like you do?

1079
01:09:12,871 --> 01:09:18,018
Let him talk, honey. Explain to me, Michael,
exactly how you care.

1080
01:09:18,019 --> 01:09:22,293
What does that mean anyway? You're more
credible when you're being openly despicable.

1081
01:09:22,294 --> 01:09:25,497
Truth is, nobody here cares.
Except maybe Penelope.

1082
01:09:25,498 --> 01:09:27,630
One must acknowledge her integrity.

1083
01:09:27,631 --> 01:09:31,582
I don't need your acknowledgment!
I don't need your acknowledgment!

1084
01:09:31,583 --> 01:09:34,402
But I do care. I really do care.

1085
01:09:34,403 --> 01:09:37,691
Yes Doodle we care in a hysterical way,

1086
01:09:37,692 --> 01:09:41,299
Not like heroic figures of a social movement.

1087
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:44,723
I saw your friend Jane Fonda 
on TV the other day.

1088
01:09:44,724 --> 01:09:48,950
Made me want to run out and buy
a Ku Klux Klan poster.

1089
01:09:48,951 --> 01:09:53,713
My friend Jane Fonda?
What the hell does that mean?

1090
01:09:53,714 --> 01:09:58,421
You're the same breed. You're the same kind
of involved, problem-solver woman.

1091
01:09:58,422 --> 01:10:01,699
Those are not the women we like.

1092
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:05,034
The women we like are sensual,
crazy, shot full of hormones.

1093
01:10:05,035 --> 01:10:08,746
The gatekeepers of the world, the ones
who want to show off how perceptive they are,

1094
01:10:08,747 --> 01:10:11,272
Huge turnoff.

1095
01:10:11,273 --> 01:10:15,223
Even poor Michael, your own husband is turned off...

1096
01:10:15,224 --> 01:10:16,759
Don't you speak for me.

1097
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:19,988
We don't give a shit about what women you like!

1098
01:10:19,989 --> 01:10:22,410
Where do you get off spouting these opinions?

1099
01:10:22,411 --> 01:10:25,881
You're one man whose opinions we
don't give a shit about!

1100
01:10:25,882 --> 01:10:27,980
She is screaming.

1101
01:10:27,981 --> 01:10:31,141
A quartermaster on a slave ship.

1102
01:10:31,142 --> 01:10:37,533
What about her? She doesn't scream? She didn't just
scream that your little asshole was right to beat up ours?

1103
01:10:37,534 --> 01:10:40,165
He was right!

1104
01:10:40,166 --> 01:10:42,799
At least our kid isn't a little wimpy-ass faggot!

1105
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:46,502
Yours is a fucking snitch!

1106
01:10:46,631 --> 01:10:52,320
Let's go Alan, why are we still in this house?

1107
01:10:54,596 --> 01:11:00,130
Here, this is what I think of these stupid tulips!

1108
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:02,448
Your hideous flowers!

1109
01:11:04,662 --> 01:11:07,783
Worst day of my life, too.

1110
01:11:47,795 --> 01:11:51,635
- THE END -
