January 11th, at 2:30 PM.
2
You'll do your statement separately, this is ours.
3
...following a verbal dispute in Brooklyn Bridge Park...
4
Zachary Cowan, age 11, and armed with a stick
5
struck our son, Ethan Longstreet, in the face.
6
In addition ot the swelling and bruising of Ethan's upper lip
7
this act also resulted in two broken incisors
8
including nerve damage to the right incisor
9
- "Armed"?
10
Armed. You don't like armed?
11
Michael, what could we say? Carrying? Holding? Carring a stick?
12
- "Carrying", yeah. - "Carrying a stick".
13
- "Carrying"...
14
It's ironic, we always thought the Brooklyn Bridge Park was so safe compared to Hillside.
15
- Ture. We always said, Brooklyn Bridge Park, fine. Hillside, no way.
16
Just goes to show you.
17
Hey, thank you so much for coming!
18
It's so much better than getting caught up in that adversarial mindset.
19
- Well we thank you, really.
20
- There's no reason we have to thank each other.
21
Luckily, some of us still have a sense of community, right?
22
Though the kids haven't got that notion straight yet.
23
- I mean our kid. - Right, our kid.
24
Those tulips are gorgeous.
25
Oh it's the little florist on Henry, you know, all the way up?
26
Oh right!
27
They fly the bulbs in straight from Holland,
28
- That a fact? - Yeah.
29
- Do you know the one? All the way up. - Right, right.
30
What about the tooth with the damaged nerve?
31
Oh. Well they don't know. There's still some question about the prognosis.
32
-  Apparently, the nerve is not completely exposed. - Only part of it is exposed.
33
Right. There's a part that's exposed and a part that's still protected.
34
- So now, they're not going to devitalize it. - They want to give the tooth a chance.
35
We would so like to avoid root canal.
36
- Of course. - So there's an observation period while they give the nerve a chance to heal.
37
- Meantime, he's going to need caps. - You can't have implants until you're eighteen anyway.
38
You can't.
39
The permanent implants can only be done once you stop growing.
40
Naturally. I hope... I hope it all turns out all right.
41
We can only hope.
42
You know, he didn't want to tell on Zachary.
43
No, he didn't want to tell.
44
I mean it was incredible to see this child with no face left, no teeth...
45
And he just wouldn't talk.
46
I can just imagine.
47
He didn't want to tell on the kid. Like his friends would say he was a snitch. I mean let's be honest, Penelope, it wasn't only a sense of honor.
48
You could say that. But a sense of honor requires a social context.
49
So how did you finally get Zachary's name?
50
Well because we explained to Ethan that protecting this child was not going to help him.
51
We told him, if this kid thinks he can go on hitting people and getting away with it, why should he stop?
52
We told him that if we were that child's parents, we would absolutely want to know about this.
53
- Of course. - Yeah. Excuse me one second.
54
Yes Walter, thanks for getting back to me.
55
So it's in this morning's Journal. I'll read it to you.
56
"According to a study published by British journal Lancet...two Australian researchers have identified...neurological side effects of TW Pharma's anti-hypertension medication Antril... including impaired hearing and ataxia."
57
Who the hell does your press monitoring over there?
58
Yeah, you're in deep shit.
59
No, my problem is the A.S.M. You have an Annual Stockholders Meeting in two weeks.
60
- Sorry. - So you're like a... - An attorney.
61
- And yourself? - Houseware supply.
62
Penelope is a writer. She works part time in a bookstore, mostly art books and history books.
63
- A writer!
64
I co-wrote a volume about Sabean civilization.
65
Working from artifacts recovered when they resumed digs after the Ethiopia-Eritrea conflict.
66
And now I have a book coming out in January about the Darfur tragedy.
67
So you specialize in Africa.
68
I'm interested in that part of the world, yes.
69
- Do you have any other children? - There's Courtney, she is nine.
70
She's very angry at her father right now. He got rid of the hamster last night.
71
- You got rid of the hamster? - Yeah. Made such a racket at night.
72
Those things sleep during the day.
73
Ethan was going crazy, he couldn't stand the racket that hamster made.
74
I don't mind telling you, I've been wanting to get rid of the thing for the longest time.
75
So I thought, that's it. I took it out and left it on the street.
76
- You left it on the street? - I figured it was a gutter-sewer kind of animal.
77
But it was scared out of its wits, out there, on that sidewalk.
78
Truth is, they're not pets and they're not wild. Drop them in the middle of the forrest they're still unhappy. I mean where are you supposed to put them?
79
- You just left him outside? - Yeah, he did.
80
And then he tried to convince Courtney that the hamster ran away.
81
Which, of course, she was not buying.
82
- And this morning the hamster was gone? - Gone.
83
- And what about you? What do you do for a living? - I'm an investment broker.
84
Let me... I'll just gonna ask this directly.
85
Could Zachary apologize to Ethan?
86
Sure. It would be good if they talked.
87
He's got to apologize, Alan. He has to actually say he's sorry.
88
- Yeah, probably. - Well, is he sorry?
89
He didn't realize how serious it was. He's eleven years old.
90
- Eleven is not a baby. - It's not an adult either.
91
We didn't ask you, you want some coffee or tea?
92
Is there any cobbler left, Penny? She makes a mean cobbler!
93
- You got espresso? - We do!
94
- I wouldn't mind a cup. - A glass of water. Yeah. Espresso for me too, babe. And bring the cobbler. Come on, come on.
95
Please, please have a seat.
96
Thank you.
97
You got to taste this cobbler.
98
Where's the cobbler?
99
She put the cobbler in the fridge again. I don't know what language I should speak to her in.
100
- Nice couple. - Very.
101
They're nice, right? - You tell everybody I'm a writer?
102
- You are a writer. You wrote a book.
103
Good cobbler is not easy to make.
104
- What do you sell? - Decorative hardware. Door locks, handles, copper fittings. And kitchen equipment, pots and pans.
105
Is that a good living? You know, it's not like we had any banner years or anything. It was tough starting out.
106
But long as I'm out there every morning, with my catalog and my sample case, it's a living.
107
Although the cast iron roasting pans do pick up around the holidays.
108
When you saw the hamster was terrified, why didn't you bring it home?
109
- Cause I don't touch them. - You put it on the sidewalk.
110
It was in the cage. I flipped it over. No way I'm touching those things.
111
- Sugar? - No, no sugar.
112
- What kind of cobbler you make? - Appler and pear.
113
- Apple and pear? - Yeah, it's a little recipe of mine.
114
- Apple and pear, that's new to me.
115
- Apple and pear is a classic. - There's a trick to it. - Really?
116
You have to cut the pear thicker than the apple, because they cook faster.
117
- Oh, right! - She's not telling you the real secret. - Let them taste it.
118
- Very good, very good. - Delicious! - Gingerbread crumbs!
119
- Oh my god! It's just a souped-up recipe, his mother gave me this idea.
120
- Gingerbread, fantastic!
121
At least we get a new recipe out of this, right?
122
I wish my son didn't have to lose two teeth in the process.
123
Right, that's what I meant. - You have a novel way of expressing it.
124
- No. I... Excuse me.
125
Yeah, Walter.
126
No. No letters to the editor.
127
You'll just fan the flames.
128
Was it scheduled? Yeah...
129
What are these disorders? What's ataxia?
130
And in normal doses?
131
How long have you known this? And in all that time you haven't recalled it?
132
What are we talking about in revenues? Oh, oh, I see.
133
- Alan! We're all waiting for you. - Yeah, right. One second.
134
Dennis?
135
They've known about the risks for two and a half years.
136
An internal report, but no undesirable side-effects are firmly established No precautionary measures and they don't schedule a reserve. Nothing in the annual report.
137
Lack of balance, jerky gait, the works. Basically, you look like you're drunk.
138
Roughly half a billion in revenues.
139
You there?
140
Deny.
141
That dumbshit wanted us to write a letter to the editor.
142
No way we're writing a letter.
143
On the other hand, if we see this is getting picked up, we could do a press release. Like somebody's spreading false rumors two weeks out from the A.S.M. kind of thing.
144
He's calling me back.
145
Ok.
146
- I've been so busy, I hardly had time for lunch.
147
- Help yourself, help yourself.
148
Go on.
149
I know I have no manners. Where were we?
150
We were saying it would be so much nicer if me meet some other way.
151
- So this cobbler, your mother, huh? - His mother.
152
It's my mother's recipe but Pen made it.
153
- Your mother doesn't use apples and pears. - No.
154
- She's about to have an operation, poor thing. - Really? What for?
155
- Her knee.
156
She's going to get a polythylene and metallic prostheses.
157
She's wondering what's going to be left of it after the cremation.
158
Michael, that's mean.
159
She doesn't want to be buried with my father. She wants to be cremated, And put upstate next to her mother, who's all alone.
160
A couple of urns jabbering away on the shores of Lake Sebago.
161
We're very touched by how generous you're being.
162
We realize how you're trying to smooth things out here instead of making them worse.
163
- Please, it's the least we could do. - Yeah.
164
No, come on. So many parents just take their kid's side, acting like children themselves.
165
If Ethan had broken two of Zachary's teeth, I'm thinking Alan and I might have had more of a knee-jerk reaction.
166
- I'm not sure we would see the big picture. - Sure you would.
167
She's right. I'm not so sure. You would. Because we all know it could have happened the other way around.
168
So what does Zachary say? How is he experiencing this?
169
He doesn't talk much. A little overwhelmed I guess.
170
But he realizes that he disfigured his schoolmate?
171
No. No, he doesn't realize that he disfigured his schoolmate.
172
Why do you say that? Of course Zachary realizes.
173
He realizes that this violent behavior is unacceptable, not that he disfigured his schoolmate.
174
You don't like the word but unfortunately the word is appropriate.
175
- My son did not disfigure your son. - Your son disfigured our son!
176
- Come back after school, look at his mouth and teeth.
177
- Momentarily disfigured. - His mouth will be fine when the swelling goes down.
178
As for the teeth, if he needs it, we'd be willing to chip in for the best dental care.
179
We got insurance for that.
180
What we want is for the boys to patch it up, make sure nothing like this ever happens again.
181
- Let's set up a meeting. - Yeah. Exactly.
182
- Should we be there?
183
- They don't need coaching. Let them work it out like men. Like men? Alan, don't be rediculous.
184
On the other hand, maybe we don't need to be there. Maybe it's better if we weren't there, right?
185
The issue is not whether we are there, whether we are not there. The issue is, do they want to talk about this, do they want to work this out.
186
- Ethan does. - Does Zachary?
187
- We won't give him a choice. - It has to come from him.
188
Zachary acts like a thug, we're not going to wait around for him to see the light.
189
If Zachary sees Ethan in a punitive context, because he's forced to, I just don't see anything positive coming out of that.
190
Mrs. Longstreet, our son is a maniac. If you hope he'll suddenly and spontaneously get all apologetic, you're dreaming.
191
Look, I'm sorry, but I really do have to get back to the office. Nancy, you stay. You'll let me know what was decided. I'm no use to anyone anyway.
192
Women think you need the man, you need the father, like it would do any good.
193
I'm really sorry, but I can't stay either.
194
My husband has never been much of an I'll-push-the-stroller type daddy.
195
That's too bad, because it goes by so fast. Mike really liked taking care of the kids.
196
- You had a ball pushing that stroller. - Yeah, sure.
197
So... What should we decide?
198
Could you come over to our place at about 7:30, with Ethan?
199
- Well, if you want my opinion... - Yes, please.
200
- I think Zachary should come over here.
201
The victim shouldn't be the one who makes the trip.
202
- I can't be anywhere at 7:30. - Who needs you? You're useless, right?
203
- Seriously, I think it's important for his father to come. - Not tonight!
204
- Can you hear me?
205
There's not a word in the annual report. But the risk wasn't officially established. There's no proof. Call me back.
206
- Tomorrow? - Tomorrow I'm in Washington.
207
- You have business in Washington? - At the Pentagon.
208
Look, the main thing is to get the kids to talk.
209
I'll come over to your place with Zachary at 7:30 and we'll let them talk it through.
210
What? You don't seem convinced.
211
If Zachary hasn't acquired accountability skills, They'll just glare at each other, it will be disaster.
212
- "Accountability skills", Mrs. Longstreet? What are you talking about? - Zachary is not a maniac. - Yes he is.
213
Alan, don't be an idiot. Why are you saying that?
214
He's a maniac. - How does he explain what he did? - He won't talk about it.
215
- He should talk about it. - That's a lot of "shoulds", Mrs. Longstreet.
216
He should come here, he should talk about it, he should feel sorry...
217
I'm sure you're much more evolved than we are.
218
We're trying to get up to speed, but in the meantime try to indulge us.
219
Hey come on! What happened here?
220
This isn't what we are all about. - I was talking about Zachary, about him.
221
- I got that. Alan!
222
You want some more coffee? Real coffee. Coffee.
223
Thank you.
224
- Coffee, all right. - It's OK, I'll get it.
225
I see you're an art enthusiast. Yes.
226
- Bacon? - Yes, Bacon.
227
- Cruelty and splendor. - Chaos. Balance.
228
- Is Zachary interested in art? - Not as much as he should be. - Your children are?
229
- We try to make up for the lack in the school curriculum.
230
We try to get them to read, to concerts and galleries.
231
I really believe that culture can be a powerful force for peace.
232
Yeah you're so right.
233
Is cobbler cake or pie? This is an important question.
234
I was in the kitchen, thinking. Why should pizza be a pie?
235
Cobbler is cake. It there's no crust on the bottom then it can't be pie.
236
You're a gourmet chef. I like to cook.
237
It's something you have to do out of love or not at all.
238
The way I see it, if there's no curst on the bottom, then it's not a pie.
239
How about you guys? You have other kids?
240
I have another son by a former marriage.
241
You know, I was wondering. I know it's not important but...
242
Do you know what were they arguing about? Cause Ethan won't say a word.
243
Ethan wouldn't let Zachary be part of his gang. - Ethan has a gang?
244
- And he called him a snitch. Did you know that Ethan had a gang?
245
No. But I'm thrilled to hear it!
246
- Why are you thrilled? - Cause I had one. - I was the leader. - So was I.
247
What does the leader of a gang do?
248
You know, you got five, six guys who like you and they're willing to sacrifice themselves for you.
249
- Like in Ivanhoe. - Exactly, like in Ivanhoe.
250
Who even knows Ivanhoe any more? So it's another role model. Like Spiderman or whoever.
251
Well apparently you know more about it than we do.
252
Zachary wasn't quite as silent as you first said.
253
Why did he call him a snitch?
254
Forget it, silly question, right? What's the point? No one care.
255
We're not going to get into these children's quarrels.
256
- It's none of our business. - Right.
257
What is our business is this unfortunate incident. Violence is our business.
258
When I was the leader, I beat up Jimmy Leach in a fair fight and he was bigger than me.
259
- What does that do with anything, Michael? - No, nothing.
260
This is not a fair fight, these boys weren't fighting.
261
- Right, I was just remembering something. - It's not very different.
262
- Excuse me, I'm sorry there's a difference. - There's a difference.
263
What's the difference? Jimmy Leach and me, we agreed to fight.
264
- Did you mess him up? - A little.
265
Enough about Jimmy Leach. - Do you mind if I talked to Zachary?
266
- Of course not. - I would not do it without your permission.
267
- No, talk to him. That's completely fine with us. - And good luck with that.
268
- Stop it. Why did you say that?
269
- Mrs. Longstreet... - Penelope. I think we'll do better if we're on a first name basis.
270
- Penelope, you're acting on a desire to educate...
271
- I won't talk to him if you don't want me to. Go ahead, talk to him, lecture him, do whatever you want.
272
I don't understand how you feel so uninvolved here.
273
- Mrs. Longstreet... - Penelope.
274
Penelope, I'm very involved here. - My son injured another child...
275
- Deliberately. See, that's the kind of thing that irks me. We know deliberately.
276
That's what makes all the difference. The difference between what and what?
277
We're only talking about one thing here. Our kid picked up a stick and hit your kid. That's why we're here, right?
278
- Fruitless. - Right, she's right. This kind of talk is fruitless.
279
Why do you feel you need to slip in the word deliberately? What kind of lesson are you trying to teach me?
280
All right, this is getting silly.
281
My husband is all stressed out over work stuff.
282
I'll come back here tonight with Zachary and we'll let them work it out naturally.
283
- I'm not stressed out in the least. - Well I am.
284
- There's no reason to be stressed out. - Yes, there is. Yeah.
285
Well, no comment...No comment.
286
No comment!
287
What? If you recall it, you're admitting liability!
288
Recalling Antril would be admitting your liability!
289
Christmas time in the school play... - What did Zachary play?
290
Zachary played... - Ebenezer Scrooge. - accused of accounting irregularities... - Ebenezer Scrooge, right.
291
Michael, do you remember he played Scrooge? - Sure.
292
- He was wonderful. With that night bonnet. He was very funny.
293
Let's talk about it, what about the victims after the stockholders' meeting...
294
We can't recall a drug because three guys can't walk a straight line!
295
For the time being, don't make a move.
296
All right, call you right back.
297
They're in panic mode. They have the media breathing down their necks. I want a release thant doesn't sound defensive at all. Just the opposite. Go for the jugular. Something like: "TW Pharma is a target." "Attempt at manipulation of the stock two weeks before the stockholders' meeting." " Where did this study come from anyway?" "How does this suddenly drop out of a clear blue sky", etcetera.
298
Not one word about the health issue. Just one question: Who is behind the study? Who?
299
Fine.
300
Nobody said you should listen to my conversation.
301
Nobody said you should have it under my nose.
302
I'm totally forced to have it here. Against my will, believe me.
303
They just peddle this shit, right? No one is responsible.
304
In any therapeutic advance there are benefits and there are risks.
305
Yeah, I know. Still you got some funny line of work.
306
- What does that mean? - Michael, it's none of our business.
307
- Funny line of work. - What about you, what do you do?
308
- I got a normal job. - What's a normal job?
309
- I told you, I sell pots and pans. - And door handles.
310
And flush mechanisms. And lot of other stuff.
311
"Flush mechanisms", I like that, That's interesting.
312
Flush toilets are interesting. Why not?
313
- How many different kinds do you have?
314
- There are two basic kinds. You got your push button and your handle operated.
315
- Yeah, right. - Depends where your water line is.
316
- I see. - It either comes from the side near the top, or it comes from the bottom.
317
One of my store managers is an expert. I could introduce you if you want. But you'll have to hump it out to Jamaica, Queens.
318
You seem like you know your business pretty well.
319
Are you planning to sanction Zachary in any way?
320
- I don't feel well. - What's the matter, are you all right?
321
- Oh you do look pale honey. - You're all white, yeah.
322
- Nauseous. - Some Reglan, you get some Reglan?
323
- No. I'll be fine. - Coke. What you need is a coke.
324
It's not cold.
325
- It's not cold. - Thank you.
326
Just little sips. The coke wasn't in the refrigerator.
327
Have him call me back. Tell him right away.
328
Is Coke good for that? It's more for diarrhea, isn't it? No, not only. Better?
329
I think so. Mrs. Longstreet...
330
If we decide to reprimand our child, we'll do it in our own way and on our own terms.
331
- Absolutely. - What absolutely?
332
He's their kid, they're free to do as they see fit.
333
- I don't agree. - You don't agree about what, Penny?
334
- They're not free. - Is that right? Go on.
335
But don't forget, nothing has been proven here, nothing is certain.
336
Don't fuck this up.
337
If we don't get this right, Walter will be out on his ear in two weeks, and so will we.
338
Enough, Alan! Enough with the cell phone already! The here and now, god dammit!
339
Call me back and read it to me.
340
What the hell is wrong with you? Screaming at me like that! - Dennis heard every word!
341
- Good! I'm sick of that fucking cell phone, every minute of every day!
342
Listen Nancy, you should be thanking me for agreeing to come here...
343
Really? - I'm going to throw up. - No you're not.
344
- I am. - You want to use the bathroom?
345
- Nobody's forcing you to stay... - She's right, nobody's forcing you to stay.
346
- I'm dizzy. - Stare at a point in space.
347
- Hey, you can see part of the EL from here. Cool! - Get away from me. Leave me alone.
348
- Should she go to the bathroom? - Go to the bathroom if you have to throw up.
349
- Give her some Reglan. - It can't be the cobbler, can it?
350
- No, I made it yesterday. - Don't touch me!
351
- Take it easy, Doodle. - Come on, don't get all bent out of shape over nothing.
352
My husband feels that anything to do with the house, the school, the backyard, - ...is my domain. - I do not.
353
You do so. And I can understand why. It's all so excruciatingly boring. It's excruciating.
354
If it's so excruciating, why do you have children in the first place?
355
Maybe Zachary picks up on that lack of interest.
356
- What lack of interest?! - You just said it yourself!
357
Go get a bucket, go get a bucket!
358
That stupid bitch.
359
You should have gone to the bathroom. Doodle, this is rediculous. - Your suit took a hit.
360
- What? - It can't be the cobbler.
361
That much I know. - It's not the cobbler, it's nerves. This is just nerves.
362
You want to clean up in the bathroom?
363
Oh my god, my Kokoschka.
364
- Give her some Reglan. - She couldn't keep anything down right now.
365
Where's the bathroom?
366
I'll show you.
367
This is nerves, just nerves.
368
Thank you.
369
Like I always say, you can't get over something when you're under it.
370
With me it's the back of my neck.
371
- What do we do about the Kokoschka? - We can clean it. Try Lysol. Only problem is drying it.
372
Or else with plain water and you put some cologne on there.
373
- Cologne? - I got some of that Kronos I never use. The paper will warp.
374
We'll blow-dry it, then put some books on top then flatten it out. Maybe iron it like dollar bills.
375
- Oh God! - I'll buy you another one.
376
There's no other one. It's been out of print for years.
377
- I'm so sorry. - We can save it. Pen, let me do this.
378
It's a reprint from the catalog of the 1963 show in London.
379
Go get the blow-dryer and the cologne. It's in the bathroom cabinet.
380
- Her husband is in the bathroom! - He's not in the can!
381
I got most of it off. Little bit on the Dolgans...
382
Excuse me!
383
- Are you feeling better? - Yeah.
384
- Should I spray? - Where's the blow-dryer?
385
He's drying his pants.
386
Well, we'll wait. We'll put the Kouros on there last.
387
- Can I use the bathroom too? - Yes, of course. Of course.
388
I don't know what to say...
389
I am so sorry.
390
Bring the blow-dryer please.
391
God!
392
Unbelievable! Un-fucking-believable.
393
- Her cobbler is horrible. - You stuffed your face!
394
Look at my day. I have to get some food in me some time.
395
- Oh God. - What a freaking nightmare!
396
He better watch it, he's got me right on the edge. - She's horrible!
397
- Less. She's so fake.
398
- She doesn't bother me that much. - They're both horrible.
399
Why do you take their side all the time? - Sorry.
400
- I don't take their side.
401
What the hell are we doing here?
402
- I hope you're kidding. - Why do you argue with her?
403
We'd have been out of here a long time ago if you didn't bicker over every word.
404
You'd rather I was a sheep, like her husband?
405
- You think it was the cobbler? - Of course it was.
406
A little warm coke and... Bang!
407
Fuck!
408
You mitigate. You're trying to reconcile everything. - I'm not!
409
- You are. You had your gang and you were the leader, and they can do whatever they want with their son.
410
Their son is a threat to homeland security. When a kid is a menace to society it's everybody's business.
411
I can't believe she barfed all over my books!
412
When you know you're going to toss your cookies, you take precautions.
413
Oh, the Foujita! Disgusting...
414
I was right on the edge with that toilet flushing shit.
415
- You were incredible. - I held my own, right?
416
Incredible. "Jamaica, Queens", that was genius.
417
- Little piece of shit. What does he call her again? - Doodle. - Doodle... - Doodle! Yeah, I call her Doodle.
418
Oh, I'm sorry. We didn't mean anything.
419
It's just so easy to make fun of other people's pet names.
420
Michael, what do we call each other? I'm sure it's worse, right?
421
- Here, you want the blow-dryer. - Thanks.
422
We call each other darjeeling, like the tea.
423
A lot more embarrassing if you ask me.
424
- How's she feeling, is she feeling better? - Yeah, better.
425
I reacted badly. I'm ashamed.
426
I made a big deal about the catalog. I didn't really know why I did that.
427
You get so absurdly attached to these things, you don't even know why really.
428
- Pull it taut. - Hold on at the other side. I know I got it, just pull it taut. - The corners are wet. - I know, I get the corners. - It's gonna tear. - He's right, it gonna tear. - Here. - It's dry now. You put colognes right now and I finish those.
429
- What does Doodle come from? - Sorry.
430
Yankee Doodle? Cheese Doodle?
431
No, it's a song from Guys and Dolls that goes, "Doodle oodle oodle oo."
432
Oh yeah, I know that one.
433
Ours is from our honeynoon in India.
434
I called her darjeeling instead of darling. So stupid.
435
- Should I go check on her? - Go ahead, darjeeling.
436
Nancy! I was worried about you, all better?
437
Yeah, better, I think so. If you're not sure, stay away from the coffee table.
438
I left the towel in the bathtub. I didn't know where to put it.
439
Perfect.
440
You cleaned up? I'm so sorry. Everything is fine. All is well.
441
I'm sorry, I wasn't there for you. I was so focused on my Kokoschka.
442
That's all right. - No, I behaved poorly. - Please.
443
In the bathroom I was thinking.
444
Yes?
445
Maybe we glossed over the...
446
- Well I mean... - What? What is it?
447
- Name-calling is a kind of abuse. - Sure.
448
- Depends. - Right, depends.
449
Zachary has never been a violent child. He must have his reasons.
450
Like getting called a snitch. Excuse me.
451
Yeah, Walter.
452
As long as there are no victims on the panel. No victims. I don't want you sitting down with victims.
453
Deny, deny, deny. If we have to, we'll sue the Journal.
454
We'll e-mail you the draft of the press release, Walter, I'm sorry I got to go.
455
Call me a snitch, it gets a rise out of me.
456
- Unless it's ture. - What?
457
You know, the shoe fits.
458
- You think my son is a snitch? - Come on, joking around.
459
- So is yours anyway. - What do you mean so is ours?
460
- He snitched on Zachary. - We coaxed it out of him.
461
- We're completely off point here. - Maybe you coaxed, but he did snitch on him.
462
- Nancy... - Nancy what? - You think my son is a snitch?
463
- I don't think anything. Well if you don't think anything, don't say anything. Don't make insinuations.
464
Nancy, there's no reason to lose our cool here.
465
Michael and I have gone out of our way to be fair-minded and conciliating...
466
- Not so fair-minded. - Oh, really?
467
- Superficially fair-minded. - Doodle, I have to go.
468
So go, coward.
469
Nancy, right now I'm in danger of losing my most important client.
470
So this caring parent crap and the brickering that goes along with it...
471
- My son lost two teeth. Two incisors. - Yeah, right, we got that.
472
- One of them permanently. - He'll get new teeth. Better ones!
473
No one chewed his ear off!
474
It was a mistake not to consider the source of the problem.
475
There is no source. There's an 11-year-old kid who hits people, with a stick!
476
- Armed with a stick. - We took that word out.
477
- You took it out because we asked you to. - We took it out without argument.
478
A word which deliberately establishes intent and excludes any hint of a misunderstanding.
479
Which excludes childhood.
480
- I don't think I can stand this tone any more. - We're not quite on the same page, you and I. Right from the start.
481
Mr. Cowan, it is incredibly frustrating to be continued upbraided For something we ourselves admitted was a mistake.
482
Like the word "armed" wasn't right, we took it out. Strictly speaking, it certainly applies.
483
Zachary was verbally abused and over reacted. If I'm attacked, I defend myself. Especially when I'm all alone against a whole gang.
484
Well, you've certainly perked up since you tossed your cookies. Do you realize how crude that is?
485
We're all decent people. All four of us. How do we get all carried away, losing our tempers?
486
It's totally unnecessary. Michael, stop, stop metigating.
487
We're only superficially fair-minded, why should we be fair-minded at all?
488
- I'm not going to be led down that path. The path those two little shits led us down!
489
- I'm afraid Pen doesn't see things that way... - Penelope. - Sorry.
490
- So Ethan is a shit now. That really takes the cake.
491
- That's it. I really have to leave now. - Yeah so do I.
492
Go, go. I give up.
493
Hello?
494
Oh, hi Ma. No, we got some friends over but go ahead.
495
Yes, you just do whatever the doctors tell you to do.
496
Yes.
497
The what?
498
Antril? You're taking Antril... Hold on a second.
499
Antril? That crap of yours, is that Antril?
500
- My mother's taking it. - Thousands of people take it.
501
Mum, you stop taking that one immediately.
502
Do what I tell you, I'll explain later.
503
Mum, you tell Dr. Perlstein that I won't let you take it.
504
Good.
505
Why red? So who can see you?
506
Mum, that's rediculous. Mum...
507
I have to call you back I told you I have company.
508
OK. I love you. Bye-bye.
509
She got red crutches so she won't hit by a truck. In case she wanders out on the street at night.
510
They're giving her Antril for her blood pressure.
511
If she's taking it and she looks normal, I'll take her deposition.
512
Didn't I have a scarf? I don't like that attitude of yours.
513
If my mother has the slightest symptom, my name will be at the top of a class-action suit.
514
- We'll have one anyway. - I should hope so!
515
Doing the right thing is futile. Honesty is just stupidity. All it does is weaken you. You let your guard down.
516
OK, let's go Nancy. That's enough sermons and lectures for one day.
517
Go ahead, go. But let me tell you this, now that I know you two, I'm not surprised
518
What's his name? Zachary, may have behaviour issues.
519
- When you killed that hamster... - Killed?
520
- Killed. - I killed the hamster?
521
Yes. You do everything you can to make us feel guilty. You stake out the moral highground as your own, but you yourself are a murderer.
522
I definitely did not kill the hamster. Worse. You left it out there, Trembling with fear in a hostile environment. That poor critter was probably eaten by a dog or a rat.
523
- She's right about that. - What do you mean she is right? I mean it's horrible, what must have happened to that animal! I thought the hamster would be happy to be free. I was sure he'd go running around in the gutter, happy as a clam! You just left him there!
524
I can't touch those things, OK? I can't touch anything of that family. - Christ, Penny you know that! - He's afraid of rodents. Yeah, I have a fear of rodents.
525
And I have a fear of reptiles. Anything down close to the ground, that's it, all right? What about you? How come you didn't go downstairs and get it? Because I didn't know!
526
Michael said this morning the hamster ran away. So I went right out, I went all the way around the block. I went to the basement!
527
Penelope, it is completely unfair that all of a sudden I'm in the hot seat about this hamster thing. That you just had to tell them about. That's a family issue.
528
That doesn't concern anybody but us and it's got nothing to do with this situation here! And I can't believe I'm getting called a murderer in my own house!
529
- What does your house have to do with the price of tea in China? - My house! I opened the door! The door is wide open in a spirit of reconciliation. To people who should be a little grateful!
530
Keep right on stroking your own ego, It's beautiful.
531
- So you have no remorse? - I have no remorse. That animal was disgusting and I'm glad it's gone.
532
- Michael, that's ridiculous. - What's rediculous? What, have you lost your mind too?
533
Their son beats the shit out of Ethan and you're in my face over a hamster?
534
What you did with that hamster was wrong and you can't deny that. - I don't give a shit about the hamster!
535
- You'll have to give a shit tonight when your daughter get home.
536
Bring her on! I'm not going to be told how to act by a 9-year-old snotnose brat!
537
Now I agree with him there, one hundred percent.
538
- That's pathetic. - Watch it, Penelope, watch it.
539
I've kept my shirt on up till now, but you're pushing me over a line.
540
- And Ethan? - What about Ethan? - Is he sad too?
541
- Ethan's got other things on his plate, if you ask me. - Ethan wasn't so attached to Nibbles.
542
- Nibbles? What kind of pussy name is that anyway?
543
If you feel no remorse, why should our son?
544
You know what? All this consultation and consideration shit.
545
I'm sick to death of it. We were nice to you. We bought tulips. My wife dressed me up as a liberal, but the fact is I got no patience for this touchy-feely bullshit. - And I'm a temperamental son of a bitch. - We all are.
546
No, I'm sorry. We are not all temperamental sons of bitches.
547
- Not you, of course. - No, not me! Thank God! Not you, darjee, not you.
548
You're so evolved. You never go off half-cocked.
549
- Why are you being so aggressive with me? - I'm not being aggressive. I'm being honest.
550
Yes, you are being aggressive! You put this little bash together and I let you recruit me...
551
- You let me recruit you? - Yes. That's so disgusting.
552
No, it's not. You're an advocate for civilized behavior, well that's fine with me.
553
Yes I'm advocate for civilized behavior, you bet I am! And it's a good thing somebody is!
554
You think it's better to be a son of a bitch?
555
Nobody said that, nobody critisized you that! - You did!
556
- We did not. What was I supposed to do? Was I supposed to sue you?
557
Never talk to you and tear you to pieces through the insurance company?
558
- Stop it, Penny. - Stop what?! - You're blowing this all out of proportion. - I don't care!
559
You do everything you can to avoid the pettiness and you wind up Humiliated and completely alone!
560
Yes, Walter. Well, let them prove it. Prove it!
561
From where I sit, the best thing for us to do... We're born alone and we die alone! Who wants a little Scotch?
562
Walter, I'm in a meeting right now. I'll call you when I get back to the office. That's the thing. I'm living with a totally negative person.
563
- Who's negative? - Me.
564
This was the worst possible idea! We should never have had this meeting.
565
- I told you so. - You told me so? Yeah! - You told me we should never have this meeting?
566
- I didn't think it was a very good idea. - It was a good idea.
567
- Oh come on. Who wants a little? You told me you think it wasn't a good idea?
568
- As I recall. - As you recall! - Maybe just a little slip.
569
- Don't you have to go? At this point in the game, I may as well have a little drink.
570
You tell me again we didn't both agree on this!
571
Calm down, Penelope, this is going nowhere.
572
Who said not to touch the cobbler this morning? Who said we should keep the rest for the Cowan's? Who said that?!
573
That was very nice of you. - What's that to do with anything? - What do you mean what's that to do with anything?
574
- Guests are guests. - You're lying, you're lying!
575
You know, my wife actually had to drag me here today.
576
When you grow up with a certain John Wayne idea of manhood, The impulse in this kind of situation is not to talk it through.
577
- I thought the role model was Ivanhoe. - Same basic concept. - Another aspect. - Another aspect! Just how much are you going to humiliate yourself?
578
I can see I dragged him here for nothing.
579
- What did you expect, Doodle? - That is a ridiculous nickname.
580
Some revelation about universal values? This scotch is unbelievable.
581
See that? 18 years old, single malt, from a tiny place in Scotland where they still grow their own barley.
582
What about the tulips? Who got them?
583
All I said was it's too bad we didn't get any tulips.
584
I never said anything about going all the way up to Henry street at dawn.
585
Don't get all bent out of shape over this, Penelope, It's not worth it.
586
He got the tulips! Him and only him!
587
Don't we get a drink?
588
Penelope and I would like a drink too.
589
Pretty funny when you think about it.
590
A devotee of Ivanhoe and John Wayne but he's scared to pick up an itty-bitty mouse.
591
- Stop the hamster. Stop. - She's right, it's laughable.
592
- And her? - I don't think that will be necessary.
593
- Pour me a drink, Michael. - No. - Michael! - No.
594
What is wrong with you, Michael? Fine, fine. Drink, What does it matter?
595
- Is drinking bad for you or something? - No, no, it's great for me.
596
Now I don't know...
597
- Mr. Cowan... - Alan. Alan...
598
See, you and I didn't exactly hit it off I live with a man who has decided once and for all that life is synonymous with mediocrity.
599
It's very hard to live with a man who's walled himself up in that idea, who doesn't want to change anything, who never gets excited about anything...
600
What are you telling this for? He could care less.
601
You have to believe, you have to believe some possible correction.
602
He's the last guy on earth you should be telling this to.
603
I'll talk to anyone I damn well please!
604
Who the fuck is that now?
605
Mother. Hi, Ma.
606
He's fine. He got his teeth knocked out but he's fine.
607
He's in pain, it hurts, it'll pass.
608
Ma, I told you I have company. I'll call you back, remember? Yeah, bye.
609
- He's still in pain? - No.
610
- Then why do you worry your mother? - He has to worry, he can't help himself.
611
Ok, Penelope, that's enough. What is this drama queen bullshit?
612
Penelope, nobody cares about anything outside himself.
613
Sure, we'd all like to believe in some kind of possible correction, One we could author ourselves, completely free of selfish consideration. Like you're writing this book about Darfur... Which is great!
614
I understand how you might say, OK, I'll pick a massacre, History is full of them, and I'm going to write a book.
615
Everybody has to save himself somehow. I'm not writing this book to save myself.
616
You haven't read it, you don't even know what's in it! Whatever.
617
The smell of Kronos is killing me.
618
- It fucking reeks! - You didn't exactly skimp. - I'm so sorry. - It's my fault. I sprayed like a madwoman. Why can't things be easier?
619
Why does everything have to be so exhausting?
620
You think too much. Women think too much.
621
There's an original response? I don't know what that means, to think too much.
622
And I don't understand how you can go on living without some moral sense of the world.
623
Look at me, I'm living! Michael, shut up.
624
Miserable complicity! Just disgusting.
625
- What happened to your sense of humor? - I don't have a sense of humor, and I don't want one.
626
If you ask me, the couple is the most terrible ordeal God ever inflicted on us.
627
Ah, marvelous. - The couple and the family.
628
- No one is forcing you to air this out in front of us, Michael. And I might add, it's a little indecent.
629
- That doesn't bother him. - You agree with me, don't you?
630
Look, this is all, beside the point.
631
- Alan, say something. - He has a right to his ideas.
632
- That doesn't mean he has to advertise them. - Yeah, maybe.
633
We don't care about their marriage.
634
We're here about a problem with the kids. We don't care about their marriage.
635
- Yes, except... - Except what?
636
- It's related. - Of course it's related.
637
Ethan's getting two of his teeth broken is related to our marriage?
638
- Of course it is. - Sorry I don't follow you.
639
Take a step back and look at the situation we're in.
640
Chrldren suck the life out of you and leave us old and empty. It's the law of nature. You see these young couples, laughing all the way to the alter. You think they don't know. Poor fuckers have no idea. They're happy. Nobody tells y ou this stuff in the beginning.
641
I get this army buddy of mine is going to have a kid with his new girlfriend.
642
I say to him, "A kid at our age? what are you stupid?"
643
"You got ten, fifteen good years left before you get cancer or have a stroke," "and you're gonna saddle yourself with a fucking kid?"
644
- That's not really what you think. - Yes it is. - Of course it's what I think, even worse.
645
- Yeah, you're debasing yourself, Michael.
646
Is that right? Stop crying, Penelope. Makes it worse.
647
Of course, of course.
648
- Excellent, isn't it? - So excellent. - Could I interest you in a cigar?
649
- No cigars in the house! - Too bad.
650
- Were you going to smoke a cigar now, Alan?
651
I do what I want, Nancy. If I want to smoke a cigar, I smoke a cigar.
652
I won't smoke it because I don't want to upset Penelope, Who's already on edge, to put it mildly.
653
Oh, quit snuffling like that, she's right.
654
When women cry, men are pushing to their breaking point.
655
Although unfortunately, I must say that Michael's point of view is completely justified.
656
Yeah. Yeah, sure, go ahead.
657
Put "New York" and a specific time of day. It's unbearable!
658
The time you send it. It has to be hot off the press.
659
No, not "questions". "Deplores". Questions is wishy-washy.
660
I live with this night and day. - One second.
661
- Our lives are chopped up by the cell phone. - Nancy, this is very important.
662
- It's always very important. What's happening somewhere else is always more important.
663
Not "strategy". "Scheme". A scheme surfacing two weeks from the company's posting. In the street. At the dinner table. Everywhere.
664
"A study" in quotes. Put the word "study" in quotes.
665
I don't even protest anymore. Unconditional surrender.
666
- I feel like I'm going to vomit again. - Where's that bucket? How am I supposed to know?
667
Then just quote me.
668
- Can you stand over the bucket please? - Pen! It's all right. We're set up to handle this now.
669
...according to TW Pharma attorney Alan Cowan. AP, Reuters, major newspapers, trade journals, the whole shebang.
670
- What's wrong? - She's gonna throw up again.
671
- You're so caring, it's touching. - I'm worried.
672
I didn't get that, my mistake.
673
Oh come on Nancy, will you? You and I don't have to do this.
674
Their marriage is going downhill, we don't have to try to compete with them.
675
What gives you the right to say our marriage is going downhill?
676
Yeah, Walter.
677
Yeah, I just had it read back. They're sending it over to you. Manipulation. Manipulation of the stock price. Walter, I'll call you back in a minute. - I didn't say it. Steven did.
678
- Michael. - I won't let you judge our family. - Then don't judge our son either.
679
That's different! Your son brutalized our son!
680
They're young, they're kids, kids roughhouse in the playground. Always have always will, it's a rule of nature. - No it isn't! - Sure it is.
681
It takes a little education to substitute the rule of law for violence.
682
The origin of law, of course you know, is brute force.
683
Maybe for cavemen, not in this world. - Tell me about this world!
684
- Boring! This conversation is boring.
685
Penelope, I believe in the god of carnage. The god whose rule has been unchallenged since time immemorial.
686
You're interested in Africa, right?
687
- What's the matter? - Don't worry about me.
688
- Nancy! - I'm just fine.
689
See, I just got back from the Congo. They got kids there, trained to kill at the age of eight. In the course of their childhood, they might kill hundreds of people. They'll kill with a machete, a shotgun, a Kalash, a thumper.
690
So obviously when my kid busts some other kid's tooth, even two teeth, with a bamboo switch by the sandbox, I'm not quite as shocked and indignant as you are.
691
- Well you should be. - Thumper. - Yes, that's why they call a grenade launcher.
692
- That's what I call it. - You all right? - Just fine.
693
- What's wrong with her? - It's bile, nothing.
694
Don't you tell me about Africa! I know all about suffering in Africa.
695
I don't doubt it. That's all I've been thinking about for months!
696
Don't get her started on this, please!
697
- You know I'm actually starting to like you. - Shut up!
698
- Talk about commitment to world peace and stability. - Shut the fuck up, Michael!
699
- You sure about that? - Very sure. Do me some good.
700
We live in New York. We don't live in Kinshasa! We live in New York City!
701
With the customs of western society. What happens in a Brooklyn playground is about western values! To which, like it or not, I happen to subscribe.
702
Beating your husband must be one of those customs then...
703
- I'm warning you, Michael! - She was all over you like a bad rash!
704
- If I were you it would melt my heart.
705
- He's making fun of you, do you believe it? I don't care about this...
706
No, really. Morally, we're supposed to overcome our impulses but there are times you don't want to overcome them.
707
I mean, who wants to say a "Hail Mary" when having sex?
708
- Can you buy this scotch around here? - No, this very likely no.
709
Thumper!
710
- Thumper, really. - Yeah. Thumper. So it is called.
711
- Why don't you just say grenade launcher? - Because it's a term.
712
Just like they say "kalash" and not Kalashnikov or AK-47.
713
- Who is they? - That's enough, Nancy, that's enough.
714
Hotshot firebrands like my husband, you got to understand, It's hard for them to get excited about what happens down the block.
715
Exactly. I don't see why. I don't see why.
716
We're all citizens of the world. I don't see why we shouldn't have some sense of community.
717
Penelope, enough for the highfalutin clap trap!
718
I'm gonna kill him. Yeah.
719
She's right! It's unbearable after a while.
720
"Brazen". a brazen attempt to... There you go.
721
He sighed off the rest? Sure.
722
What were we talking about? Thumpers?
723
We were saying that, dispite my husband thinks, Whether it happens here or other parts of the world, we must be collectively concerned. "Collectively concerned".
724
Nancy, it's absurd to drink in your condition.
725
What condition? I'm perfect.
726
That's interesting... Yeah?
727
No, no interviews before we get this release out.
728
Mr. Cowan, would you please put an end to this nerve-racking conversation?
729
No way. The stockholders won't give a shit. The stockholders...
730
Nancy what are you... Are you out of your fucking mind?
731
- There. - Shit! - Oh my god. - Way to go!
732
- The blow-dryer! - What is wrong with you?
733
I can't believe this! I got everything in there. It's brand new, I spent hours setting it up!
734
I can't believe you did that. That was an irresponsible thing to do.
735
My whole life was in there!
736
Take out the battery and SIM card. How to do that?
737
I just got it, I don't know! They thikn it's funny, they think it's funny! Penelope, it's not funny!
738
My husband has spent the entire afternoot drying thing! - Forget it. It's over. - You gotta wait.
739
You want to use the phone? I must say...
740
What...What must you say, Michael?
741
No, I don't even know what to say.
742
I'd say it feels better like this, wouldn't you?
743
Men get so attached to their toys. It diminishes them. They lose their credibility. I liked this guy once and then I saw him carrying this rectangular bag. ut with a shoulder strap. A man's bag, but with a shoulder strap! It was over!
744
A bag with a shoulder strap, that's the worst. But the cell phone always at his fingertips is the worst, too.
745
A man should have both hands free.
746
I've got a John Wayne idea of manhood, too.
747
What was it he had? A Colt '45. Something that empties a room...
748
Any man that doesn't give off those loner vibes just doesn't come off as having any substance...
749
So Michael, I guess you are happy now.
750
Our touchy-feely-whatever you said is coming apart at the seams. But you know what? This almost feels good. In my opinion.
751
Yeah, well in my opinion, some people can hold their liquor better than others.
752
- I'm as normal as I can be. - Yeah, right.
753
I'm beginning to see things with a pleasant serenity.
754
That's good! "A pleasant serenity"!
755
I can't understand why you're wasting yourself, right out in the open, darjeeling.
756
- Shut the hell up. - Alan, relax.
757
- No cigars in the house! - Hoyo de Monterrey. Partagas D number4, you got your Hoyo Coronation.
758
- Where did you get these? - You don't want to know. - Seriously. - The Spanish connection. My cookware guy. His best friend is going with a flight attendant. Brings in like two boxes a week.
759
You can't smoke in a house with an asthmatic child! And why are you telling him your whole life story?
760
- Who has asthma? - Our son. - We had a goddamn hamster, didn't we?
761
- It's true that pets aren't good when you're asthmatic.
762
- Not good at all! - Even goldfish aren't necessarily recommended.
763
Do I have to listen to this crap?
764
I guess I'm the only one who doesn't see things with pleasant serendity.
765
The truth is, I've never been so unhappy. Unhappiest day of my life.
766
You're an unhappy drunk.
767
Michael, every word out of your mouth just slays me.
768
I don't get drunk. I had a sip of your shitty 18-year old single malt... that you trot out like it's the 18 wonder of the world.
769
I don't get drunk, and believe me I wish I could. It would be such a relief to drown every little sorrow in a good stiff drink.
770
My husband is unhappy, too.
771
Look at him. All hunched over. Like he was left on the side of the road.
772
I think this is the unhappiest day of his life, too.
773
- It is! - I'm sorry, Doodle.
774
Hello?
775
Hello?
776
Mum! I told you I have company, remember?
777
Because it's medication thant can kill you! It's poison!
778
Mum, someone here who can explain.
779
- Here! Tell her! - Tell her what?
780
Tell her what you know about that poison shit of yours.
781
What can he tell her? He doesn't know anything.
782
Hello, ma'am, how are you?
783
No... Are you in pain?
784
Yeah...the operation will fix that.
785
The other leg too, huh?
786
No, I'm not an orthopedist. She keeps calling me doctor.
787
Doctor, what a laugh! Hang up!
788
Yeah! Do you have any balance issues?
789
No, of course not, not at all. It can't kill you. Don't listen to what people say.
790
It's probably a good idea not to take it for a while. Just until this operation is behind you.
791
Yes, sounds like you're in excellent shape. You got that Ma? You stop taking that medication!
792
Do as a told, all right? I love you.
793
I can't take her anymore.
794
- The shit I put up with. - All right, should we wrap this up?
795
Should I come back tonight with Zachary? Let's decide.
796
This is getting to be like, who cares? That is what we're here for, after all.
797
Now I'm going to be sick. Where's that bucket?
798
That's enough!
799
I'd say both sides share the blame. There you are, both sides share the blame.
800
- Are you serious? - Excuse me?
801
- That's what you really think? - It's what I think, yes.
802
My son Ethan, who took codeine last night at three in the morning, he shares the blame?
803
He's not necessarily innocent.
804
Get out my house. Get the fuck out of my house!
805
My bag! What is going on here? They're totally lost it.
806
- Alan, do something! - "Alan, do something"
807
Shut your mouth! She broke my make-up mirror and my perfume!
808
Stand up for me. Why don't you stand up for me?
809
- Let's go, Nancy. - It's not like I'm strangling her!
810
- What did I do to you?
811
- The blame is not shared! The victim and the criminal are not the same!
812
- The criminal?! - Oh give it a fucking rest, Penelope! Enough of these idealistic theories shit!
813
- Which I believe in. - You believe, you believe!
814
This crush you got on these Sudan sambos is spilling over into everything now!
815
I am horrified. How can you be so openly despicable?
816
Because I feel like it. I feel like being openly despicable.
817
One day you'll understand the sheer horror of what's happening in that part of the world, And you'll be ashamed of you inability to take action, of your contemptibly nihilistic attitude.
818
Yes, darjeeling, you're so wonderful! - You're the best and the brightest! - Yes I am! Yes I am!
819
Let's get out of here Alan. These people are monsters.
820
- Stop it, Nancy. - No, no. I want to drink some more. I want to get drunk off my ass.
821
This bitch throws my bag against a wall and nobody lifts a finger.
822
- I want to be blink drunk! - You're drunk enough.
823
How can you let her call our son a criminal?
824
We came over here to work things out... They insult us, browbeat us, they lecture us about being good citizens of the planet.
825
I'm glad our son kicked the shit out of your son, And I wipe my ass with your human rights!
826
A little booze and bang! Her true self comes out.
827
What happened to that gracious, demure woman with the soft eyes...
828
- I told you, I told you! - What did you tell him?
829
That she was fake. This women is totally fake. I'm sorry.
830
- When exactly did you say that? - When you were drying your pants!
831
You had known her 15 minutes and you already knew she was a fake?
832
- I pick up on these things in people very quickly. - She does. - I just have a nose for it.
833
- Fake, what does that mean? I don't want to listen to this. Why do you put me through this, Alan?
834
Relax, Nancy...
835
She's a complete phony. She doesn't care any more than you do.
836
It's true. - He said it's true. - They don't give a shit!
837
It's obvious from the beginning, they don't give a shit.
838
- She doesn't give a shit either. - Like you do?
839
Let him talk, honey. Explain to me, Michael, exactly how you care. What does that mean anyway? You're more credible when you're being openly despicable.
840
Truth is, nobody here cares. Except maybe Penelope. One must acknowledge her integrity.
841
I don't need your acknowledgment! I don't need your acknowledgment!
842
But I do care. I really do care.
843
Yes Doodle we care in a hysterical way, Not like heroic figures of a social movement.
844
I saw your friend Jane Fonda on TV the other day.
845
Made me want to run out and buy a Ku Klux Klan poster.
846
My friend Jane Fonda? What the hell does that mean?
847
You're the same breed. You're the same kind of involved, problem-solver woman.
848
Those are not the women we like. The women we like are sensual, crazy, shot full of hormones.
849
The gatekeepers of the world, the ones who want to show off how perceptive they are, Huge turnoff.
850
Even poor Michael, your own husband is turned off... Don't you speak for me.
851
We don't give a shit about what women you like!
852
Where do you get off spouting these opinions?
853
You're one man whose opinions we don't give a shit about!
854
She is screaming. A quartermaster on a slave ship.
855
What about her? She doesn't scream? She didn't just scream that your little asshole was right to beat up ours?
856
He was right! At least our kid isn't a little wimpy-ass faggot! Yours is a fucking snitch!
857
Let's go Alan, why are we still in this house?
858
Here, this is what I think of these stupid tulips! Your hideous flowers!
859
Worst day of my life, too.
860
