On January 11 at 2:30 pm ...
2
This is our memory, then you will do yours.
3
Following a bombardment at Brooklyn Bridge Park ...
4
Zachary Cowan, 11, armed with a stick, ...
5
He hit our son, Ethan Longstreet, in the face.
6
(Pen) This gesture, in addition to the swelling of the upper lip, ...
7
He caused the breaks of the two incisors ...
8
.. and compromised the nerve of the right incisor.
9
- Armed?
10
- Do not you like "armed"?
11
Michael, how can you say, "What's a stick?"
12
- "What had" ... yeah. - "What a Stick!"
13
- "Which had"...
14
We thought the Brooklyn Bridge Park was more secure than Hillside.
15
We've always said, "The Brooklyn Bridge Park is fine, Hillside no."
16
- Unbelievable!
17
Thank you for coming ...
18
It is much better not to let yourself be carried away by your own emotionality.
19
We are thanking you.
20
We do not have to thank each other for each other.
21
Fortunately, there is still an idea of ​​civil coexistence, is not it?
22
Yeah, even if our children have not grabbed the concept well.
23
-Also, not ours. -Our ... not ours!
24
Those tulips are gorgeous.
25
I took them from the florist on top of Henry.
26
Sure!
27
It makes them come from Holland,
28
- Cheap. - SÃƒÂ¬.
29
Did you understand what it is? - Sure.
30
What will happen to the tooth with compromised nerve?
31
You do not know yet. At present, the prognosis has not been dissolved.
32
It seems that the nerve ... is not completely uncovered.
33
- It's only partially. - (Pen) There is a discovery and a protected part.
34
- Do not devalue them for now. - So the tooth can heal.
35
Yeah, to avoid a canal cure.
36
-Of course! For a while, they will keep the nerve in sight.
37
- They will put capsules on it ... - No plants up to 18 years old.
38
- You can not.
39
You can only put it at the end of development.
40
It's natural. Well, we hope everything goes for the best.
41
We can only hope.
42
Listen ... Ethan ... did not want to accuse Zachary.
43
No, he did not want to!
44
It was amazing to see this disfigured little boy, with no teeth, ...
45
.. who refused to speak.
46
I can imagine.
47
Well, in truth, he did not want to go by spy, it was not just a sense of honor!
48
Honor requires a suitable social environment.
49
How did you get the name of Zachary?
50
We explained to Ethan that, protecting him, he would not have helped.
51
We told him: "If he lets him beat others, he will continue."
52
If we were the parents of that child, we would have wanted to know it.
53
- Obviously. - SÃƒÂ¬. Excuse me for a moment.
54
SÃƒÂ¬, Walter? Thank you for recalling me.
55
It's on the "Journal" this morning, I read it.
56
"According to a study published in 'Lancet ... there have been some neurological side effects ... of Antril, the drug against hypertension ... ranging from lowering hearing to atassia."
57
Who the hell is holding the print, huh?
58
Yeah, you're in shit.
59
The problem is that the general shareholders' meeting is in two weeks
60
- Sorry. - So she's ... - Lawyer.
61
- And you, on the other hand? -Thanking home articles.
62
- She is a writer and works part-time in an art library.
63
- Writer!
64
I participated in a collective work on Saba and her civilization, ...
65
... from the recovery of the excavations after the war between Eritrea and Ethiopia.
66
But now I'm working on a book on Darfur's tragedy.
67
- An expert in Africa.
68
- I'm interested in that part of the world.
69
Do you have other children? -SÃ¬, Courtney, nine years old.
70
(Pen) She has her with her father because she has been released from the hamster yesterday.
71
- Is he released from the hamster? -SÃƒÂ¬! It was very loud at night.
72
They sleep in the daytime.
73
Ethan was hysterical, he could not bear the whole chaos.
74
Actually, I too could not wait to get rid of it.
75
I caught it and I dropped it in the street.
76
- Did you give it up in the street? - I thought they were sewage animals!
77
ln reality, on the sidewalk, that thing was petrified!
78
They are not wild or domestic, you do not know where to throw them!
79
So she ... abandoned him out there?
80
Yeah, and she tried to let Courtney believe she had run away.
81
she did not believe it.
82
- And this morning, the hamster was "gone". - That's right.
83
- What do you do about it? - They are a financial operator.
84
Um ... let me make a direct question.
85
- Zachary can apologize to Ethan?
86
- Sure. They have to meet.
87
You have to apologize, Alan! If nothing else, you must say he is sorry.
88
- It is probable. - Ma Ã¨ cosÃƒÂ¬? Are you sorry?
89
She does not realize the gravity of her gesture, she's only 11 years old.
90
- At age 11 there are no more children. - But not adults!
91
Do you want a cafe or a tea?
92
Was it a bit of fruit cake? Make a cake crazy!
93
- Can I have an espresso? - Sure. - I would like.
94
- A glass of water. - Also for me an espresso and bring the cake! Come.
95
Please make yourselves comfortable.
96
- Thank you.
97
You have to taste that cake!
98
Where's the cake?
99
He put it back in the fridge. In what language do I have to speak to that woman?
100
- What a lovely couple. - Very.
101
- They're cute, right? - Do you tell everyone I'm a writer?
102
- You did, you wrote a book!
103
It's not easy to make a good fruit cake.
104
- What does it sell? - Ornamental items: locks, handles, copper objects. And kitchen utensils: pots and pans.
105
And do you earn well? "I have not had particularly exciting years. At first it was tough.
106
..I am going out every morning with the sample and the catalog, field!
107
- Cast iron pans have a peak at Christmas.
108
When did he see the scared hamster, why did not he bring him home?
109
- I do not touch them like that. - He put it on the sidewalk.
110
It was in the box, I dropped it. I can not really touch them.
111
- Sugar? - No, no sugar.
112
- What fruit put into the cake? - Apples and pears.
113
- Apples and pears? - SÃƒÂ¬. It's my little recipe.
114
- Apples and pears ... It's a novelty for me.
115
- It's a classic, but there is a secret. - Oh, really?
116
You have to cut the largest pears of apples, because they bake before.
117
- Oh, here! - It's not the real secret. - Let's taste it!
118
- Really good. - Exquisite. - Crushed gingerbread.
119
- Oh God! - It's the original recipe, just a little more elaborate. - He gave me his mother.
120
- Gingerbread! Fantastic.
121
At least, this trouble made us discover a new recipe.
122
If my son did not give us two teeth it was better.
123
- That was what I meant. -It is a way of expressing it.
124
I'm sorry.
125
SÃƒÂ¬, Walter?
126
No, no letter to the director.
127
We do not burn controversy.
128
Do you have coverage? So?!
129
What kind of disturbances are there? What is the atassia?
130
And with normal doses?
131
How far do you know it? Why did not you retreat, then?
132
Which business tour is it about? Oh, I understand!
133
- Alan? We are waiting. - I'll come in for a moment.
134
Dennis?
135
They were aware of the risks for two and a half years.
136
An internal communication, where side effects are not specified. No precautionary measure, no coverage, and no annual report.
137
Lack of balance, slow motion in practice, you move like a drunk.
138
About half a billion of turnover.
139
You are there?
140
Deny!
141
That whimper wanted to write to the editor of the newspaper.
142
You do not write to any newspaper.
143
Anyway, in the event of a reaction, we will release a statement, such as "False voices circulate two weeks from the General Assembly".
144
No, he reminds me so much.
145
Ok.
146
- Today I could not have lunch.
147
- Oh, serve it as well! Take.
148
- Here it is.
149
I know it's not the way to behave. We were saying?
150
We said it would be better to know us in different circumstances.
151
- So this cake is her mother? - His mother!
152
The recipe is my mother, but Pen has made it.
153
- Your mother does not use apples and pears. - No.
154
- It's about to be operated. - Oh, what?
155
- To the knee.
156
They will put a rotary polyethylene and metal denture.
157
And she wants to know what will remain after the cremation!
158
Do not be naughty.
159
Instead of being buried near my father, he wants to be cremated and brought to the north, near the mother, who is alone.
160
A pair of urns chatting infinitely over the banks of a lake.
161
We are very impressed with your availability.
162
We know you want to make things easier, instead of exasperating them.
163
- It's the least we can do. - SÃƒÂ¬!
164
There are so many parents who take the children's part, becoming more infant than they are.
165
If Ethan had broken two teeth at Zachary, maybe we would have reacted badly.
166
- What if we had your width of views? - Yes, yes.
167
- I doubt it. - Yeah, because we could've been in your place.
168
What does Zachary say about this story? How did he get it?
169
Does not say much, I think it's confused.
170
- Do you realize you've disfigured a companion?
171
No! No, you do not realize you have ... "disfigured" your companion!
172
Why do you say so? Of course he realizes it.
173
She realizes that violent behavior is not permissible, but she has not disfigured anyone.
174
Unfortunately, the word is appropriate.
175
- My son did not disfigure your son. - On the contrary, he did!
176
- I'll go back to school and see you. - It is momentarily disfigured.
177
Your mouth will come back soon.
178
For teeth we will pay the best dentist.
179
There is insurance.
180
We just want to make peace and that there is not much more.
181
- Then we set a meeting. - SÃƒÂ¬.
182
- With us present?
183
- They do not need protectors. If they will shake it from men. - Stop it.
184
Perhaps it is true, maybe we should not be there. I think it's better.
185
The question is not whether or not to be there ... but if they want to talk and clarify.
186
- Ethan, sÃƒÂ¬. - And Zachary?
187
- There will be no choice. But he must leave him.
188
He acted as a thug, do not expect us to start thinking.
189
If Zachary sees Ethan in a punitive context, because he's forced ... I do not see how the result can be positive.
190
Our son is a crazy person ... she is deluded if she hopes to apologize spontaneously.
191
Sorry, I have to go back to the office ... but you, Nancy, stay here, so make a decision, so much I would not be useful.
192
Women think that the man, his father, is needed, as if he were to serve something.
193
Sorry, but I have to go too.
194
My husband has never been a pope he liked to push the stroller.
195
Too bad, they grow so fast! You liked being with the kids.
196
- He loved to push the stroller. - Sure.
197
So what do we do?
198
- Can you go to us at 19:30 with Ethan?
199
- Well, if you want my opinion ... - Yeah, please.
200
It's Zachary who should come here.
201
The victim should not get uncomfortable.
202
At 19:30 I can not be there. Who needs you? You're not useful.
203
- I think it's important that there is also the father. - But not tonight.
204
- Do you feel me now?
205
The annual report does not mention it, but the risk is not ascertained. There is no evidence. Make me call back from him.
206
- Tomorrow? - Tomorrow I'm in Washington.
207
Do you have customers in Washington? - The Pentagon.
208
The important thing is for the kids to meet.
209
I'll be here with Zachary at 7:30 pm. Let the kids clarify.
210
What's that? I do not feel convinced.
211
If Zachary does not come here already accountable ... they will look cagnesco!
212
- Already accountable? But what do you talk about? - Zachary is not crazy. - It's not a crazy person! - Lo Ã¨.
213
- Do not be crazy. Why do you say so?
214
- It's crazy. - How do you explain his gesture? - Do not talk about it.
215
- But it should. - She says a little bit of "should."
216
"He should come, he should talk, he should apologize ..."
217
He will be more competent than us.
218
We will try to improve, but she is indulgent.
219
Hey! Come on! But what happens now?
220
- That was not the purpose. - I'm telling him about Zachary.
221
- I understood it, thank you! - Alan!
222
- You want another cafe? A good coffee. -CaffÃƒÂ¨ ...
223
Thank you.
224
- A cafe, okay. -Tranquilla, Pen, I think about it.
225
- I see you're interested in art. - SÃƒÂ¬.
226
- Bacon. - SÃƒÂ¬, Bacon.
227
- "CrudeltÃ ° e splendore"! - "Chaos and Balance".
228
-Zachary is interested in art? - Not what it should. And her children?
229
- Let's fill the inevitable school gaps.
230
- We bring them to concerts and exhibitions.
231
- We believe that culture is a powerful force for peace.
232
- Right.
233
Is it a cake or a tart, if it's stuffed? It's important...
234
I thought, "Can the pizza be called 'tart'?"
235
This is a pie, the tart has the base of pastafrolla.
236
- She's a cook overwhelmed. - I like cooking.
237
Or you do it for passion or not ...
238
.. and I say it is tart if it has the pastafrolla base.
239
- Do you have other children?
240
- I have a son from a previous marriage.
241
I was wondering, although I know it's not important, ...
242
... you know what the reason is, because Ethan does not say anything.
243
Ethan did not want to get Zachary into his gang. - Does Ethan have one?
244
- And he gave him the spy. - Did you know Ethan has a band?
245
- No, but I'm having fun!
246
- Why do you enjoy it? - I had one too, I was the boss. - Me too.
247
And who is the head of a band?
248
Have some little boy who admires you, ready to sacrifice for you ...
249
- Like in "Ivanhoe". - That's right!
250
- But who knows more "Ivanhoe" ?! - There are now models like Spiderman.
251
Then you know more of us ...
252
So Zachary has not been so silent.
253
Why did he give him a spy?
254
Let yourself be, it's a curiosity, this is not the point, we do not care.
255
- Better do not pinch
256
- It does not concern us. - Exactly.
257
What we are all about is this incident: violence concerns us.
258
When I was headed, I beat Jimmy Lich, barking ... ... and he was more than I was.
259
- What's this all about? - Nothing.
260
- They did not bother.
261
- Sure. It was just a reminder. - There is not much difference.
262
- Excuse me, but what is it? - There's a difference.
263
- And what is it? - I and Jimmy wanted to do it.
264
- Did it hurt you badly? - Just a little bit.
265
Just with Jimmy Lich. Are you sorry ... if I talk to Zachary?
266
- Of course not. - I would never do it without your permission.
267
- Talk to him, okay for us. - With best wishes...
268
Stop it, Alan. Why do you say so?
269
- Mrs. Longstreet ... - Penelope! No formalities.
270
Penelope ... she acts with the desire to educate ...
271
- If you prefer, I do not talk to him. - No, do whatever he wants.
272
It's weird that she feels so involved.
273
- Mrs. Longstreet ... - Penelope!
274
Penelope, I'm involved. My son hurt another kid.
275
- Intentionally. - These things irritate me ... Intentionally, yes.
276
- That makes a difference. - The difference between what and what?
277
Our son has beaten yours, so we're here.
278
- It's useless. - It's true, talking so is useless.
279
So what lesson do you want to teach me using the word "intentionally"?
280
So the conversation is ridiculous.
281
My husband is stressed out for work issues.
282
I'll be back tonight with Zachary and let everything get resolved.
283
- I'm not stressed. - Well, I do.
284
- There is no reason to be stressed. - Yes, instead. - SÃƒÂ¬?
285
Well, no comment. No comment!
286
No comment!
287
Thing?! To withdraw it is how to admit responsibility.
288
Retreating Antril would be like admitting responsibility.
289
In the Christmas recitation at school, what did Zachary do?
290
- The part of Ebenezer Scrooge. - Ebenezer Scrooge ... It's true!
291
- Michael, remember when he did Scrooge? -Sure.
292
- It was wonderful. - With that hat ...
293
We will deal with the patients after ...
294
We can not withdraw a medication because three guys can not walk straight!
295
For now, do nothing.
296
All right, I'll call you.
297
I'm panicked! Printing is with his breath on his neck. I want a statement that does not have to sound like a denial. Let's talk about it, let's attack them, like: ... .. "TW Pharma is the victim of a stock price manipulation ..." "... two weeks from the shareholders' meeting." And then, "Why does this story jump out of nowhere?"
298
Not a word on the question "health", only one question: ... .. "Who is behind this investigation?"
299
Good.
300
Nobody forced me to listen to my phone calls.
301
Nobody forced her to put them under my nose.
302
You're wrong, I'm forced to do it here and against my will.
303
GiÃƒÂ ... They sell their shit and then they wash their hands.
304
In the field of therapeutics, any progress involves benefits and risks.
305
I know, anyway ... you do an ambiguous job.
306
- What does it mean? - Michael, they are not our business.
307
- It's an ambiguous craft. - And what do you do?
308
- A normal craft. - And what is a normal craft?
309
- I sell pots and pans. - And door handles.
310
- And flushing devices and more.
311
- Dishwashing Devices: Interesting!
312
- Toilet flushes are interesting. - Why not?
313
Are there many different types?
314
- The basics are two: thrusters and manual ones.
315
- Of course ... - Depends on the pressure of the water.
316
- Clear! - That is, if the pipe is up or down.
317
If you want, I'll show you a warehouse worker who is an expert, but he's in Queens.
318
- He knows his job well.
319
- Do you think about punishing Zachary?
320
- I do not feel well. - What do you hear?
321
- You're pale. It is white as a sheet.
322
- I feel nauseous. - It takes Reglan.
323
- No, now go. - It's a Coca-Cola.
324
And hot.
325
- And hot. - Thank you. Is it safe?
326
- In small pits. - Coca-Cola was not in the fridge.
327
Call me right away.
328
- Does Coca-Cola work? Is not it more suitable for diarrhea? - Not only. Better?
329
I'd say so. Mrs. Longstreet ...
330
If we decided to scold our son ... we would like to do it in our own way, in the most appropriate way for us.
331
- We would miss it! - As?
332
- They are free to do as they believe.
333
- I do not agree. - On what?!
334
- I'm not free. In what sense, please? Keep on ... Sorry. SÃƒÂ¬? Perfect.
335
Yeah, but do not forget that there are no tests and secrecy.
336
Do not bullshit.
337
If we're wrong, Walter will end up with his ass on the floor and we'll be with him.
338
All right with this phone, Alan! You're here with us, cow cow!
339
Call me and read it.
340
Are you crazy? You started shouting like a hen. Dennis heard.
341
Good! I'm tired of that shit shit. Always, day and night!
342
You should thank me. I've made an effort to come here.
343
- Really? - I'm about to vomit. - I do not believe it.
344
- But sÃƒÂ¬. - Do you want to go to the bathroom?
345
- No one obliges you to stay. Exactly: It is not obligatory!
346
- It turns everything. - Look at a fixed point ...
347
- You see a part of the "L" line. - Go away! Leave me alone!
348
- Should not you go to the bathroom? - Go to the bathroom, if you have to vomit.
349
- From the Reglan. - Will it be sweet?
350
- No, I did yesterday. - Do not touch me!
351
- Calm down. - Do not take it for nothing.
352
For my husband, it is up to me to take care of home, school and garden! - It's not so.
353
- That's right, and I understand why it's so boring and deadly!
354
If it is dead, why do children do it?
355
Perhaps Zachary perceives your disinterest.
356
- But what disinterestedness ?! - She just said that.
357
Get a bucket!
358
Stupid bitch!
359
- You had to go to the bathroom, "Doodle" ... - She made her with her.
360
- Thing? - It was not my cake.
361
- Of course not, it's a nervous fact.
362
- If you like, I'll show you the bathroom.
363
Oh ... My Kokoschka!
364
- From the Reglan! - Now he can not keep anything inside.
365
Where's the bath?
366
I'll take you.
367
It's just nerves.
368
Thank you.
369
We can not dominate something that dominates us.
370
I always clench my neck.
371
Here it is. How do you do with the Kokoschka? Clean it, maybe with lioform.
372
The problem is to dry it. - Clean it with water and spray the colony.
373
- Colony ?! - There is my Kouros, which I never use. Pages will burst.
374
We dry them, then we crush them with books ... ... or we squeeze them out, as they do with the dollars.
375
-Oh God. - I'll get it another.
376
- It's unobtainable for years.
377
- I'm very sorry. - I'll save him. Let me do it.
378
It is the reprint of a catalog of an exhibition in London in London.
379
Get the phon and the colony, it's in the bathroom.
380
- Her husband is in the bathroom. - But it's not the crap!
381
I took it off almost everything, there was only a bit left over Dolgani.
382
Excuse me?
383
- Do you feel better? -SÃƒÂ¬.
384
- Where do I spray it? - Where's the phon?
385
- She's drying her pants.
386
- So let's wait for Kouros to come to an end. - Okay.
387
- Can I go to the bathroom too? - Yeah, of course ... of course.
388
I do not know what to say.
389
You have to excuse me.
390
- When you finished wearing the phon, please. - I'm mortified.
391
God!
392
Unbelievable! What balls! Unbelievable ...
393
- That cake was bad. - You're ingested like a pig.
394
You know my days, I have to send something to some point.
395
Oh shit! Oddio ... A real nightmare!
396
- That must be careful, it has exceeded the limit. - She's awful.
397
- Less! - It's so false.
398
- He'll give me a lot of annoyance. - They're unbearable.
399
Why are you always on their side? Sorry.
400
I'm not on their side!
401
But what the hell do we do here?
402
- Is that a joke ?! - Why are you always discussing with her?
403
We'd be gone if I did not get it all over.
404
Should I make the "sheep" like her husband?
405
- You say it was that cake? - It's safe.
406
A bit of hot Coca-Cola and ... "bang"!
407
What sucks ...
408
- Temporeggi, try to be conciliatory. - It's not true.
409
Yeah, well, you said you were a cape ... and they can do what they want with their son, even if it's a danger.
410
When a kid is a public danger, it's all about everyone.
411
It's incredible! That vomited on all my books!
412
Usually, if one feels he is vomiting, he runs into the bathroom!
413
Oh ... the Fujita! It's a disgusting thing.
414
I was about to break through the flush story.
415
- You were magnificent. - I defended myself well, did not I?
416
- Magnificent! - "In Queens" ... A genius shot.
417
- What a shit shit! - What's her name? - "Doodle". - Yeah, it's true! "Doodle" ... - "Doodle"! - Yeah, I call it "Doodle."
418
Excuse me ... We did not want to offend, really.
419
It is that the names that couples do give us always laugh.
420
We, Michael, call us a lot worse, right?
421
- Here's the phon. - Thank you.
422
- We call it "Darjeeling". - SÃƒÂ¬. - Like the tÃƒÂ¨.
423
Yeah ... That's a lot more ridiculous, I think.
424
- How's your wife? Do you feel better? - Yeah, better.
425
- I ... I reacted badly and I'm ashamed. - Give me.
426
I do not know why I did so long for the catalog.
427
It is that one attaches to these objects without knowing why.
428
- Pull the cover well. - And you keep the sheet well. - SÃƒÂ¬. - It's good, there are some creases. - The corners are still wet. - Now I fix them. - So you get rid of it. - He's right. - Okay. - It's dry. Just. -Ok. Put the colony on them, I finish this.
429
- "Doodle" where does it come from? - Sorry.
430
From "Yankee Doodle" or from cheese?
431
From a Bulli and Pupe song that makes "Doodle-loodle-loodle" ...
432
Yeah, I know her!
433
SÃ ... Ours comes from honeymoon in India.
434
They called us "Darjeeling" instead of "darling". What stupid thing!
435
- I'm going to see how it is. -So, go to her, "Darjeeling." - SÃƒÂ¬.
436
Oh, Nancy, here it is. I began to worry. Do you feel better?
437
- Yeah, better, I guess. - If you're not sure, stay away from the table.
438
I put the towel in the tub, I did not know where to put it.
439
Perfect.
440
- You've got it! I'm so sorry. - It's all right.
441
I'm sorry if I did not care about her, I was only taken by the Kokoschka.
442
- Do not worry. - I ... I was wrong. Please!
443
First, in the bathroom ... I was thinking ...
444
SÃƒÂ¬?
445
Maybe we did not consider one ...
446
- Well, well ... - What? What's that?
447
Well ... Apostrophing with insults is a kind of aggression.
448
- Sure. - It depends! - Of course ... it depends.
449
Zachary has never been violent, must have had his reasons.
450
How to be called "spy". Excuse me ...
451
SÃƒÂ¬, Walter?
452
There must not be a patient among the present.
453
Deny, deny! If necessary, we cause the "Journal" cause.
454
I send you the draft press release by e-mail. I must leave.
455
If anyone tells me the spy, I react.
456
Unless it's true. - Thing?
457
- That's it.
458
- Do you think my son is a spy? - But no, I was joking!
459
- Anyway, it's yours too. - How would that be?
460
- He said it was Zachary. - We forced him.
461
- We are not on the right track. - Anyway, he did the spy.
462
- Nancy? - Thing?! Do you think my son ... is it a spy?
463
- I do not believe anything. - Then do not say anything, do not insinuate.
464
There is no need to become nervous.
465
Me and Michael are striving to be impartial and conciliatory.
466
- Not so much impartial. - Really?
467
- Apparently impartial. - "Doodle," I have to go.
468
- And then go away, coward.
469
- I'm risking losing the most important customer I have.
470
So this endless shit ...
471
- My son has lost two incisors! - There's news coming.
472
- One, irrevocably. - They'll put others, better!
473
They did not break the timpani.
474
The error is not the source of the problem.
475
An 11-year-old boy beat another with a stick!
476
- Armed with a stick. - We took it off.
477
- Because we've asked you. We did not oppose it.
478
It is a term that indicates a clear premeditation and excludes the mistake ...
479
.. and the infancy of childhood.
480
- I can not tolerate this tone. - Between us there has never been feeling.
481
Mr. Cowan ... it's incredibly frustrating ... ..have heard of a mistake already admitted.
482
The term "armed" was unsuitable and was taken away! Well, in a lazy way, it was soaring.
483
Zachary reacted to an insult: if they attack me, I'm defending myself ... ... especially if I'm alone against an entire band!
484
- Since he has been vomited, he is tricked. - Does he realize his vulgarity?
485
We are all right people, I do not know why we've lost the brackets.
486
- It's useless. - Michael, just do it!
487
If we are apparently impartial, it is worth noting that it is not at all.
488
No, I do not like the china on which the two bastards brought us.
489
- Let's see Pen not see her like you. - Penelope! - Sorry.
490
So, Ethan is a sting ?! This is really scandalous.
491
- Now, I just have to go really. - Yeah, I too.
492
Go! I surrender.
493
Ready?
494
Hello Mom. No, there are friends, but tell me.
495
Yeah, do whatever the doctor tells you.
496
SÃƒÂ¬.
497
The "thing"?
498
Antril ?! You ... are you taking Antril? A second, mom!
499
That shit is called Antril?
500
My mother also takes it. Like thousands of other people.
501
Mom, you have to stop taking it now.
502
You now ... you have to do as I say, then I'll explain.
503
Mom, you have to tell the doctor I told you not to take it.
504
Good.
505
Why are you red? Who sees you?
506
Mom, it's ridiculous! Mum mum!
507
Mom ... There are people here.
508
Ok. I love you. Hello.
509
The crutches are red ... ... so that they do not get hit by trucks in the event of night walks.
510
They give you Antril for pressure.
511
If you have no side effects, I quote as a witness.
512
- Did not I have a scarf? - His indifference is annoying.
513
If my mother had any symptoms, I would promote a class action.
514
- There will still be one. - I hope.
515
It's stupid to be honest, you weaken, you lower your guard.
516
Come on, Nancy. We have heard enough of sermons for today.
517
Go, but I want to tell you something: ... ... that I know you, I'm not surprised that ...
518
What's your name? I'm not surprised that Zacary has behavioral problems.
519
- When you killed that little hamster ... - Killed ?!
520
Did I kill the hamster?
521
Yeah, try to make us feel guilty, do the morality paladins, ... ..when she, on the other hand, is a murderer!
522
- I did not kill the hamster. - Worse! He abandoned him trembling fear in a hostile environment. - It will be eaten by a dog or a rat!
523
-This is true. -Thing? - It's horrible what's going to happen to him. I thought he would be happy to go back to the sewers. - No, no! - He abandoned him out!
524
I can not touch anybody in that family. Pen, you know that! - She's afraid of rodents. - Yeah, I'm afraid of rodents.
525
And also of snakes and everything that sticks to the ground. - And why did not she go down looking for her? - Because I did not know.
526
She said this morning, so I went down, I went to the palace ... ... they went to the cellar too!
527
I find it intolerable to be put on the bench of the defendants ... ... for the history of the hamster involved in the family.
528
It's just us, it does not have to do with this situation ... ... and I do not admit that I get the assassin in my house.
529
- What's wrong with your house? - It's my home! I open the door! In fact, the sanctuary to accommodate ... ... as people who should be grateful.
530
Continue to "caress" the ego ...
531
- So do not worry! - No! I was disgusted, I'm so glad!
532
- Michael, it's ridiculous. - Thing? Are you gone mad too?
533
Does their son stick Ethan and you break the hooks for a hamster?
534
- What you did to the hamster is wrong. - I do not care a fuck!
535
You will not regret when your daughter comes back.
536
I do not get it under a nine-year-old fucker!
537
Here I agree with him 100%.
538
- You see it? It's pathetic. - Careful, Penelope ... Careful!
539
I've been quiet so far, but do not let me cross the limit.
540
- And Ethan? - What does that have to do with anything? - Is he even here?
541
- He has more to think about. - He was not fond of Culetto.
542
"Culetto"! How are you going to give a name like this ?!
543
Why do not you remarry, do you have to have our son?
544
All this dialogue and justification of the fuck really stiffened me.
545
We have been kind, we bought tulips, ... I am dressed as a progressist, ... ... the truth is that I can not afford more than these bullshit goodies. - I'm a fucking son of a bitch! - We're all here.
546
- No, not all are hysterical bitches. - Not her, it's obvious.
547
- No, no, thanks to God! - No ... "Darjeeling", not you!
548
You never lose control!
549
- Why are you so aggressive with me? - I'm sincere!
550
- You're aggressive. - You trapped me in this "carnival"!
551
- Should I trap you? - SÃƒÂ¬! - What a disgusting thing!
552
You are to preach that you have to be civil, and for me it's okay.
553
Of course, I'm going to preach it. Someone has to do it!
554
Do you think it would be better to be a hysterical son of a bitch?
555
- No one has said it, no one has criticized it. - Oh yeah!
556
- Do not say so. - Should I cause you cause?
557
Was it better to destroy you from the insurance company?
558
- Stop it, Pen. - Thing? - You lost the sense of measure! I do not care!
559
One does everything to escape the mediocrity ... and instead he ends up humiliated and completely alone.
560
SÃƒÂ¬, Walter? Get the evidence. They have to take the tests.
561
In my opinion, given the situation, it is better not to do anything. One is born alone and dies only. Stop! Who wants scotch?
562
Walter, I'm in the meeting. I'll call you from the office. I live with a totally negative person.
563
- Who is negative? - I.
564
- It was stupid to organize this meeting.
565
- I told you so. - Really? - SÃƒÂ¬. - Did you tell me not to organize it?
566
- It did not sound like a good idea. - It was, on the other hand.
567
- No. - Who wants it? - Did you tell me it was not a good idea?
568
- If I remember ... - "If I remember well"! - Just a little bit.
569
- You did not have to leave? "Since I'm here, so much to drink.
570
Michael, look at me and tell us we did not agree to the meeting.
571
Calm, Penelope, so we do not get to anything.
572
Who said, "Do not touch the cake, do we care for the Cowans?"
573
- It was very cute. - What does that have to do with anything? - How would that be?
574
- Guests are guests. - Tell the truth! It's a liar.
575
My wife, in fact, had to drag me to bring me here.
576
When one grows with John Wayne as a model, ... his instinct does not bring him to sort things out with words.
577
- I thought the model was Ivanhoe. - One is worth the other. - They are complementary. - "They are complementary" ... How much do you want to humble yourself yet?
578
Moving it here has not served anything.
579
What did you expect, "Doodle"? What a ridiculous name!
580
New revelations on maximum systems? This scotch is incredible.
581
True? 18 years of aging. It comes from a Scottish village where they still use only their barley.
582
Who took the tulips?
583
I just said, "Sorry, we did not pick the tulips this week."
584
I did not ask you to go to dawn till Henry Street!
585
Do not take it for these things, it's not worth it.
586
The tulips he wanted him, just him!
587
And do not we drink anything? Eh?
588
Penelope and I would like a drink.
589
It's ... pretty funny, you know?
590
A fan of John Wayne and lvanhoe who is afraid of a mole!
591
Enough with this hamster. Stop it.
592
- He's right, you're funny. - And for her? - I think it's better than no.
593
- Give me a drink, Michael. - No. - Michael! - No!
594
What's up, Michael? All right! Drink! So much for me?
595
- Does alcohol hurt her, by accident? - No, it's the ideal for me!
596
I do not know...
597
- Mr. Cowan? - Alan. - Alan ...
598
You see ... between us two there is no feeling ... ... I live with one who has decided definitively ... ... that life is synonymous with mediocrity.
599
It is very hard to stay with one who lives enthralled behind this idea ... ... that he does not want to change anything and that he does not get excited at all!
600
Why do you say to him these things? You know how much he cares!
601
Everybody needs to believe in a possible ... evolution!
602
He is the last person to make these speeches.
603
I say what I want to whom I want.
604
Who the fuck is right now?
605
Hello Mom.
606
Is fine. They broke two teeth, but he's fine.
607
Yeah, they hurt him, but they'll pass.
608
I told you there are some people. I'll call you later. Hello.
609
Are they still hurt? - No.
610
- So why is it worrying about her mother? - She wants to put anxiety on her.
611
Penelope, enough! Why do you always do a tragedy for shit?
612
Penelope, we all care about ourselves.
613
We would like to believe in a possible evolution ... of which we, abandoned all forms of selfishness, ... may be the true artifacts. Like you, who writes a book on Darfur ... It's a very noble thing!
614
I understand that one says, "I take a massacre, the story is full, ..." "..and write a book to me".
615
- Everyone is saved as he can. - But I do not write this book to save me!
616
- He did not read it, he does not even know what this is all about! - It does not change.
617
My God ... The odor of Kouros will end up killing me.
618
- A fucking stench. - She took her hand. - Excuse me. - It's my fault, I splashed like a madman. But why ... can things not be simpler?
619
Why should it be all that stressful?
620
She thinks too much ... Women think too much.
621
- Original as a response. - What does it mean to "think too much"?
622
How can you continue to live without the slightest moral concept in the world?
623
- Look, I'm alive! - Michael, shut up!
624
With your painful complicity, you can get me disgusted.
625
- Where's your sense of humor? - I do not have it and I do not want it.
626
In my opinion, the couple is the worst torture God has ever inflicted on us.
627
- Oh, wonderful! - The couple and the family.
628
It is not obligatory to tell it to us and it is also uncomfortable!
629
- It's not a problem. - You agree with me, do you?
630
Just jump to pole!
631
- Alan, say something! - He has the right to have his ideas.
632
- But you do not have to boast it! - SÃƒÂ¬, maybe.
633
What do we care about their marriage?
634
We are here for the problem of children, not for their marriage.
635
- Yeah, huh ... - What?
636
- They're connected. - Of course they're connected.
637
- Are Ethan's teeth connected to our wedding?
638
- SÃƒÂ¬. - I do not follow you.
639
- Let's go back and look at our situation.
640
Your children suck your life and leave you old and off, ... ... it's a law of nature! Young men who marry have no idea what's waiting for them! Poor bastards! They are happy, before no one tells him anything.
641
A friend of my time is about to have a son.
642
I told him, "A son at our age? Are you a kid?"
643
"Maybe you'll still have 10 years before you get cancer or a heart attack ..." "and you want to have a son?"
644
- You do not really think so. - Yes, instead. - I think even worse.
645
So he's humiliating.
646
- He says? -That's a cry, Penelope! It only worsens things.
647
-SÃƒÂ¬. - Oh, but of course ...
648
- Exceptional, right? - Awesome. - Are you interested in a cigar?
649
- No cigars in this house! - What a pity.
650
Did you want to smoke a cigar?
651
I do what I want and if I get a cigar, I smoke it.
652
I do not mind not to be sorry for Penelope, which is already quite tense, ... ..wanna be good!
653
The stopping to whimper, Nancy is right.
654
See women crying sends men to the beast.
655
In addition, Michael's thinking, for me, is fully shared.
656
SÃƒÂ¬? Yes, of course, go.
657
- Type "New York" and specify the time and day. - Unbearable.
658
Specifies the time and day on which it is shipped.
659
Do not "examine", it's too sloppy, better "disapproves".
660
- It's always like this, day and night. - A second.
661
- Our life is marked by that cell phone. - It's important.
662
It's always so: what's happening elsewhere is always more important.
663
Not "strategy", "maneuver". A maneuver that emerges in two weeks from the shareholders' meeting ... By the way, at the table ... everywhere.
664
"An inquiry" in quotation marks. Put it in quotation marks.
665
I do not even protest anymore. Unconditional yield!
666
- Maybe I'm still vomiting. - Where's the bucket? - I do not know!
667
Then, quote my words.
668
- It's close to the bucket, please. - Pen! - What's up? I've set everything up, this time.
669
"Stabilize my client, as the lawyer of TW Pharma says." At Reuters, in newspapers, in specialized journals. Atutti.
670
- What do you have? - It's about to vomit.
671
- Your interest touches me. - I'm worried.
672
- I did not understand it ...
673
Come on, Nancy, please, we can not do that ...
674
Their marriage has now "gone", we do not compete.
675
Who gives you the right to say that our marriage is "gone"?
676
SÃƒÂ¬, Walter? Yeah, I've just read it.
677
You'll see that she's coming to you now. To manipulate the stock price. Look, Walter, I'll call you. - I did not tell him, Steve said.
678
-Michael! - Michael, excuse me. - I do not let her judge.
679
- Then you do not judge our son. He beat Ethan.
680
They're young! When they play, the kids have been kidding, ever since! - It's a rule of life. - It's not true. - Yes, instead.
681
It takes some maturity to replace the right to violence.
682
Originally the right, as you will know, was brute force!
683
- Speaking of prehistory, but not today. - What do we mean today?
684
She is heavy, like this whole conversation.
685
Penelope, my belief is the god of the massacre ... ... the god who rules indisputably from the night of the times.
686
She is interested in Africa, right?
687
- What happens? - Do not worry.
688
- Nancy? - I'm fine. - Okay ...
689
I have just returned from Congo. I've seen eight-year-old children trained to kill ... ... who also kill hundreds of people ... with the machetes, the miter, the kalash ... with the Thumper!
690
So if my son breaks a pair of teeth to a kid ... with a bamboo cane in public gardens, ... I can not get angry with her.
691
- You should! - Thumper! - That's what the gangsters call.
692
- They call it so. How are you? - Very well!
693
- What did she take? - It is, it's nothing.
694
You can not speak to Africa, I know the suffering of Africa!
695
- I do not doubt it. - I do not think of anything else for months.
696
Avoid touching this subject, please.
697
- It's getting me nice! - Shut up!
698
It fights for peace and to maintain the balance of the world. Close that fucking mouth!
699
- Do you still want to? - More than safe. It can not do me well.
700
This is New York City, we are not ... Kinshasa!
701
We live according to the laws of the western society ... ... so what happens at the Brooklyn Bridge Park ... ... it is the values ​​of the West ... ... which, by the way, I'm lucky and I'm proud to belong.
702
- Puppy your husband must be one of those values.
703
- Watch out! It's thrown on her like a murderous fury!
704
My heart would loose.
705
- He's fucking her! I can not believe it. - What does it matter to him?
706
No, really, morality forces you to dominate your own impulses, ... ..there are moments when we do not want to do it.
707
Why should not I say Ave Maria having sex?
708
- Is this scotch here? - No I do not think so.
709
"Thumper"!
710
- "Thumper", it's true! - SÃƒÂ¬. - It's called so.
711
Why do not you just say "launches"?
712
It is called so-called "kalash" and not "kalashnikov" or "AK-47".
713
-Who says that? - Now, Nancy.
714
It is clear that for a successful man like my husband, ... it is difficult to be concerned with the problems of the mortal ones.
715
- That's right! - I do not understand...
716
I do not understand why today, in the global age, ... ... you can not have a bit of sense of participation.
717
Oh, Penelope, save these boring mummies!
718
- Now I'm gonna kill him! - SÃƒÂ¬?
719
- He is right, after a while he can not stand.
720
"A veiled attempt to ...". Here, so!
721
Did he have any problems with the rest? Good.
722
What were we saying? Thumper ...
723
We were saying that, despite my husband's ideas ... ... things do not concern more than one single country ... ... but I'm concerned with the citizens of the world. "the citizens of the world" ... SÃƒÂ¬.
724
Nancy, it's absurd to drink in your conditions.
725
What conditions? I 'm very good.
726
It's an interesting idea ... Yeah?
727
No, no interviews before the announcement.
728
Mr. Cowan, could you end this dreary conversation?
729
Remember that the shareholders do not give a fuck. Shareholders ...
730
Nancy, what are you doing? Are you crazy?
731
Here! - Fuck! - OMG! - So do it! Ah-ha! Here it is.
732
- It takes the phon! - You're asylum, dear!
733
I got it all there, inside! It's all right there! I just bought it and I took hours to configure it.
734
I do not understand ... It was a gesture irresponsible.
735
All my life ... is there!
736
You have to remove the sim card and the battery. How do you do it?
737
- I just bought it ... I do not know! - Let me see. - It's locked. - Look at them as they laugh! Penelope, look at them ... Penelope, stop laughing!
738
My husband spent the afternoon drying anything. No, this ... - Leave it, it's gone. - You have to wait. - He has gone!
739
- Do you want to use the phone? - No. Well, I have to say ...
740
Thing? Thing? What do you have to say, Michael?
741
No, I have nothing to say.
742
I say it's a lot better as well. It's so much better, do not you think so?
743
Men affection to their play, ... ... even if it makes him lose credibility. I was with one ... ... when I saw it with a rectangular purse with the shoulder strap, ... ... a man's handbag but with the shoulder strap ... it's over!
744
The bag with the shoulder strap is terrible, ... ... having the phone in hand is still worse.
745
Men should have both hands free, they must have them free!
746
John Wayne is also my man's idea.
747
He wore a Colt 45 that made the vacuum around.
748
A man who does not emit vibrations from the gloomy ... ... it's as if it were devoid of consistency.
749
So ... Michael, we'll be happy now!
750
This goodwill, as she said, is going to whores, ... ... I have the feeling that it is almost enjoyable.
751
That's my opinion. My opinion is that unfortunately some people do not hold alcohol well.
752
- They're more than lucid. - Of course!
753
I begin to see things with a pleasant serenity.
754
Good this: "A pleasant serenity."
755
I do not understand why you're drunk in front of aliens, "Darjeeling."
756
- Shut up! - Alan, please, relax.
757
No cigars in the house! There's Hoyo de Monterrey, Partagas D number 4, ... and there's the Hoyo Coronation!
758
- Where did you find them? - Better not tell her. - Forward! Hispanic contacts: One of my suppliers is with a hostess ... ..that brings two boxes a week.
759
You can not smoke at the home of an asthmatic child. Why do you tell your facts?
760
- Who has asthma? - Our son. - But we had the hamster!
761
Yes, you should not keep animals when you have asthma.
762
- No, it's not advisable. - Even red fish are not advised.
763
I have to fuck all these bullshit!
764
Maybe I'm the only one to not see things "with a nice serenity"!
765
The truth is that this is the happiest day of my life.
766
Are you drunk unhappy!
767
Michael, every word that comes out of your mouth kills me.
768
I'm not drunk, I drank a couple of scum of that scotch wretched ... ..will pull you out like the eighth wonder of the world!
769
I'm not drunk, but believe me ... I'd drown every misery into a good spiral.
770
My husband is also unhappy.
771
He got tired of it as if he had been abandoned on the roadside.
772
(Nancy) I think that even for him is the most unhappy day of his life.
773
- Lo Ã¨. - I'm sorry, Doodle.
774
Ready?
775
Ah ... Ready?
776
Mom! I told you we have guests! Have you forgotten it?
777
Because it's a bad drug, it's a poison.
778
No, Mom, here is a person who can explain it to you.
779
- Tell her. - Thing?
780
The one who knows about that fucking poison.
781
What do you want her to say? He does not know anything!
782
Good morning how are you lady?
783
Oh ... Yeah, what symptoms do you have?
784
Yes, but the operation will solve everything.
785
Uh, the other leg, huh?
786
No, I'm not an orthopedist. Now he calls me "doctor"!
787
"Doctor" ... It's ridiculous! Come on, put it on.
788
Yeah ... you lose balance, mister?
789
SÃƒÂ¬ ... No! Of course not! Kill her ... Do not give gossip.
790
Anyway, it might be a good idea to hang it up for a while ... ... until it's completely cured.
791
- Yeah, I hear it. It seems to me in great shape. - Come on! Did you understand? Stop taking that medicine.
792
Do what I tell you. I got it? A kiss.
793
I can not stand it anymore. They're just breaks of balls.
794
So let's go back to our problem.
795
We should decide what to do with Zach tonight.
796
Or maybe, we think, "Who cares?" We came here for this, no?
797
Now I'm about to vomit. Where's the bucket?
798
Stop it now. I just said enough!
799
They both did wrong. SÃƒÂ¬! That's right, they both made a mistake.
800
- Are you serious? - How, please?
801
- Are you serious? - I say seriously, yes!
802
Ethan, to whom I gave two Codeine at three o'clock at night, was wrong ?!
803
It is not said that this is not the reality.
804
Get out of my house right away. Out of the whip! Outside, fuck!
805
My bag! My bag! Alan! But am I crazy?
806
- Alan, you have to intervene! - "Alan, you have to intervene"!
807
Close that mouthpiece! It broke the mirror and the perfume.
808
Alan, why do not you defend me?
809
- It's time to go. - In the end I'm not strangulating it!
810
But what did I do to them?
811
They did not do both wrong: victims and executioners are not the same!
812
- A "carnivore"? - Fuck, Penelope, just with these nasty fucks!
813
- But why do I claim it? - Yeah, you "claim"!
814
Your cook for those Sudanese Negroes now carry it on everything.
815
Astounding! What do you have? Why are you acting miserable?
816
Because I feel it. I want to be miserable!
817
When you realize that horrors are done in that part of the world, ... you will bitterly regret your obscene nihilism, miserable!
818
Yeah, "Darjeeling", you're the best in the world, ... ..you are the most beautiful, the best! Yeah, you got it! You understand!
819
I would say it's time to go. These two are monsters.
820
- Well, Nancy. - No. No! I want to keep drinking. I want to fall drunk drenched.
821
That bastard pulled my bag and nobody moved a finger ...
822
- I want to fall drunk. - That's enough.
823
And you let her even say our son is an executioner!
824
We come here to clarify things, instead they insult us, ... they abuse us, they teach us how to be citizens of the world!
825
I am proud to have a son who has beaten your son ... ... and I clean my ass with his human dick rights!
826
Wow! With two glasses, here it is ... His true nature comes out!
827
Where is that sweet and reserved woman finished?
828
- I told you! - What did he say to him?
829
That she was false! Only false! I'm sorry.
830
- And when did you tell him? - While she was drying in the bathroom.
831
She knew her for a few minutes and she knew she was false?
832
- It does not take long for me to understand it. - That's it. - I feel it in the skin.
833
- What do you mean by "false"? - Why do I have to listen to you, Alan?
834
Relax, Nancy.
835
It's a fake. It does not matter to you, as well as to her!
836
- True. - Yeah, it's true. - Well, he said it was true.
837
It does not matter a fuck. It was so obvious right away!
838
- And it's the same for her. - But do you care?
839
- What - Let's talk about it. Tell me what it really matters to him. Do you know that she is more credible when it behaves miserable?
840
In truth, we all shake it off, maybe Penelope, which, I recognize, is the only coherent one.
841
I do not want her to be recognized. I do not want it!
842
But I really want to, really ...
843
Yeah, "Doodle," we're interested in, but messy. We are not the champions of the civil rights movement.
844
I saw her friend Jane Fonda on TV the other day.
845
I almost did not post a Ku Klux Klan poster!
846
Is my friend Jane Fonda ?! But I care! What does it mean?
847
You are very similar, you are part of the same kind: ... ... committed to resolving everything.
848
Those women do not like, ... we prefer sensuality, madness, hormonal storms.
849
Those who want to show off their intuitive ability ... ... make us want to pass.
850
- Even to him, to his poor husband, he passes the urge. - Do not talk to me.
851
She does not care a fuck about what she likes women!
852
Why do you "vomit" opinions?
853
If there is one whose opinion does not matter a fuck, it's her!
854
How to fuck ... Like a negro on a slave ship.
855
Because, she has not just screamed ... ... that your stunts did well to beat ours?
856
Yeah, he did fine. Our son is not a small cacasotto. Yours is a fucking spy!
857
It's time to go, Alan. Why are we still in this house?
858
Here's what I think of your stupid tulips, your horrendous flowers!
859
Also for me is the happiest day of my life.
