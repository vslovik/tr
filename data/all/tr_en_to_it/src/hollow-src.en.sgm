<seg id="1"> Help here! Lend a hand here! Anyone! </seg>
<seg id="2"> Constable Crane? Ichabod Crane, is that you? </seg>
<seg id="3"> None other. Not only me. </seg>
<seg id="4"> I have found something, which was lately a man. </seg>
<seg id="5"> - Burn it. - Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Just a moment, if I may. We do not yet know the cause of death. </seg>
<seg id="7"> When you find them in the river, cause of death is drowning. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Possibly so, if there is water in the lungs, but by pathology we might be able to determine whether or not he was dead before he went into the river. </seg>
<seg id="9"> I will need to examine the body. Cut him up. Are we heathens? </seg>
<seg id="10"> What happened to him? Nothing, sir. Arrested for burglary. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Good work. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The millennium is almost upon us. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In a few months, we will be living in the 19th century, yet our courts continue to rely on medieval devices of torture. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Stand down! I stand up for sense and justice. Our jails overflow with men and women convicted on confessions worth no more than this one. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Constable Crane! </seg>
<seg id="16"> This is a song that we have heard from you more than once. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Now, there are two courses open to me. </seg>
<seg id="18"> First, I can let you cool your heels in the cells until you learn respect for the dignity of my office. </seg>
<seg id="19"> I beg pardon. But why am I the only one who sees that, to solve crimes, to detect the guilty, we must use our brains to recognize vital clues, using up-to-date scientific techniques? </seg>
<seg id="20"> Which brings me to the second course. There is a town upstate, two days' journey to the north in the Hudson Highlands. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It is a place called Sleepy Hollow. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Have you heard of it? I have not. </seg>
<seg id="23"> An isolated farming community, mainly Dutch. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Three persons have been murdered there, all within a fortnight. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Each one found with the head lopped off. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Lopped off? Clean as dandelion heads, apparently. </seg>
<seg id="27"> You will take these experimentations of yours to Sleepy Hollow and there you will detect the murderer. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Bring him here to face our good justice. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Will you do this? I shall. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Remember, it is you, Ichabod Crane, who is now put to the test. </seg>
<seg id="31"> "The Pickety Witch, the Pickety Witch </seg>
<seg id="32"> "Who's got a kiss for the Pickety Witch? </seg>
<seg id="33"> "The Pickety Witch, the Pickety Witch "Who's got a kiss for the Pickety Witch?" </seg>
<seg id="34"> Is it Theodore? No, pardon, miss. I am only a stranger. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Then have a kiss on account. </seg>
<seg id="36"> I'm looking for Baltus Van Tassel. </seg>
<seg id="37"> I'm his daughter, Katrina Van Tassel. </seg>
<seg id="38"> And who are you, friend? We have not heard your name yet. I've not said it. Excuse me. </seg>
<seg id="39"> You need some manners. We'll have no raised voices. </seg>
<seg id="40"> It is only to raise spirits during this dark time that I and my dear wife are giving this little party. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Young sir, you are most welcome, even if you are selling something. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Thank you, sir. I am Constable Ichabod Crane, sent to you from New York to investigate murder in Sleepy Hollow. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Then Sleepy Hollow is grateful to you, Constable Crane. </seg>
<seg id="44"> And we hope you will honor us by remaining in this house. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Well spoke, dear. Come, sir, we'll get you settled. Play on! </seg>
<seg id="46"> Excuse me, please. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Thank you. Please tell Mr. Van Tassel I will be down in a moment. </seg>
<seg id="48"> I will, sir. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Thank God you're here. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Excellent. Come in. Leave us, my dear. </seg>
<seg id="51"> We are joined by Dr. Thomas Lancaster, Reverend Steenwyck, our able Magistrate Samuel Philipse, and lastly, this fine fellow is James Hardenbrook, our notary. </seg>
<seg id="52"> And you, sir? </seg>
<seg id="53"> A simple farmer who has prospered. </seg>
<seg id="54"> The town looks to me as friend and counsel. </seg>
<seg id="55"> And landlord and banker. Can we proceed? </seg>
<seg id="56"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="57"> So... Three persons murdered. </seg>
<seg id="58"> First, Peter Van Garrett and his son, Dirk Van Garrett. Both of them strong, capable men, found together decapitated. </seg>
<seg id="59"> One week later, the Widow Winship. Also decapitated. </seg>
<seg id="60"> Now, I will need to ask you many questions. </seg>
<seg id="61"> But first, let me ask, is anyone suspected? </seg>
<seg id="62"> How much have your superiors explained to you, Constable? </seg>
<seg id="63"> Only that the three were slain in open ground, </seg>
<seg id="64"> their heads found severed from their bodies. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Their heads were not found at all. </seg>
<seg id="66"> The heads are gone? </seg>
<seg id="67"> Taken. Taken by the Headless Horseman. Taken back to hell. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Pardon, I don't... Perhaps you had better sit down. </seg>
<seg id="69"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="70"> The horseman was a Hessian mercenary sent to these shores by German princes to keep Americans under the yoke of England. </seg>
<seg id="71"> But unlike his compatriots, who came for money, the horseman came for love of carnage. </seg>
<seg id="72"> When battle was joined, there you'd find him. </seg>
<seg id="73"> He rode a giant black steed named Daredevil. </seg>
<seg id="74"> He was infamous for riding his horse hard into battle, chopping off heads at full gallop. </seg>
<seg id="75"> He had filed his teeth down to sharp points to add to the ferocity of his appearance. </seg>
<seg id="76"> This butcher didn't finally reach his end until the winter of '79 not far from here in our Western Woods. </seg>
<seg id="77"> They chopped off his head with his own sword. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Even today, the Western Woods is a haunted place where brave men will not venture. </seg>
<seg id="79"> For what was planted in the ground that day was a seed of evil. </seg>
<seg id="80"> And so it has been for 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="81"> But now the Hessian wakes. He's on the rampage, cutting off heads where he finds them. </seg>
<seg id="82"> Are you saying... Is that what you believe? </seg>
<seg id="83"> Seeing is believing. </seg>
<seg id="84"> They tell me that you've brought books and trappings of scientific investigation. </seg>
<seg id="85"> This is the only book I recommend you read. </seg>
<seg id="86"> I see. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Reverend Steenwyck. Gentlemen. Murder needs no ghosts to come from the grave. </seg>
<seg id="88"> We have murders in New York without benefit of ghouls and goblins. </seg>
<seg id="89"> You're a long way from New York, Constable. </seg>
<seg id="90"> The assassin is a man of flesh and blood and I will discover him. </seg>
<seg id="91"> Come out, devil. </seg>
<seg id="92"> His name's Gunpowder. He should do just fine, Mr. Killian. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Thank you. Good luck, sir. If you need help, you call my name. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Much appreciated. </seg>
<seg id="95"> Now, don't you worry about a thing. Everything's going to be just fine. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Thomas! Inside! </seg>
<seg id="97"> Run along for your breakfast. Kiss your mother once for you and twice for me. </seg>
<seg id="98"> Murder! The horseman's killed again! </seg>
<seg id="99"> All right, Gunpowder, we're off. Come on. </seg>
<seg id="100"> No, no. Come on, the other way. No, no. Turn around. </seg>
<seg id="101"> Good horsy. </seg>
<seg id="102"> - Mr. Miller, ride back for the coffin cart. - Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="103"> The rest of you keep a sharp lookout. </seg>
<seg id="104"> It's all right. I'm here now. </seg>
<seg id="105"> The fourth victim, Jonathan Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="106"> I see. </seg>
<seg id="107"> And the head? </seg>
<seg id="108"> Taken. </seg>
<seg id="109"> Interesting. Very interesting. What is? </seg>
<seg id="110"> In headless-corpse cases of this sort, the head is removed to prevent identification of the body. </seg>
<seg id="111"> But we know this was Jonathan Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="112"> Precisely. So why was the head removed? </seg>
<seg id="113"> - Why? - Right. </seg>
<seg id="114"> - You have moved the body? - I did. </seg>
<seg id="115"> - You must never move the body! - Why not? </seg>
<seg id="116"> Because. </seg>
<seg id="117"> The stride is gigantic. </seg>
<seg id="118"> The attacker rode Masbath down, turned his horse, came back. Came back to claim the head. </seg>
<seg id="119"> Yes. There's a chemical reaction. </seg>
<seg id="120"> It shows there was a powerful, singular thrust to the neck. </seg>
<seg id="121"> - Interesting. - What is it? </seg>
<seg id="122"> The wound was cauterized in the very instant, as though the blade itself were red hot. And yet, no blistering, no scorched flesh. The Devil's fire. </seg>
<seg id="123"> "Be vigilant," as it sayeth in the Book of Peter, chapter five, verse eight. "Because your adversary the devil, "as a roaring lion, walketh about, "seeking whom he may devour." </seg>
<seg id="124"> God rest Jonathan Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="125"> Amen. Mr. Constable, sir. You're young Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="126"> I was young Masbath, but now the only one. </seg>
<seg id="127"> Masbath, at your service. In honor bound to avenge my father. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Well, one and only Masbath, I thank you very much, but your mother will need you more than I. </seg>
<seg id="129"> My mother is in heaven, sir. </seg>
<seg id="130"> She has my father now to care for her. But you have no one to serve you. I am your man, sir. Yes, and a brave one, too. But I cannot be the one to look after you. </seg>
<seg id="131"> I'm sorry for your loss, young Mr. Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="132"> - Constable Crane. - Mr. Philipse? </seg>
<seg id="133"> Something you should know. </seg>
<seg id="134"> Jonathan Masbath was not the fourth victim, - but the fifth. - The fifth? Aye. Five victims in four graves. </seg>
<seg id="135"> Young Masbath. Find a place in the Van Tassel's servants' quarters. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Wake me before dawn. I hope you have a strong stomach. </seg>
<seg id="137"> Peter Van Garrett. Dirk Van Garrett. </seg>
<seg id="138"> Jonathan Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="139"> There are five victims, four graves. </seg>
<seg id="140"> The Widow Winship. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Bring the Widow in. </seg>
<seg id="142"> This is most irregular, Constable. I should hope so, Doctor, but in this case, necessary. </seg>
<seg id="143"> We need to operate immediately. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Operate? She's dead. </seg>
<seg id="145"> When we say "operate," we mean, of course, I will need the operating table. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Once more, the neck wound cauterized. </seg>
<seg id="147"> The sword thrust to the stomach, the same. </seg>
<seg id="148"> But to what purpose? </seg>
<seg id="149"> To what is your purpose is the question. </seg>
<seg id="150"> What manner of instruments are these? Some of my own design. </seg>
<seg id="151"> All right, then. Step outside, young Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Thank you very, very much for your help, Mr. Killian. And if you don't mind, Doctor, my concentration suffers greatly when I'm observed. </seg>
<seg id="153"> I am finished. What in the name of God have you done to her? </seg>
<seg id="154"> We are dealing with a madman. </seg>
<seg id="155"> What did you find out, Constable? </seg>
<seg id="156"> The Widow Winship was with child. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Who's there? </seg>
<seg id="158"> Oh, pardon my intrusion. It is no intrusion. </seg>
<seg id="159"> I come here to read when I am wakeful. </seg>
<seg id="160"> To read books which you must hide? They were my mother's books. My father believes tales of romance caused the brain fever that killed my mother. </seg>
<seg id="161"> She died two years ago come midwinter. </seg>
<seg id="162"> The nurse who cared for her during her sickness is now Lady Van Tassel. </seg>
<seg id="163"> There was something else, too. Why did no one think to mention that the Van Garretts are kith and kin to the Van Tassels? </seg>
<seg id="164"> Why, because there is hardly a household in Sleepy Hollow that is not connected to every other by blood or marriage. </seg>
<seg id="165"> I see. </seg>
<seg id="166"> This land we're looking at was Van Garrett land, given to my father when I was in swaddling clothes. The Van Garretts were the richest family around these parts. </seg>
<seg id="167"> When my father brought us to Sleepy Hollow, Van Garrett set him up with an acre and a broken-down cottage. My father worked hard for his family, and prospered and built this house. And I owe my happiness to him. </seg>
<seg id="168"> I remember living poor in the cottage. </seg>
<seg id="169"> Should I show you? Yes. </seg>
<seg id="170"> Take this. It is my gift for you. </seg>
<seg id="171"> No, I have no use for it. Are you so certain of everything? </seg>
<seg id="172"> It was your mother's. Keep it close to your heart. It is sure protection against harm. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Are you so certain of everything? </seg>
<seg id="174"> These are strange. These markings, what are they? I've had them since I can remember. </seg>
<seg id="175"> I used to play by this hearth as a child. </seg>
<seg id="176"> It was my first drawing school, and my mother was my teacher. </seg>
<seg id="177"> Oh, look. See? Carved into the fire back? The archer. I'd forgotten it. </seg>
<seg id="178"> This was from long before we lived here. </seg>
<seg id="179"> - Are you all right? - Yes, thank you. </seg>
<seg id="180"> A cardinal. My favorite. </seg>
<seg id="181"> I'd love to have a tame one, but I wouldn't have the heart to cage him. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Well, then I have something for you. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Cardinal on one side. An empty cage. </seg>
<seg id="184"> And now... </seg>
<seg id="185"> You can do magic. Teach me. </seg>
<seg id="186"> It is no magic. It is what we call optics. Separate pictures which become one in the spinning. </seg>
<seg id="187"> It is truth, but truth is not always appearance. </seg>
<seg id="188"> What are you running from, Magistrate Philipse? Damn you, Crane. </seg>
<seg id="189"> - You had a mind to help me? - Yes, and it's put me in mortal dread of... Of powers against which there is no defense. Come. </seg>
<seg id="190"> How did you know the Widow Winship was expecting a child? </seg>
<seg id="191"> She told me. - Then I deduce you are the father. - I'm not the father. Did she tell you the name of the child's father? </seg>
<seg id="192"> Yes, she did. She came to me for advice as town magistrate to protect the rights of her child. </seg>
<seg id="193"> I was bound by my oath of office to keep the secret, but... </seg>
<seg id="194"> Do you believe the father killed her? The Horseman killed her. </seg>
<seg id="195"> How often do I have to tell you? There is no Horseman. </seg>
<seg id="196"> What is that thing? My talisman. It protects me from the Horseman. </seg>
<seg id="197"> You, a magistrate, and your head full of such nonsense. Now, tell me the name of... </seg>
<seg id="198"> Oh, my God. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Constable Crane? Constable Crane? </seg>
<seg id="200"> Has he not come out at all? </seg>
<seg id="201"> - It was a headless horseman. - You must not excite yourself. </seg>
<seg id="202"> But it was a headless horseman! Of course it was. That's why you're here. </seg>
<seg id="203"> No, you must believe me. It was a horseman, a dead one. Headless. </seg>
<seg id="204"> I know. I know. You don't know because you were not there! It's all true. </seg>
<seg id="205"> Of course it is. I told you. Everyone told you. </seg>
<seg id="206"> I saw him. </seg>
<seg id="207"> I suppose it's back to the city, then. </seg>
<seg id="208"> All right, this time I'll go to New York myself. </seg>
<seg id="209"> I won't be fobbed off with an amateur deductor. </seg>
<seg id="210"> This time, it's a magistrate that's dead and... </seg>
<seg id="211"> Gentlemen. I need able men to go with me into the Western Woods. </seg>
<seg id="212"> You? We thought you'd shot your bolt. </seg>
<seg id="213"> I have faced my fears, and come out determined to locate the Horseman's grave. </seg>
<seg id="214"> In short, to pit myself against a murdering ghost. </seg>
<seg id="215"> Who's with me? </seg>
<seg id="216"> Me. </seg>
<seg id="217"> The Van Garretts, Widow Winship, your father, Jonathan Masbath, and now Philipse. Something must connect them. </seg>
<seg id="218"> Did your father have dealings with the Van Garretts? </seg>
<seg id="219"> He worked for them. We lived in the coach house. It's nothing. </seg>
<seg id="220"> But there was something that happened one night, a week before the murder. An argument upstairs between father and son. </seg>
<seg id="221"> And my father was later sent for by Mr. Van Garrett. </seg>
<seg id="222"> An argument between father and son. </seg>
<seg id="223"> After which the elder Van Garrett sent for his servant Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="224"> Listen. </seg>
<seg id="225"> - I hear nothing. - Nor I. </seg>
<seg id="226"> No birds. No crickets. It's all gone so quiet. </seg>
<seg id="227"> Quicken pace. </seg>
<seg id="228"> Pardon our intrusion, - but perhaps you could help us? - You're from the Hollow. Yes. In a way, yes. </seg>
<seg id="229"> I should like to say that I make no assumptions about your occupation. </seg>
<seg id="230"> Nor your ways, which, which, which are nothing to me, whatever you are. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Each to his own. Oh. Do you know of the Horseman, ma'am? The Hessian? </seg>
<seg id="232"> That'll be him, ma'am. You, come with me. Go out, child. Keep away. Whatever you hear, keep away. </seg>
<seg id="233"> What might he hear that he must keep away from? </seg>
<seg id="234"> He rides. To the Hollow and back. - I hear him. I smell the blood on him. - Do you? </seg>
<seg id="235"> Well, I'm here to find him and make him stop. You seek knowledge of the netherworld? I can show you. </seg>
<seg id="236"> - What are you doing? - Do not move or speak. </seg>
<seg id="237"> When the other comes, I will hold him. </seg>
<seg id="238"> - The other? - Silence. He comes now. </seg>
<seg id="239"> Madam? Madam, do you hear me? </seg>
<seg id="240"> You seek the warrior bathed in blood, the Headless Horseman. </seg>
<seg id="241"> Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies. Follow it to the Tree of the Dead. Climb down to the Horseman's resting place. </seg>
<seg id="242"> We're leaving. </seg>
<seg id="243"> We take the Indian trail to the Tree of the Dead. </seg>
<seg id="244"> - How will we recognize it? - Without difficulty, I rather fear. </seg>
<seg id="245"> We climb down to the Horseman's resting place. </seg>
<seg id="246"> - His camp? - His grave. </seg>
<seg id="247"> Stay here. </seg>
<seg id="248"> Halt and turn, I have a pistol aimed. </seg>
<seg id="249"> Katrina? I might have killed you. Why have you come? </seg>
<seg id="250"> Because no one else would go with you. </seg>
<seg id="251"> Well, then I am now twice the man. It is your white magic. </seg>
<seg id="252"> The Tree of the Dead. </seg>
<seg id="253"> Blood. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Stay where you are. </seg>
<seg id="255"> - What is it? - Just stay where you are. Don't move. </seg>
<seg id="256"> This tree is a gateway. A gateway between two worlds. </seg>
<seg id="257"> This ground has been disturbed. The soil is loose. </seg>
<seg id="258"> Bring the shovel. </seg>
<seg id="259"> The skull is gone. Taken. </seg>
<seg id="260"> That is why the Horseman returns from the grave. </seg>
<seg id="261"> To take heads till his own is restored to him. </seg>
<seg id="262"> Ichabod? </seg>
<seg id="263"> Split up. Glenn. Theodore. </seg>
<seg id="264"> Don't pick your teeth, you'll teach Thomas bad habits. </seg>
<seg id="265"> - I am a bad habit. There's nothing for it. - Oh, isn't there? - Come on, let's get ready for bed. - Yes. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Beth, run! </seg>
<seg id="267"> Stay quiet. </seg>
<seg id="268"> - Wait! He's not after you. - I'll get him. </seg>
<seg id="269"> We cannot win this. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Remarkable. A wound like this should've killed him. </seg>
<seg id="271"> But it needs no stitch, and there's hardly a loss of blood. </seg>
<seg id="272"> You must be still. The fever is on you. </seg>
<seg id="273"> Katrina. </seg>
<seg id="274"> Nostradamus mediamus, milk of mercy, in media nos laudamas. </seg>
<seg id="275"> Katrina, I tried to stop Brom, but... </seg>
<seg id="276"> Drink this down. It'll make you sleep. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The Horseman was not set to kill Brom or me. Had Brom not attacked him... </seg>
<seg id="278"> Later. Rest now. </seg>
<seg id="279"> I've discovered something. The Horseman does not kill at random. </seg>
<seg id="280"> His victims are chosen by someone who controls him. </seg>
<seg id="281"> By that very person who took his skull. </seg>
<seg id="282"> Someone who knew where to dig. </seg>
<seg id="283"> Someone of flesh and blood, as I've always said. - These are ravings. - Drink. </seg>
<seg id="284"> - You were dreaming. - Yes. </seg>
<seg id="285"> Things I had forgotten. </seg>
<seg id="286"> - And would not like to remember. - Tell me what you dreamt. </seg>
<seg id="287"> My mother was an innocent. A child of nature. </seg>
<seg id="288"> Condemned. Murdered. By my father. </seg>
<seg id="289"> - Murdered by... - Murdered to save her soul by a Bible-black tyrant behind a mask of righteousness. </seg>
<seg id="290"> I was seven when I lost my faith. </seg>
<seg id="291"> What do you believe in? </seg>
<seg id="292"> Sense and reason. Cause and consequence. I should not have come to this place, where my rational mind has been so controverted by the spirit world. Will you take nothing from Sleepy Hollow that was worth the coming here? </seg>
<seg id="293"> No. No, not nothing. </seg>
<seg id="294"> A kiss from a lovely young woman, before she saw my face or knew my name. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Yes, without sense or reason. </seg>
<seg id="296"> Forgive me, I speak of kisses </seg>
<seg id="297"> and you've lost your brave man, Brom. I have shed my tears for Brom, and yet my heart is not broken. - Do you think me wicked? - No. </seg>
<seg id="298"> But perhaps there is a bit of a witch in you, Katrina. - Why do you say that? - Because you have bewitched me. </seg>
<seg id="299"> - You slept like the dead. - You're too kind to me. </seg>
<seg id="300"> I do not look to be served by the lady of the house. Nor would you be, but that the servant girl has vanished. - Sarah? - Run away like so many others. They're all leaving in fear. </seg>
<seg id="301"> Where is Katrina? She watched over you till dawn. Now it is her turn to sleep. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Well, I'm fit for another day, I think. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Fit enough to face a mortal adversary. </seg>
<seg id="304"> Doctor Lancaster, Reverend Steenwyck, Notary Hardenbrook, and Magistrate Philipse. Who tried to cut and run, and lost his head. </seg>
<seg id="305"> There is conspiracy here. </seg>
<seg id="306"> The doctor, the reverend, the notary and the magistrate. </seg>
<seg id="307"> What is this secret that unites them? </seg>
<seg id="308"> Magistrate Philipse knew there were five bodies to four graves. He knew the Widow was pregnant. He would not tell me the name of the father. </seg>
<seg id="309"> What does this point to? </seg>
<seg id="310"> We must proceed by a process of elimination. </seg>
<seg id="311"> I shall make a list of every man and woman in Sleepy Hollow, starting with its chief citizen, Baltus Van Tassel. </seg>
<seg id="312"> I feel we're getting very close. Yes, I suppose Baltus is the chief citizen, now that old Van Garrett is dead. Yes, the Van Garretts. I'd almost forgotten them. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Come with me. - Where? - To Notary Hardenbrook's. - Have you thought of something? - Yes. I have. </seg>
<seg id="314"> Hopeless. </seg>
<seg id="315"> My father's satchel. Why is it here? </seg>
<seg id="316"> - Leave me alone. - Notary Hardenbrook. </seg>
<seg id="317"> Just as soon as you show me the last will and testament of old man Van Garrett. The will leaves everything to his son. Who died with him. So the estate passes to the next of kin. </seg>
<seg id="318"> - Naturally. All legal and above board. - Sir. I'm a dead man. No. </seg>
<seg id="319"> Van Garrett's seal. Broken. </seg>
<seg id="320"> Seems Van Garrett made a new will just before he died. Naming Widow Winship? </seg>
<seg id="321"> And here, look. A marriage certificate. </seg>
<seg id="322"> Old Van Garrett secretly married the Widow. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Left everything to her and her unborn child. </seg>
<seg id="324"> So the new will stood between the Van Garrett fortune and the person who would have otherwise inherited everything. It's true. But we four were drawn in against our will. </seg>
<seg id="325"> - Your will? - He means... </seg>
<seg id="326"> Of course. The four town elders. </seg>
<seg id="327"> Now I see what parts you had to play. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Reverend Steenwyck knew the secret because he performed the marriage. Dr. Lancaster attended the pregnant woman. Magistrate Philipse gave protection of the law. And Notary Hardenbrook concealed the documents, which had been entrusted by Van Garrett to his faithful servant. </seg>
<seg id="329"> The four conspirators drawn into the plot. </seg>
<seg id="330"> We did not know it was a murdering plot. </seg>
<seg id="331"> But I have not finished, sir. </seg>
<seg id="332"> First, the Van Garretts, father and son, slain by a horseman raised from the grave to chop heads. </seg>
<seg id="333"> Now, up pops a widow with a claim on a fortune. Off with her head! But murder begets murder. </seg>
<seg id="334"> It was the servant, Jonathan Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="335"> The night father and son quarreled over the new will, </seg>
<seg id="336"> Jonathan Masbath was summoned upstairs to bear witness. </seg>
<seg id="337"> Here is his signature. I'm afraid it was his death warrant, young Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="338"> The Horseman came for him. </seg>
<seg id="339"> Came for him at the bidding of someone who had power over him. </seg>
<seg id="340"> Someone who dug in the earth in the Western Woods and stole the skull. </seg>
<seg id="341"> The missing head, which must be restored to the Horseman before he will return to Hell. </seg>
<seg id="342"> Someone who stood to gain or lose a fortune. </seg>
<seg id="343"> None other than Van Garrett's next of kin, Baltus Van Tassel! </seg>
<seg id="344"> - Katrina? Why are you in my room? - Because it is yours. </seg>
<seg id="345"> - Was it wicked of me? - No. </seg>
<seg id="346"> I missed you. Where did you go? To the notary. </seg>
<seg id="347"> I had questions to ask Hardenbrook. And did you learn anything of interest? </seg>
<seg id="348"> Perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="349"> - My father... - Your father? Yes. My father thinks you should return to New York. Really? Why is that? </seg>
<seg id="350"> I don't know. Perhaps he looked in your ledger and did not like what he saw. </seg>
<seg id="351"> - What have you there? - Evidence. I'm sorry, I must ask you... </seg>
<seg id="352"> Then I'll leave you to your thoughts. </seg>
<seg id="353"> - It's just a spider. - Kill it! Kill it! No, no, stomp it! </seg>
<seg id="354"> - There's something under here. - What is it? </seg>
<seg id="355"> - Help me move the bed. - No, no, I mustn't. You do it. </seg>
<seg id="356"> The evil eye. It is someone casting spells against you. </seg>
<seg id="357"> The evil eye? </seg>
<seg id="358"> Wait here. </seg>
<seg id="359"> Katrina, you took the evidence and burned it. So you would not have it to accuse my father. </seg>
<seg id="360"> I accuse no one. But if there is guilt, I cannot alter it, no matter how much it grieves me. And no spells of yours can alter it, either. </seg>
<seg id="361"> Your father has the motive. It is he who stands to profit from these murders. </seg>
<seg id="362"> If you knew him, you would not have such harsh thoughts about him. </seg>
<seg id="363"> No, nor if you felt anything for me. I am pinioned by a chain of reasoning. </seg>
<seg id="364"> Why else did his four friends conspire to conceal... You are the constable, not I. </seg>
<seg id="365"> So find another chain of reasoning and let me be. </seg>
<seg id="366"> I cannot, not the one or the other. And I am heartsick with it. I think you have no heart. And I had a mind once to give you mine. </seg>
<seg id="367"> Yes, I think you loved me that day when you followed me into the Western Woods to have braved such peril. </seg>
<seg id="368"> What peril was there for me, if it was my own father who controlled the Headless Horseman? </seg>
<seg id="369"> Goodbye, Ichabod Crane. I curse the day you came to Sleepy Hollow. </seg>
<seg id="370"> - She will not see you. - Did she say anything? </seg>
<seg id="371"> Only that she will not come down. </seg>
<seg id="372"> I see. Thank you. Constable? </seg>
<seg id="373"> You have not asked me how I have hurt my hand since yesterday, which would have been polite. </seg>
<seg id="374"> In fact, you have been as careful not to look at it as not to mention it. </seg>
<seg id="375"> Yes, I'm sorry. How did you... - I know you saw me. - What? I know you followed last night. </seg>
<seg id="376"> And you must promise not to tell my husband what you saw. Promise me! </seg>
<seg id="377"> The town is in ferment. Horror piled on tragedy. Hardenbrook is dead. </seg>
<seg id="378"> - Oh, no! That harmless old man? - Hanged himself in the night. Hanged himself? </seg>
<seg id="379"> Reverend Steenwyck's called a meeting in the church tonight. </seg>
<seg id="380"> Every man, woman, and child is going to speak out against you. </seg>
<seg id="381"> If you are wise, you will leave this place. </seg>
<seg id="382"> - What is that? - I was careless with the kitchen knife. </seg>
<seg id="383"> The wound looks angry. I will bind it later with wild arrowroot flowers. I know where some grow. </seg>
<seg id="384"> Come on, hurry up. The meeting bell started tolling. </seg>
<seg id="385"> The Horseman! - Katrina! - Father? </seg>
<seg id="386"> The Horseman! Save me! </seg>
<seg id="387"> He killed her. The Horseman killed your stepmother. Oh, God! </seg>
<seg id="388"> Fire! </seg>
<seg id="389"> You'll kill us all! You're the one the Horseman wants. </seg>
<seg id="390"> He cannot enter. Over here! </seg>
<seg id="391"> The Horseman cannot enter. Why should we die for you? </seg>
<seg id="392"> The Horseman cannot enter. He cannot cross the gate. We have to save ourselves. </seg>
<seg id="393"> The next person that lays a hand on me will get a bullet! </seg>
<seg id="394"> He's coming back! </seg>
<seg id="395"> Enough have died already. It's time to confess our sins. </seg>
<seg id="396"> - What is it that you know? - Your four friends played you false. </seg>
<seg id="397"> We were devilishly possessed by one who... </seg>
<seg id="398"> Get out of my way! Stand back! Stay back! </seg>
<seg id="399"> Back! Stand back! </seg>
<seg id="400"> There is a conspiracy here, and I will shake it out. </seg>
<seg id="401"> It was an evil spirit possessed you. </seg>
<seg id="402"> I pray God it is satisfied now, and that you find peace. </seg>
<seg id="403"> The evil eye's done its work. My life is over, spared for a lifetime of horrors in my sleep, waking each day to grief. </seg>
<seg id="404"> Goodbye, Katrina. </seg>
<seg id="405"> - You think it was Katrina, don't you? - That can never be uttered. </seg>
<seg id="406"> A strange sort of witch, with a kind and loving heart. </seg>
<seg id="407"> - How can you think so? - I have good reason. </seg>
<seg id="408"> - Then you are bewitched by reason. - I am beaten down by it! </seg>
<seg id="409"> It is a hard lesson for a hard world, and you had better learn it, young Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="410"> Villainy wears many masks. None so dangerous as the mask of virtue. </seg>
<seg id="411"> Farewell. </seg>
<seg id="412"> - Van Ripper, turn the coach. - What? Turn around now! </seg>
<seg id="413"> Pardon my intrusion. </seg>
<seg id="414"> No blood flow, no clotting, no healing. When this cut was made, this woman was already dead. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Dear stepdaughter, you look as if you'd seen a ghost. </seg>
<seg id="416"> Rise up once more, my dark avenger. </seg>
<seg id="417"> One more night of beheading. Rise up with your sword. </seg>
<seg id="418"> A head for a head. </seg>
<seg id="419"> My unholy horseman, rise! </seg>
<seg id="420"> Come now for Katrina! </seg>
<seg id="421"> Awake at last. Did you think it was all a nasty dream? </seg>
<seg id="422"> Father saw the Horseman kill you. </seg>
<seg id="423"> He saw the Horseman come towards me with his sword unsheathed, but it is I who govern the Horseman, my dear. </seg>
<seg id="424"> And Baltus did not stay to watch. </seg>
<seg id="425"> - But there was a body. - The servant girl, Sarah. </seg>
<seg id="426"> And I always thought she was useless. </seg>
<seg id="427"> But it seems she had a purpose after all. </seg>
<seg id="428"> Who are you? - My family name was Archer. - The archer. </seg>
<seg id="429"> I lived with my father and mother and sister in a cottage not far from here. Until one day my father died, and the landlord, who had received many years of loyal service from my parents, evicted us. </seg>
<seg id="430"> No one in this God-fearing town would take us in because my mother was suspected of witchcraft. </seg>
<seg id="431"> But she schooled her daughters well, while we lived as outcasts in the Western Woods. </seg>
<seg id="432"> She died within a year. </seg>
<seg id="433"> My sister and I remained in our refuge, seeing not a soul. </seg>
<seg id="434"> Until one day, whilst gathering firewood, we crossed the path of the Hessian. </seg>
<seg id="435"> I saw his death. </seg>
<seg id="436"> At that moment, I offered my soul to Satan, if he would raise the Hessian from the grave to avenge me. </seg>
<seg id="437"> - Avenge you? - Against Van Garrett. </seg>
<seg id="438"> The landlord who showed us no mercy and left us to starve, whilst Baltus Van Tassel and his simpering wife and girl child stole our home. </seg>
<seg id="439"> I swore I would make myself mistress of all he had. </seg>
<seg id="440"> The easiest part was the first. To enter your house as your mother's sick nurse, and put her body into the grave and my own into the marriage bed. </seg>
<seg id="441"> Not quite so easy was to secure my legacy. </seg>
<seg id="442"> The Widow had to go, of course. </seg>
<seg id="443"> And the servant, Masbath. And then, just the other day, that silly midwife Killian told me the Widow had told her a big secret. </seg>
<seg id="444"> And she told me this right in front of her husband. What a goose! </seg>
<seg id="445"> So, another little job for the Horseman. </seg>
<seg id="446"> But lust delivered the Reverend Steenwyck into my power. </seg>
<seg id="447"> Fear did the same for the notary, Hardenbrook, and the drunkard Philipse. </seg>
<seg id="448"> And the doctor's silence I exchanged for my complicity in his fornications with the servant girl, Sarah. </seg>
<seg id="449"> - Yes, you have everything now. - No. </seg>
<seg id="450"> You have, my dear, by your father's will. I get everything in the event of your death. </seg>
<seg id="451"> My sister, by the way, sadly passed away. </seg>
<seg id="452"> Quite recently. </seg>
<seg id="453"> You killed your own sister? She brought it on herself by helping you and your master. </seg>
<seg id="454"> You're just in time to have your head cut off. </seg>
<seg id="455"> The Horseman comes! And tonight, he comes for you! </seg>
<seg id="456"> Katrina! Thank God. </seg>
<seg id="457"> Watch your head. </seg>
<seg id="458"> To the roof! I have an idea. </seg>
<seg id="459"> Jump for the sails. </seg>
<seg id="460"> Jump! </seg>
<seg id="461"> Hurry! </seg>
<seg id="462"> - Is he dead? - That's the problem. He was dead to begin with. </seg>
<seg id="463"> - Where are we going? - Anywhere but here. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Here, take the reins. </seg>
<seg id="465"> Ichabod! </seg>
<seg id="466"> My bag! </seg>
<seg id="467"> Jump! </seg>
<seg id="468"> - Still alive? - Run, Katrina. </seg>
<seg id="469"> Yes, do run, and jump, and skip. </seg>
<seg id="470"> No! Here! Take her! She's yours! </seg>
<seg id="471"> Sir, you're not dead. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Horseman! </seg>
<seg id="473"> Just in time for a new century. </seg>
<seg id="474"> You'll soon get your bearings, young Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="475"> The Bronx is up, the Battery's down, and home is this way. </seg>
