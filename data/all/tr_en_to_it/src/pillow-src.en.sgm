<seg id="1"> It was on my fourth birthday... When my aunt was reading sei shonagon... </seg>
<seg id="2"> That I saw my father and his publisher together... For the first time. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Though I'm certain that any clear understanding of what I had witnessed... </seg>
<seg id="4"> Would have to wait until I was much older. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On my sixth birthday... At the matsuo tiasha shrine in kyoto, </seg>
<seg id="6"> Encouraged by my aunt, I vowed I would keep a diary. A pillow book of my own. </seg>
<seg id="7"> I would fill it with all manner of observations, Just like sei shonagon. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Perhaps one day, like her, I could fill it with accounts of all my lovers. </seg>
<seg id="9"> On the same day as I started to keep my own pillow book, </seg>
<seg id="10"> I met my future husband for the first time. </seg>
<seg id="11"> I was six. He was ten. </seg>
<seg id="12"> We did not exchange a word. </seg>
<seg id="13"> He had been handpicked by my father's publisher. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Like sei shonagon, my sense of smell was very strong. </seg>
<seg id="15"> I enjoyed the smell of paper of all kinds. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It reminded me of the scent of skin. </seg>
<seg id="17"> My mother had taught me mandarin. </seg>
<seg id="18"> When my father painted a japanese greeting... On my face on my birthday, She played her favorite chinese record. </seg>
<seg id="19"> It had been popular when my parents had met in shanghai. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In remembrance of my father and in memory of sei shonagon, I was determined to take lovers who would remind me... </seg>
<seg id="21"> Of the pleasures of calligraphy. </seg>
<seg id="22"> I could not be sure which was more important... </seg>
<seg id="23"> An indifferent calligrapher who was a good lover... </seg>
<seg id="24"> Or an excellent lover who was a poor calligrapher. </seg>
<seg id="25"> I became a wife. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I married. </seg>
<seg id="27"> I acquired a husband. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Whichever way you say it, It was bound to end badly. </seg>
<seg id="29"> I had a ceremonial wedding in style. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Separated from my parents and my aunt, </seg>
<seg id="31"> I confided in my own pillow book more and more frequently. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Like the pillow book of sei shonagon, it was full of lists. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Unlike sei shonagon, all the lists were negative. </seg>
<seg id="34"> That was the first fire. </seg>
<seg id="35"> There was to be a second. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Both fires marked a big change in my life. </seg>
<seg id="37"> When I first arrived in hong kong, I hid. </seg>
<seg id="38"> I lived in kowloon city in the cheapest rooming houses I could find. </seg>
<seg id="39"> I did not want to be found by my parents. Or by my husband. </seg>
<seg id="40"> I tried hard to improve the chinese my mother had taught me. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In the meantime, I was determined... To keep alive my father's tradition. </seg>
<seg id="42"> I learned to type on my 21st birthday, </seg>
<seg id="43"> I tried to give myself my father's blessing. </seg>
<seg id="44"> I found work in the offices of a japanese designer. </seg>
<seg id="45"> And I was determined to speak english with an american accent. </seg>
<seg id="46"> I was planning to go to California. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Twenty meter of pale green organdy, pattern 14. </seg>
<seg id="48"> A meter of type-b tulle. </seg>
<seg id="49"> The small net size. </seg>
<seg id="50"> The type-b tulle with the small net size. </seg>
<seg id="51"> We went to kyoto, back to japan, To work in the matuso tiasha shrine, Which sei shonagon had visited regularly. </seg>
<seg id="52"> I couldn't give up such an opportunity. </seg>
<seg id="53"> I was also a little homesick. </seg>
<seg id="54"> We didn't finish walking the catwalk until midnight... When all the audience had gone. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Sei shonagon had watched the moon rise in that garden... A thousand years ago. </seg>
<seg id="56"> I could have walked up and down that path all night long. </seg>
<seg id="57"> You are not in a position to preach clean living. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Oh, yes, I am. And in blood red. </seg>
<seg id="59"> You could join us. </seg>
<seg id="60"> I'm too beautiful... And too rich. </seg>
<seg id="61"> - What's wealth got to do with it? - A great deal, I'd think. </seg>
<seg id="62"> I design material. You can wear it. </seg>
<seg id="63"> Frighten the buyers. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Then I'd soon cease to be wealthy. </seg>
<seg id="65"> You wouldn't need to be paid. You would do it for free. Oh, yeah? What else would you do for free? </seg>
<seg id="66"> I've been waiting to waste my talent on your body... </seg>
<seg id="67"> For a little reward. </seg>
<seg id="68"> My search for the ideal lover-calligrapher continued. </seg>
<seg id="69"> But it was becoming less and less likely that I would find him. </seg>
<seg id="70"> If they were old, they were invariably in no position... To take advantage of what I had to offer. </seg>
<seg id="71"> And if they were young, they were often easily distracted. </seg>
<seg id="72"> It's them! </seg>
<seg id="73"> Don't look! Don't look. </seg>
<seg id="74"> What are you doing here? Are you responsible for this? </seg>
<seg id="75"> You shrimp! What do you think you're doing? Shut up! </seg>
<seg id="76"> They were children playing a game. </seg>
<seg id="77"> They used hoki, the japanese photographer from tokyo, As a pawn to find me. </seg>
<seg id="78"> I want those photos. </seg>
<seg id="79"> I had once kissed him on the cheek in a moment of happiness. </seg>
<seg id="80"> - You're a creep. - I'm sorry. I have watched you, followed you everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="81"> It's only too obvious. And I could help you. You haven't done too well so far. </seg>
<seg id="82"> You are very beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="83"> I employed a calligrapher... With an obsession for mathematics. </seg>
<seg id="84"> While his wife sang and waited in the kitchen, This account clerk filled my back with additions, My front with subtractions. </seg>
<seg id="85"> I contacted a magazine designer... </seg>
<seg id="86"> Who insisted that I came back to his apartment in the new territories, Where he could show me off to his parents who wanted grandchildren. </seg>
<seg id="87"> - Write "dear nagiko." - What? </seg>
<seg id="88"> - I took risks. - Where? </seg>
<seg id="89"> - Here. - I can't. </seg>
<seg id="90"> - Yes, you can. - Who knows what casual meeting would produce a surprise. </seg>
<seg id="91"> Nagiko? </seg>
<seg id="92"> Some of the great japanese calligraphers... Were very modest and unassuming men. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Humble clerks by day, daring poets by night. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Good. Now write something else here. With great trepidation, I sought to move away from what I knew best. </seg>
<seg id="95"> After all, there were other great calligraphic traditions. </seg>
<seg id="96"> What have you written? That's for you to find out. How am I going to do that? </seg>
<seg id="97"> You know, some cultures permit no images. </seg>
<seg id="98"> Perhaps some cultures ought to permit no visible text. </seg>
<seg id="99"> I need writing. </seg>
<seg id="100"> Don't ask me why. Just take out your pen and, </seg>
<seg id="101"> Please, write your name on my arm. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Go on. </seg>
<seg id="103"> I met an english translator at the cafe typo. </seg>
<seg id="104"> He said he spoke four languages, including yiddish. </seg>
<seg id="105"> I'll give you another chance. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Write on my back. </seg>
<seg id="107"> Well, what shall I write? </seg>
<seg id="108"> Write... </seg>
<seg id="109"> "we met for the first time at the cafe typo." </seg>
<seg id="110"> Write in three languages... </seg>
<seg id="111"> Japanese, french and english. </seg>
<seg id="112"> Waitress! </seg>
<seg id="113"> Are we going to do more writing? </seg>
<seg id="114"> Perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="115"> You smell strange. Do you use perfume? And your fingers. What's wrong with my fingers? </seg>
<seg id="116"> I'll give you another chance. The last one. </seg>
<seg id="117"> Write on my breasts. A little inappropriate. </seg>
<seg id="118"> I'll decide what's inappropriate. </seg>
<seg id="119"> Write in yiddish. What's yiddish for "breasts"? </seg>
<seg id="120"> If you're a writer, surely you'd write on anything? </seg>
<seg id="121"> This is not going to work. </seg>
<seg id="122"> You're not a writer. </seg>
<seg id="123"> This is not writing; It's scribbling. </seg>
<seg id="124"> Distasteful scribbling. </seg>
<seg id="125"> Get out. </seg>
<seg id="126"> You're not a writer; You're a scribbler. </seg>
<seg id="127"> I've watched you with your little typewriter go click, click, clack. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Get out. Go! </seg>
<seg id="129"> You could show me. </seg>
<seg id="130"> - Go on. - No. I can't. </seg>
<seg id="131"> How can I get pleasure writing on you? </seg>
<seg id="132"> You have to write on me. Go on. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Use my body like the pages of a book. </seg>
<seg id="134"> Of your book. </seg>
<seg id="135"> Not a special writing instrument at all. </seg>
<seg id="136"> I began very tentatively, </seg>
<seg id="137"> Thinking of sei shonagon's lists of anatomical comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="138"> The thoughts were often hers, But the words were entirely mine. </seg>
<seg id="139"> For my first experiment in using flesh as paper, I made a deal with an englishman who was entirely ignorant of oriental languages. </seg>
<seg id="140"> Hoki, this is where you can prove you have my interests at heart. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Come here quickly. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Off you go. Beautiful photographs. And you don't get paid because you owe me. </seg>
<seg id="143"> This is where I begin to do the writing. </seg>
<seg id="144"> I'm now going to be the pen, not just the paper. </seg>
<seg id="145"> I could help you. </seg>
<seg id="146"> I think not. </seg>
<seg id="147"> Why not? What's wrong with me? </seg>
<seg id="148"> Because you are from kyoto, and you're young. </seg>
<seg id="149"> And your handwriting is illegible. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Besides, your skin does not make a good paper. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Watch. </seg>
<seg id="152"> You see? In my diary, I called you "the blotter." </seg>
<seg id="153"> Hoki the blotter. </seg>
<seg id="154"> I could help you. </seg>
<seg id="155"> I think not. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Why not? </seg>
<seg id="157"> You're none too smart with compliments. </seg>
<seg id="158"> Let me try. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Let me try. </seg>
<seg id="160"> Hoki set off at dawn for a foreign language bookshop... In kowloon city in a street full of restaurants. He finally gave the packet to some doorman. </seg>
<seg id="161"> "We feel that we are unable to consider... "publication of this material. It's not worth the paper it's written on." </seg>
<seg id="162"> So they're not satisfied with the quality of the paper. </seg>
<seg id="163"> Perhaps it's not japanese enough. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Try writing on me. </seg>
<seg id="165"> Seduce him. </seg>
<seg id="166"> I met jerome in the cafe typo... And asked him for the services of a translator. </seg>
<seg id="167"> He gave me a choice of six languages. </seg>
<seg id="168"> They had increased by two. </seg>
<seg id="169"> I talked to him and I flattered him, </seg>
<seg id="170"> And I admired all the books he had yet to write. </seg>
<seg id="171"> You have to sign here. </seg>
<seg id="172"> Our first transaction was strictly financial. </seg>
<seg id="173"> He wanted to pay the bill but had no money. </seg>
<seg id="174"> He offered to write a check but had no checkbook. </seg>
<seg id="175"> I volunteered the palm of my hand. </seg>
<seg id="176"> If I could not seduce the publisher, Then perhaps I could seduce the publisher's lover. </seg>
<seg id="177"> His writing, in so many languages, Made me a signpost pointing east, west, north and south. </seg>
<seg id="178"> I had shoes in german, stockings in french, Gloves in hebrew, a hat with a veil in italian. </seg>
<seg id="179"> He only kept me naked where I was most accustomed to wear clothes. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Shut up. Go away. Go away. </seg>
<seg id="181"> I would like to honor my father by becoming a writer. </seg>
<seg id="182"> I could help. </seg>
<seg id="183"> I could learn new languages... </seg>
<seg id="184"> To make you understood... All over the world. </seg>
<seg id="185"> When god made his first human being... He painted in the eyes. And lips. And the sex. </seg>
<seg id="186"> And when god approved of his creation... He was obliged to sign his name. </seg>
<seg id="187"> There are so many publishers in the world. Why worry about this one? </seg>
<seg id="188"> I have my reasons. </seg>
<seg id="189"> I suspect it's because he rejected you so swiftly, And few people, if any, have ever done that. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="191"> But... If you're so determined to be published by him, The publisher who rejects you and who loves me... Then I have a plan. </seg>
<seg id="192"> I could be your messenger. You could write on me. </seg>
<seg id="193"> And with your permission and, of course, your blessing, I could... Pay your publishing friend a visit? </seg>
<seg id="194"> A sacrifice? </seg>
<seg id="195"> But not without pleasure for you? </seg>
<seg id="196"> Perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="197"> You could be jealous? </seg>
<seg id="198"> It's worked. He won't let me go. Wait for me. </seg>
<seg id="199"> He's thinking of an edition of 3,000... </seg>
<seg id="200"> If there are more, and there will be more, won't there? </seg>
<seg id="201"> I'll see you this evening. Wait for me here. </seg>
<seg id="202"> Hey, you are enjoying it too much. </seg>
<seg id="203"> But with your permission. And only according to the quality of the writing. </seg>
<seg id="204"> If you don't hurry it along, I'll be looking for someone else. </seg>
<seg id="205"> You dare. </seg>
<seg id="206"> He's making me wait. Buy some new paper. </seg>
<seg id="207"> Don't get so upset. You could use me. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Give me two more of these and some more of this and some stuff for him. </seg>
<seg id="209"> You could have babies. </seg>
<seg id="210"> - They're not bad-looking ladies. - I need some skin, two meters and a half. </seg>
<seg id="211"> - Sorry? - Back and front. </seg>
<seg id="212"> I could give you three and a half. </seg>
<seg id="213"> True, but the quality of the paper would not attract my fastidious publisher. </seg>
<seg id="214"> Jerome! </seg>
<seg id="215"> Jerome! </seg>
<seg id="216"> I need you both. Come with me? </seg>
<seg id="217"> I really do. It's like wild kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="218"> All right, you're gonna like this one. This one's funny. </seg>
<seg id="219"> Hey, you know something? </seg>
<seg id="220"> They got a song about you in america. You know what it's called? </seg>
<seg id="221"> It's called "the hokeypokey." </seg>
<seg id="222"> You get it? "The hokeypokey." </seg>
<seg id="223"> Ready? You put your right foot in you put your right foot out your put your right foot in and you shake it all about you do the hokeypokey. You turn your... </seg>
<seg id="224"> Hello. Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="225"> Americans always say they have nothing to hide. </seg>
<seg id="226"> I can see that's true. </seg>
<seg id="227"> Look what I got here? </seg>
<seg id="228"> It is a menu. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Nagiko! </seg>
<seg id="230"> I know you're there! Let me in! </seg>
<seg id="231"> Don't play games! I know you're there! </seg>
<seg id="232"> Nagiko! </seg>
<seg id="233"> I met your friend. I met your fat friend. </seg>
<seg id="234"> He was nice? Was he nice? </seg>
<seg id="235"> He was covered in my paint! My paint for my body! </seg>
<seg id="236"> Oh, my god! What have I done? What have I done? </seg>
<seg id="237"> Please let me in! </seg>
<seg id="238"> I love you, nagiko. </seg>
<seg id="239"> I love you. Talk to me. </seg>
<seg id="240"> Nagiko! </seg>
<seg id="241"> Please! </seg>
<seg id="242"> I won't play games. </seg>
<seg id="243"> Let me in! Let me in! </seg>
<seg id="244"> Why won't she talk to me? </seg>
<seg id="245"> I don't know. </seg>
<seg id="246"> What do you mean, you don't know? Have you seen her? When did you last see her? </seg>
<seg id="247"> Whiskey. </seg>
<seg id="248"> Whiskey. </seg>
<seg id="249"> She comes here, you know, to pick up her clients. </seg>
<seg id="250"> She almost lives here. </seg>
<seg id="251"> The waiters are all pimps. </seg>
<seg id="252"> She makes sure they are very smooth-skinned. </seg>
<seg id="253"> You know? Between the legs? </seg>
<seg id="254"> Her maid usually washes them... With lemon juice to make their skin soft... And smooth. </seg>
<seg id="255"> But you could scare her. </seg>
<seg id="256"> You are a writer, </seg>
<seg id="257"> Like in romeo and juliet. </seg>
<seg id="258"> Shakespeare? </seg>
<seg id="259"> Jerome! </seg>
<seg id="260"> Jerome, I'm sorry. </seg>
<seg id="261"> We can start again from where we left off. </seg>
<seg id="262"> I was angry. You deceived me... </seg>
<seg id="263"> With a man I detest, with a man who blackmailed my father. </seg>
<seg id="264"> But... We can revenge him. </seg>
<seg id="265"> We need to work. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Jerome! </seg>
<seg id="267"> Jerome! </seg>
<seg id="268"> Jerome always wanted to be foreign, Though not necessarily oriental. </seg>
<seg id="269"> English wasn't enough for him. </seg>
<seg id="270"> He'd never have made a writer. </seg>
<seg id="271"> He didn't have enough imagination. </seg>
<seg id="272"> Jerome was dyslexic until he was 12, Before it became fashionable. </seg>
<seg id="273"> And he broke every pair of glasses I gave him. </seg>
<seg id="274"> He hated wearing glasses. </seg>
<seg id="275"> He was very good at breaking things, </seg>
<seg id="276"> Especially relationships, just like his father. </seg>
<seg id="277"> His father was a catholic convert, always experimenting with faith. </seg>
<seg id="278"> We called our first son paul and our second jerome... After his father's confessor, who was a jesuit in singapore. </seg>
<seg id="279"> Jerome never liked me. </seg>
<seg id="280"> He preferred my sister, A little fool who was excited by modern literature. All swear words and scatology, before it became fashionable. </seg>
<seg id="281"> I hear you're fashionable. </seg>
<seg id="282"> I suppose that's what excited jerome. </seg>
<seg id="283"> We burned an effigy of jerome's car. We didn't burn his books. </seg>
<seg id="284"> They were too damp. </seg>
<seg id="285"> I burned my books... And my clothes and shoes... And the photographs and diaries. </seg>
<seg id="286"> It was the second major fire in my life. </seg>
<seg id="287"> The first fire had taken me out of japan. The second took me back. </seg>
<seg id="288"> Hoki wrote to me. </seg>
<seg id="289"> Even after jerome's death, he was still very, very jealous. </seg>
<seg id="290"> He wrote to tell me about the publisher's act of sacrilege. </seg>
<seg id="291"> I had promised jerome 13 books. </seg>
<seg id="292"> I could not now write them on jerome's body. </seg>
<seg id="293"> I found substitutes in japan. </seg>
<seg id="294"> I would write the books for the publisher as a bargain... For the return of the pillow book he had made of jerome's body. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Now you've been signed by me, You can go and do my business. </seg>
<seg id="296"> Excuse me. Can I see the manager, please? </seg>
<seg id="297"> Let's take another photograph. </seg>
<seg id="298"> Excuse me. Give it to the manager and tell him we are here. </seg>
<seg id="299"> This is the writing of Nagiko Yujikino, </seg>
<seg id="300"> And I know you to have blackmailed, Violated and humiliated my father. </seg>
<seg id="301"> I suspect you also of ruining my husband. </seg>
<seg id="302"> You have now committed the greatest crime. </seg>
<seg id="303"> You have desecrated the body of my lover. </seg>
<seg id="304"> You and I now know... That you have lived long enough. </seg>
<seg id="305"> Today, I am 28 years old. </seg>
<seg id="306"> And on my 28th birthday I have experiences enough... To write my own pillow book. </seg>
<seg id="307"> Think of that. The pillow book of Nagiko Kiyohara. </seg>
<seg id="308"> I can now make my own list of things... That make the heart beat faster. </seg>
