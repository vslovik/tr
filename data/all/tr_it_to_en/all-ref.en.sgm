<seg id="1"> January 11th, at 2:30 PM. </seg>
<seg id="2"> You'll do your statement separately, this is ours. </seg>
<seg id="3"> ...following a verbal dispute in Brooklyn Bridge Park... </seg>
<seg id="4"> Zachary Cowan, age 11, and armed with a stick </seg>
<seg id="5"> struck our son, Ethan Longstreet, in the face. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In addition ot the swelling and bruising of Ethan's upper lip </seg>
<seg id="7"> this act also resulted in two broken incisors </seg>
<seg id="8"> including nerve damage to the right incisor </seg>
<seg id="9"> - "Armed"? </seg>
<seg id="10"> Armed. You don't like armed? </seg>
<seg id="11"> Michael, what could we say? Carrying? Holding? Carring a stick? </seg>
<seg id="12"> - "Carrying", yeah. - "Carrying a stick". </seg>
<seg id="13"> - "Carrying"... </seg>
<seg id="14"> It's ironic, we always thought the Brooklyn Bridge Park was so safe compared to Hillside. </seg>
<seg id="15"> - Ture. We always said, Brooklyn Bridge Park, fine. Hillside, no way. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Just goes to show you. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Hey, thank you so much for coming! </seg>
<seg id="18"> It's so much better than getting caught up in that adversarial mindset. </seg>
<seg id="19"> - Well we thank you, really. </seg>
<seg id="20"> - There's no reason we have to thank each other. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Luckily, some of us still have a sense of community, right? </seg>
<seg id="22"> Though the kids haven't got that notion straight yet. </seg>
<seg id="23"> - I mean our kid. - Right, our kid. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Those tulips are gorgeous. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Oh it's the little florist on Henry, you know, all the way up? </seg>
<seg id="26"> Oh right! </seg>
<seg id="27"> They fly the bulbs in straight from Holland, </seg>
<seg id="28"> - That a fact? - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="29"> - Do you know the one? All the way up. - Right, right. </seg>
<seg id="30"> What about the tooth with the damaged nerve? </seg>
<seg id="31"> Oh. Well they don't know. There's still some question about the prognosis. </seg>
<seg id="32"> -  Apparently, the nerve is not completely exposed. - Only part of it is exposed. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Right. There's a part that's exposed and a part that's still protected. </seg>
<seg id="34"> - So now, they're not going to devitalize it. - They want to give the tooth a chance. </seg>
<seg id="35"> We would so like to avoid root canal. </seg>
<seg id="36"> - Of course. - So there's an observation period while they give the nerve a chance to heal. </seg>
<seg id="37"> - Meantime, he's going to need caps. - You can't have implants until you're eighteen anyway. </seg>
<seg id="38"> You can't. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The permanent implants can only be done once you stop growing. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Naturally. I hope... I hope it all turns out all right. </seg>
<seg id="41"> We can only hope. </seg>
<seg id="42"> You know, he didn't want to tell on Zachary. </seg>
<seg id="43"> No, he didn't want to tell. </seg>
<seg id="44"> I mean it was incredible to see this child with no face left, no teeth... </seg>
<seg id="45"> And he just wouldn't talk. </seg>
<seg id="46"> I can just imagine. </seg>
<seg id="47"> He didn't want to tell on the kid. Like his friends would say he was a snitch. I mean let's be honest, Penelope, it wasn't only a sense of honor. </seg>
<seg id="48"> You could say that. But a sense of honor requires a social context. </seg>
<seg id="49"> So how did you finally get Zachary's name? </seg>
<seg id="50"> Well because we explained to Ethan that protecting this child was not going to help him. </seg>
<seg id="51"> We told him, if this kid thinks he can go on hitting people and getting away with it, why should he stop? </seg>
<seg id="52"> We told him that if we were that child's parents, we would absolutely want to know about this. </seg>
<seg id="53"> - Of course. - Yeah. Excuse me one second. </seg>
<seg id="54"> Yes Walter, thanks for getting back to me. </seg>
<seg id="55"> So it's in this morning's Journal. I'll read it to you. </seg>
<seg id="56"> "According to a study published by British journal Lancet...two Australian researchers have identified...neurological side effects of TW Pharma's anti-hypertension medication Antril... including impaired hearing and ataxia." </seg>
<seg id="57"> Who the hell does your press monitoring over there? </seg>
<seg id="58"> Yeah, you're in deep shit. </seg>
<seg id="59"> No, my problem is the A.S.M. You have an Annual Stockholders Meeting in two weeks. </seg>
<seg id="60"> - Sorry. - So you're like a... - An attorney. </seg>
<seg id="61"> - And yourself? - Houseware supply. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Penelope is a writer. She works part time in a bookstore, mostly art books and history books. </seg>
<seg id="63"> - A writer! </seg>
<seg id="64"> I co-wrote a volume about Sabean civilization. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Working from artifacts recovered when they resumed digs after the Ethiopia-Eritrea conflict. </seg>
<seg id="66"> And now I have a book coming out in January about the Darfur tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="67"> So you specialize in Africa. </seg>
<seg id="68"> I'm interested in that part of the world, yes. </seg>
<seg id="69"> - Do you have any other children? - There's Courtney, she is nine. </seg>
<seg id="70"> She's very angry at her father right now. He got rid of the hamster last night. </seg>
<seg id="71"> - You got rid of the hamster? - Yeah. Made such a racket at night. </seg>
<seg id="72"> Those things sleep during the day. </seg>
<seg id="73"> Ethan was going crazy, he couldn't stand the racket that hamster made. </seg>
<seg id="74"> I don't mind telling you, I've been wanting to get rid of the thing for the longest time. </seg>
<seg id="75"> So I thought, that's it. I took it out and left it on the street. </seg>
<seg id="76"> - You left it on the street? - I figured it was a gutter-sewer kind of animal. </seg>
<seg id="77"> But it was scared out of its wits, out there, on that sidewalk. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Truth is, they're not pets and they're not wild. Drop them in the middle of the forrest they're still unhappy. I mean where are you supposed to put them? </seg>
<seg id="79"> - You just left him outside? - Yeah, he did. </seg>
<seg id="80"> And then he tried to convince Courtney that the hamster ran away. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Which, of course, she was not buying. </seg>
<seg id="82"> - And this morning the hamster was gone? - Gone. </seg>
<seg id="83"> - And what about you? What do you do for a living? - I'm an investment broker. </seg>
<seg id="84"> Let me... I'll just gonna ask this directly. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Could Zachary apologize to Ethan? </seg>
<seg id="86"> Sure. It would be good if they talked. </seg>
<seg id="87"> He's got to apologize, Alan. He has to actually say he's sorry. </seg>
<seg id="88"> - Yeah, probably. - Well, is he sorry? </seg>
<seg id="89"> He didn't realize how serious it was. He's eleven years old. </seg>
<seg id="90"> - Eleven is not a baby. - It's not an adult either. </seg>
<seg id="91"> We didn't ask you, you want some coffee or tea? </seg>
<seg id="92"> Is there any cobbler left, Penny? She makes a mean cobbler! </seg>
<seg id="93"> - You got espresso? - We do! </seg>
<seg id="94"> - I wouldn't mind a cup. - A glass of water. Yeah. Espresso for me too, babe. And bring the cobbler. Come on, come on. </seg>
<seg id="95"> Please, please have a seat. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="97"> You got to taste this cobbler. </seg>
<seg id="98"> Where's the cobbler? </seg>
<seg id="99"> She put the cobbler in the fridge again. I don't know what language I should speak to her in. </seg>
<seg id="100"> - Nice couple. - Very. </seg>
<seg id="101"> They're nice, right? - You tell everybody I'm a writer? </seg>
<seg id="102"> - You are a writer. You wrote a book. </seg>
<seg id="103"> Good cobbler is not easy to make. </seg>
<seg id="104"> - What do you sell? - Decorative hardware. Door locks, handles, copper fittings. And kitchen equipment, pots and pans. </seg>
<seg id="105"> Is that a good living? You know, it's not like we had any banner years or anything. It was tough starting out. </seg>
<seg id="106"> But long as I'm out there every morning, with my catalog and my sample case, it's a living. </seg>
<seg id="107"> Although the cast iron roasting pans do pick up around the holidays. </seg>
<seg id="108"> When you saw the hamster was terrified, why didn't you bring it home? </seg>
<seg id="109"> - Cause I don't touch them. - You put it on the sidewalk. </seg>
<seg id="110"> It was in the cage. I flipped it over. No way I'm touching those things. </seg>
<seg id="111"> - Sugar? - No, no sugar. </seg>
<seg id="112"> - What kind of cobbler you make? - Appler and pear. </seg>
<seg id="113"> - Apple and pear? - Yeah, it's a little recipe of mine. </seg>
<seg id="114"> - Apple and pear, that's new to me. </seg>
<seg id="115"> - Apple and pear is a classic. - There's a trick to it. - Really? </seg>
<seg id="116"> You have to cut the pear thicker than the apple, because they cook faster. </seg>
<seg id="117"> - Oh, right! - She's not telling you the real secret. - Let them taste it. </seg>
<seg id="118"> - Very good, very good. - Delicious! - Gingerbread crumbs! </seg>
<seg id="119"> - Oh my god! It's just a souped-up recipe, his mother gave me this idea. </seg>
<seg id="120"> - Gingerbread, fantastic! </seg>
<seg id="121"> At least we get a new recipe out of this, right? </seg>
<seg id="122"> I wish my son didn't have to lose two teeth in the process. </seg>
<seg id="123"> Right, that's what I meant. - You have a novel way of expressing it. </seg>
<seg id="124"> - No. I... Excuse me. </seg>
<seg id="125"> Yeah, Walter. </seg>
<seg id="126"> No. No letters to the editor. </seg>
<seg id="127"> You'll just fan the flames. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Was it scheduled? Yeah... </seg>
<seg id="129"> What are these disorders? What's ataxia? </seg>
<seg id="130"> And in normal doses? </seg>
<seg id="131"> How long have you known this? And in all that time you haven't recalled it? </seg>
<seg id="132"> What are we talking about in revenues? Oh, oh, I see. </seg>
<seg id="133"> - Alan! We're all waiting for you. - Yeah, right. One second. </seg>
<seg id="134"> Dennis? </seg>
<seg id="135"> They've known about the risks for two and a half years. </seg>
<seg id="136"> An internal report, but no undesirable side-effects are firmly established No precautionary measures and they don't schedule a reserve. Nothing in the annual report. </seg>
<seg id="137"> Lack of balance, jerky gait, the works. Basically, you look like you're drunk. </seg>
<seg id="138"> Roughly half a billion in revenues. </seg>
<seg id="139"> You there? </seg>
<seg id="140"> Deny. </seg>
<seg id="141"> That dumbshit wanted us to write a letter to the editor. </seg>
<seg id="142"> No way we're writing a letter. </seg>
<seg id="143"> On the other hand, if we see this is getting picked up, we could do a press release. Like somebody's spreading false rumors two weeks out from the A.S.M. kind of thing. </seg>
<seg id="144"> He's calling me back. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Ok. </seg>
<seg id="146"> - I've been so busy, I hardly had time for lunch. </seg>
<seg id="147"> - Help yourself, help yourself. </seg>
<seg id="148"> Go on. </seg>
<seg id="149"> I know I have no manners. Where were we? </seg>
<seg id="150"> We were saying it would be so much nicer if me meet some other way. </seg>
<seg id="151"> - So this cobbler, your mother, huh? - His mother. </seg>
<seg id="152"> It's my mother's recipe but Pen made it. </seg>
<seg id="153"> - Your mother doesn't use apples and pears. - No. </seg>
<seg id="154"> - She's about to have an operation, poor thing. - Really? What for? </seg>
<seg id="155"> - Her knee. </seg>
<seg id="156"> She's going to get a polythylene and metallic prostheses. </seg>
<seg id="157"> She's wondering what's going to be left of it after the cremation. </seg>
<seg id="158"> Michael, that's mean. </seg>
<seg id="159"> She doesn't want to be buried with my father. She wants to be cremated, And put upstate next to her mother, who's all alone. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A couple of urns jabbering away on the shores of Lake Sebago. </seg>
<seg id="161"> We're very touched by how generous you're being. </seg>
<seg id="162"> We realize how you're trying to smooth things out here instead of making them worse. </seg>
<seg id="163"> - Please, it's the least we could do. - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="164"> No, come on. So many parents just take their kid's side, acting like children themselves. </seg>
<seg id="165"> If Ethan had broken two of Zachary's teeth, I'm thinking Alan and I might have had more of a knee-jerk reaction. </seg>
<seg id="166"> - I'm not sure we would see the big picture. - Sure you would. </seg>
<seg id="167"> She's right. I'm not so sure. You would. Because we all know it could have happened the other way around. </seg>
<seg id="168"> So what does Zachary say? How is he experiencing this? </seg>
<seg id="169"> He doesn't talk much. A little overwhelmed I guess. </seg>
<seg id="170"> But he realizes that he disfigured his schoolmate? </seg>
<seg id="171"> No. No, he doesn't realize that he disfigured his schoolmate. </seg>
<seg id="172"> Why do you say that? Of course Zachary realizes. </seg>
<seg id="173"> He realizes that this violent behavior is unacceptable, not that he disfigured his schoolmate. </seg>
<seg id="174"> You don't like the word but unfortunately the word is appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="175"> - My son did not disfigure your son. - Your son disfigured our son! </seg>
<seg id="176"> - Come back after school, look at his mouth and teeth. </seg>
<seg id="177"> - Momentarily disfigured. - His mouth will be fine when the swelling goes down. </seg>
<seg id="178"> As for the teeth, if he needs it, we'd be willing to chip in for the best dental care. </seg>
<seg id="179"> We got insurance for that. </seg>
<seg id="180"> What we want is for the boys to patch it up, make sure nothing like this ever happens again. </seg>
<seg id="181"> - Let's set up a meeting. - Yeah. Exactly. </seg>
<seg id="182"> - Should we be there? </seg>
<seg id="183"> - They don't need coaching. Let them work it out like men. Like men? Alan, don't be rediculous. </seg>
<seg id="184"> On the other hand, maybe we don't need to be there. Maybe it's better if we weren't there, right? </seg>
<seg id="185"> The issue is not whether we are there, whether we are not there. The issue is, do they want to talk about this, do they want to work this out. </seg>
<seg id="186"> - Ethan does. - Does Zachary? </seg>
<seg id="187"> - We won't give him a choice. - It has to come from him. </seg>
<seg id="188"> Zachary acts like a thug, we're not going to wait around for him to see the light. </seg>
<seg id="189"> If Zachary sees Ethan in a punitive context, because he's forced to, I just don't see anything positive coming out of that. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Mrs. Longstreet, our son is a maniac. If you hope he'll suddenly and spontaneously get all apologetic, you're dreaming. </seg>
<seg id="191"> Look, I'm sorry, but I really do have to get back to the office. Nancy, you stay. You'll let me know what was decided. I'm no use to anyone anyway. </seg>
<seg id="192"> Women think you need the man, you need the father, like it would do any good. </seg>
<seg id="193"> I'm really sorry, but I can't stay either. </seg>
<seg id="194"> My husband has never been much of an I'll-push-the-stroller type daddy. </seg>
<seg id="195"> That's too bad, because it goes by so fast. Mike really liked taking care of the kids. </seg>
<seg id="196"> - You had a ball pushing that stroller. - Yeah, sure. </seg>
<seg id="197"> So... What should we decide? </seg>
<seg id="198"> Could you come over to our place at about 7:30, with Ethan? </seg>
<seg id="199"> - Well, if you want my opinion... - Yes, please. </seg>
<seg id="200"> - I think Zachary should come over here. </seg>
<seg id="201"> The victim shouldn't be the one who makes the trip. </seg>
<seg id="202"> - I can't be anywhere at 7:30. - Who needs you? You're useless, right? </seg>
<seg id="203"> - Seriously, I think it's important for his father to come. - Not tonight! </seg>
<seg id="204"> - Can you hear me? </seg>
<seg id="205"> There's not a word in the annual report. But the risk wasn't officially established. There's no proof. Call me back. </seg>
<seg id="206"> - Tomorrow? - Tomorrow I'm in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="207"> - You have business in Washington? - At the Pentagon. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Look, the main thing is to get the kids to talk. </seg>
<seg id="209"> I'll come over to your place with Zachary at 7:30 and we'll let them talk it through. </seg>
<seg id="210"> What? You don't seem convinced. </seg>
<seg id="211"> If Zachary hasn't acquired accountability skills, They'll just glare at each other, it will be disaster. </seg>
<seg id="212"> - "Accountability skills", Mrs. Longstreet? What are you talking about? - Zachary is not a maniac. - Yes he is. </seg>
<seg id="213"> Alan, don't be an idiot. Why are you saying that? </seg>
<seg id="214"> He's a maniac. - How does he explain what he did? - He won't talk about it. </seg>
<seg id="215"> - He should talk about it. - That's a lot of "shoulds", Mrs. Longstreet. </seg>
<seg id="216"> He should come here, he should talk about it, he should feel sorry... </seg>
<seg id="217"> I'm sure you're much more evolved than we are. </seg>
<seg id="218"> We're trying to get up to speed, but in the meantime try to indulge us. </seg>
<seg id="219"> Hey come on! What happened here? </seg>
<seg id="220"> This isn't what we are all about. - I was talking about Zachary, about him. </seg>
<seg id="221"> - I got that. Alan! </seg>
<seg id="222"> You want some more coffee? Real coffee. Coffee. </seg>
<seg id="223"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="224"> - Coffee, all right. - It's OK, I'll get it. </seg>
<seg id="225"> I see you're an art enthusiast. Yes. </seg>
<seg id="226"> - Bacon? - Yes, Bacon. </seg>
<seg id="227"> - Cruelty and splendor. - Chaos. Balance. </seg>
<seg id="228"> - Is Zachary interested in art? - Not as much as he should be. - Your children are? </seg>
<seg id="229"> - We try to make up for the lack in the school curriculum. </seg>
<seg id="230"> We try to get them to read, to concerts and galleries. </seg>
<seg id="231"> I really believe that culture can be a powerful force for peace. </seg>
<seg id="232"> Yeah you're so right. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Is cobbler cake or pie? This is an important question. </seg>
<seg id="234"> I was in the kitchen, thinking. Why should pizza be a pie? </seg>
<seg id="235"> Cobbler is cake. It there's no crust on the bottom then it can't be pie. </seg>
<seg id="236"> You're a gourmet chef. I like to cook. </seg>
<seg id="237"> It's something you have to do out of love or not at all. </seg>
<seg id="238"> The way I see it, if there's no curst on the bottom, then it's not a pie. </seg>
<seg id="239"> How about you guys? You have other kids? </seg>
<seg id="240"> I have another son by a former marriage. </seg>
<seg id="241"> You know, I was wondering. I know it's not important but... </seg>
<seg id="242"> Do you know what were they arguing about? Cause Ethan won't say a word. </seg>
<seg id="243"> Ethan wouldn't let Zachary be part of his gang. - Ethan has a gang? </seg>
<seg id="244"> - And he called him a snitch. Did you know that Ethan had a gang? </seg>
<seg id="245"> No. But I'm thrilled to hear it! </seg>
<seg id="246"> - Why are you thrilled? - Cause I had one. - I was the leader. - So was I. </seg>
<seg id="247"> What does the leader of a gang do? </seg>
<seg id="248"> You know, you got five, six guys who like you and they're willing to sacrifice themselves for you. </seg>
<seg id="249"> - Like in Ivanhoe. - Exactly, like in Ivanhoe. </seg>
<seg id="250"> Who even knows Ivanhoe any more? So it's another role model. Like Spiderman or whoever. </seg>
<seg id="251"> Well apparently you know more about it than we do. </seg>
<seg id="252"> Zachary wasn't quite as silent as you first said. </seg>
<seg id="253"> Why did he call him a snitch? </seg>
<seg id="254"> Forget it, silly question, right? What's the point? No one care. </seg>
<seg id="255"> We're not going to get into these children's quarrels. </seg>
<seg id="256"> - It's none of our business. - Right. </seg>
<seg id="257"> What is our business is this unfortunate incident. Violence is our business. </seg>
<seg id="258"> When I was the leader, I beat up Jimmy Leach in a fair fight and he was bigger than me. </seg>
<seg id="259"> - What does that do with anything, Michael? - No, nothing. </seg>
<seg id="260"> This is not a fair fight, these boys weren't fighting. </seg>
<seg id="261"> - Right, I was just remembering something. - It's not very different. </seg>
<seg id="262"> - Excuse me, I'm sorry there's a difference. - There's a difference. </seg>
<seg id="263"> What's the difference? Jimmy Leach and me, we agreed to fight. </seg>
<seg id="264"> - Did you mess him up? - A little. </seg>
<seg id="265"> Enough about Jimmy Leach. - Do you mind if I talked to Zachary? </seg>
<seg id="266"> - Of course not. - I would not do it without your permission. </seg>
<seg id="267"> - No, talk to him. That's completely fine with us. - And good luck with that. </seg>
<seg id="268"> - Stop it. Why did you say that? </seg>
<seg id="269"> - Mrs. Longstreet... - Penelope. I think we'll do better if we're on a first name basis. </seg>
<seg id="270"> - Penelope, you're acting on a desire to educate... </seg>
<seg id="271"> - I won't talk to him if you don't want me to. Go ahead, talk to him, lecture him, do whatever you want. </seg>
<seg id="272"> I don't understand how you feel so uninvolved here. </seg>
<seg id="273"> - Mrs. Longstreet... - Penelope. </seg>
<seg id="274"> Penelope, I'm very involved here. - My son injured another child... </seg>
<seg id="275"> - Deliberately. See, that's the kind of thing that irks me. We know deliberately. </seg>
<seg id="276"> That's what makes all the difference. The difference between what and what? </seg>
<seg id="277"> We're only talking about one thing here. Our kid picked up a stick and hit your kid. That's why we're here, right? </seg>
<seg id="278"> - Fruitless. - Right, she's right. This kind of talk is fruitless. </seg>
<seg id="279"> Why do you feel you need to slip in the word deliberately? What kind of lesson are you trying to teach me? </seg>
<seg id="280"> All right, this is getting silly. </seg>
<seg id="281"> My husband is all stressed out over work stuff. </seg>
<seg id="282"> I'll come back here tonight with Zachary and we'll let them work it out naturally. </seg>
<seg id="283"> - I'm not stressed out in the least. - Well I am. </seg>
<seg id="284"> - There's no reason to be stressed out. - Yes, there is. Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="285"> Well, no comment...No comment. </seg>
<seg id="286"> No comment! </seg>
<seg id="287"> What? If you recall it, you're admitting liability! </seg>
<seg id="288"> Recalling Antril would be admitting your liability! </seg>
<seg id="289"> Christmas time in the school play... - What did Zachary play? </seg>
<seg id="290"> Zachary played... - Ebenezer Scrooge. - accused of accounting irregularities... - Ebenezer Scrooge, right. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Michael, do you remember he played Scrooge? - Sure. </seg>
<seg id="292"> - He was wonderful. With that night bonnet. He was very funny. </seg>
<seg id="293"> Let's talk about it, what about the victims after the stockholders' meeting... </seg>
<seg id="294"> We can't recall a drug because three guys can't walk a straight line! </seg>
<seg id="295"> For the time being, don't make a move. </seg>
<seg id="296"> All right, call you right back. </seg>
<seg id="297"> They're in panic mode. They have the media breathing down their necks. I want a release thant doesn't sound defensive at all. Just the opposite. Go for the jugular. Something like: "TW Pharma is a target." "Attempt at manipulation of the stock two weeks before the stockholders' meeting." " Where did this study come from anyway?" "How does this suddenly drop out of a clear blue sky", etcetera. </seg>
<seg id="298"> Not one word about the health issue. Just one question: Who is behind the study? Who? </seg>
<seg id="299"> Fine. </seg>
<seg id="300"> Nobody said you should listen to my conversation. </seg>
<seg id="301"> Nobody said you should have it under my nose. </seg>
<seg id="302"> I'm totally forced to have it here. Against my will, believe me. </seg>
<seg id="303"> They just peddle this shit, right? No one is responsible. </seg>
<seg id="304"> In any therapeutic advance there are benefits and there are risks. </seg>
<seg id="305"> Yeah, I know. Still you got some funny line of work. </seg>
<seg id="306"> - What does that mean? - Michael, it's none of our business. </seg>
<seg id="307"> - Funny line of work. - What about you, what do you do? </seg>
<seg id="308"> - I got a normal job. - What's a normal job? </seg>
<seg id="309"> - I told you, I sell pots and pans. - And door handles. </seg>
<seg id="310"> And flush mechanisms. And lot of other stuff. </seg>
<seg id="311"> "Flush mechanisms", I like that, That's interesting. </seg>
<seg id="312"> Flush toilets are interesting. Why not? </seg>
<seg id="313"> - How many different kinds do you have? </seg>
<seg id="314"> - There are two basic kinds. You got your push button and your handle operated. </seg>
<seg id="315"> - Yeah, right. - Depends where your water line is. </seg>
<seg id="316"> - I see. - It either comes from the side near the top, or it comes from the bottom. </seg>
<seg id="317"> One of my store managers is an expert. I could introduce you if you want. But you'll have to hump it out to Jamaica, Queens. </seg>
<seg id="318"> You seem like you know your business pretty well. </seg>
<seg id="319"> Are you planning to sanction Zachary in any way? </seg>
<seg id="320"> - I don't feel well. - What's the matter, are you all right? </seg>
<seg id="321"> - Oh you do look pale honey. - You're all white, yeah. </seg>
<seg id="322"> - Nauseous. - Some Reglan, you get some Reglan? </seg>
<seg id="323"> - No. I'll be fine. - Coke. What you need is a coke. </seg>
<seg id="324"> It's not cold. </seg>
<seg id="325"> - It's not cold. - Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="326"> Just little sips. The coke wasn't in the refrigerator. </seg>
<seg id="327"> Have him call me back. Tell him right away. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Is Coke good for that? It's more for diarrhea, isn't it? No, not only. Better? </seg>
<seg id="329"> I think so. Mrs. Longstreet... </seg>
<seg id="330"> If we decide to reprimand our child, we'll do it in our own way and on our own terms. </seg>
<seg id="331"> - Absolutely. - What absolutely? </seg>
<seg id="332"> He's their kid, they're free to do as they see fit. </seg>
<seg id="333"> - I don't agree. - You don't agree about what, Penny? </seg>
<seg id="334"> - They're not free. - Is that right? Go on. </seg>
<seg id="335"> But don't forget, nothing has been proven here, nothing is certain. </seg>
<seg id="336"> Don't fuck this up. </seg>
<seg id="337"> If we don't get this right, Walter will be out on his ear in two weeks, and so will we. </seg>
<seg id="338"> Enough, Alan! Enough with the cell phone already! The here and now, god dammit! </seg>
<seg id="339"> Call me back and read it to me. </seg>
<seg id="340"> What the hell is wrong with you? Screaming at me like that! - Dennis heard every word! </seg>
<seg id="341"> - Good! I'm sick of that fucking cell phone, every minute of every day! </seg>
<seg id="342"> Listen Nancy, you should be thanking me for agreeing to come here... </seg>
<seg id="343"> Really? - I'm going to throw up. - No you're not. </seg>
<seg id="344"> - I am. - You want to use the bathroom? </seg>
<seg id="345"> - Nobody's forcing you to stay... - She's right, nobody's forcing you to stay. </seg>
<seg id="346"> - I'm dizzy. - Stare at a point in space. </seg>
<seg id="347"> - Hey, you can see part of the EL from here. Cool! - Get away from me. Leave me alone. </seg>
<seg id="348"> - Should she go to the bathroom? - Go to the bathroom if you have to throw up. </seg>
<seg id="349"> - Give her some Reglan. - It can't be the cobbler, can it? </seg>
<seg id="350"> - No, I made it yesterday. - Don't touch me! </seg>
<seg id="351"> - Take it easy, Doodle. - Come on, don't get all bent out of shape over nothing. </seg>
<seg id="352"> My husband feels that anything to do with the house, the school, the backyard, - ...is my domain. - I do not. </seg>
<seg id="353"> You do so. And I can understand why. It's all so excruciatingly boring. It's excruciating. </seg>
<seg id="354"> If it's so excruciating, why do you have children in the first place? </seg>
<seg id="355"> Maybe Zachary picks up on that lack of interest. </seg>
<seg id="356"> - What lack of interest?! - You just said it yourself! </seg>
<seg id="357"> Go get a bucket, go get a bucket! </seg>
<seg id="358"> That stupid bitch. </seg>
<seg id="359"> You should have gone to the bathroom. Doodle, this is rediculous. - Your suit took a hit. </seg>
<seg id="360"> - What? - It can't be the cobbler. </seg>
<seg id="361"> That much I know. - It's not the cobbler, it's nerves. This is just nerves. </seg>
<seg id="362"> You want to clean up in the bathroom? </seg>
<seg id="363"> Oh my god, my Kokoschka. </seg>
<seg id="364"> - Give her some Reglan. - She couldn't keep anything down right now. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Where's the bathroom? </seg>
<seg id="366"> I'll show you. </seg>
<seg id="367"> This is nerves, just nerves. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Like I always say, you can't get over something when you're under it. </seg>
<seg id="370"> With me it's the back of my neck. </seg>
<seg id="371"> - What do we do about the Kokoschka? - We can clean it. Try Lysol. Only problem is drying it. </seg>
<seg id="372"> Or else with plain water and you put some cologne on there. </seg>
<seg id="373"> - Cologne? - I got some of that Kronos I never use. The paper will warp. </seg>
<seg id="374"> We'll blow-dry it, then put some books on top then flatten it out. Maybe iron it like dollar bills. </seg>
<seg id="375"> - Oh God! - I'll buy you another one. </seg>
<seg id="376"> There's no other one. It's been out of print for years. </seg>
<seg id="377"> - I'm so sorry. - We can save it. Pen, let me do this. </seg>
<seg id="378"> It's a reprint from the catalog of the 1963 show in London. </seg>
<seg id="379"> Go get the blow-dryer and the cologne. It's in the bathroom cabinet. </seg>
<seg id="380"> - Her husband is in the bathroom! - He's not in the can! </seg>
<seg id="381"> I got most of it off. Little bit on the Dolgans... </seg>
<seg id="382"> Excuse me! </seg>
<seg id="383"> - Are you feeling better? - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="384"> - Should I spray? - Where's the blow-dryer? </seg>
<seg id="385"> He's drying his pants. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Well, we'll wait. We'll put the Kouros on there last. </seg>
<seg id="387"> - Can I use the bathroom too? - Yes, of course. Of course. </seg>
<seg id="388"> I don't know what to say... </seg>
<seg id="389"> I am so sorry. </seg>
<seg id="390"> Bring the blow-dryer please. </seg>
<seg id="391"> God! </seg>
<seg id="392"> Unbelievable! Un-fucking-believable. </seg>
<seg id="393"> - Her cobbler is horrible. - You stuffed your face! </seg>
<seg id="394"> Look at my day. I have to get some food in me some time. </seg>
<seg id="395"> - Oh God. - What a freaking nightmare! </seg>
<seg id="396"> He better watch it, he's got me right on the edge. - She's horrible! </seg>
<seg id="397"> - Less. She's so fake. </seg>
<seg id="398"> - She doesn't bother me that much. - They're both horrible. </seg>
<seg id="399"> Why do you take their side all the time? - Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="400"> - I don't take their side. </seg>
<seg id="401"> What the hell are we doing here? </seg>
<seg id="402"> - I hope you're kidding. - Why do you argue with her? </seg>
<seg id="403"> We'd have been out of here a long time ago if you didn't bicker over every word. </seg>
<seg id="404"> You'd rather I was a sheep, like her husband? </seg>
<seg id="405"> - You think it was the cobbler? - Of course it was. </seg>
<seg id="406"> A little warm coke and... Bang! </seg>
<seg id="407"> Fuck! </seg>
<seg id="408"> You mitigate. You're trying to reconcile everything. - I'm not! </seg>
<seg id="409"> - You are. You had your gang and you were the leader, and they can do whatever they want with their son. </seg>
<seg id="410"> Their son is a threat to homeland security. When a kid is a menace to society it's everybody's business. </seg>
<seg id="411"> I can't believe she barfed all over my books! </seg>
<seg id="412"> When you know you're going to toss your cookies, you take precautions. </seg>
<seg id="413"> Oh, the Foujita! Disgusting... </seg>
<seg id="414"> I was right on the edge with that toilet flushing shit. </seg>
<seg id="415"> - You were incredible. - I held my own, right? </seg>
<seg id="416"> Incredible. "Jamaica, Queens", that was genius. </seg>
<seg id="417"> - Little piece of shit. What does he call her again? - Doodle. - Doodle... - Doodle! Yeah, I call her Doodle. </seg>
<seg id="418"> Oh, I'm sorry. We didn't mean anything. </seg>
<seg id="419"> It's just so easy to make fun of other people's pet names. </seg>
<seg id="420"> Michael, what do we call each other? I'm sure it's worse, right? </seg>
<seg id="421"> - Here, you want the blow-dryer. - Thanks. </seg>
<seg id="422"> We call each other darjeeling, like the tea. </seg>
<seg id="423"> A lot more embarrassing if you ask me. </seg>
<seg id="424"> - How's she feeling, is she feeling better? - Yeah, better. </seg>
<seg id="425"> I reacted badly. I'm ashamed. </seg>
<seg id="426"> I made a big deal about the catalog. I didn't really know why I did that. </seg>
<seg id="427"> You get so absurdly attached to these things, you don't even know why really. </seg>
<seg id="428"> - Pull it taut. - Hold on at the other side. I know I got it, just pull it taut. - The corners are wet. - I know, I get the corners. - It's gonna tear. - He's right, it gonna tear. - Here. - It's dry now. You put colognes right now and I finish those. </seg>
<seg id="429"> - What does Doodle come from? - Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="430"> Yankee Doodle? Cheese Doodle? </seg>
<seg id="431"> No, it's a song from Guys and Dolls that goes, "Doodle oodle oodle oo." </seg>
<seg id="432"> Oh yeah, I know that one. </seg>
<seg id="433"> Ours is from our honeynoon in India. </seg>
<seg id="434"> I called her darjeeling instead of darling. So stupid. </seg>
<seg id="435"> - Should I go check on her? - Go ahead, darjeeling. </seg>
<seg id="436"> Nancy! I was worried about you, all better? </seg>
<seg id="437"> Yeah, better, I think so. If you're not sure, stay away from the coffee table. </seg>
<seg id="438"> I left the towel in the bathtub. I didn't know where to put it. </seg>
<seg id="439"> Perfect. </seg>
<seg id="440"> You cleaned up? I'm so sorry. Everything is fine. All is well. </seg>
<seg id="441"> I'm sorry, I wasn't there for you. I was so focused on my Kokoschka. </seg>
<seg id="442"> That's all right. - No, I behaved poorly. - Please. </seg>
<seg id="443"> In the bathroom I was thinking. </seg>
<seg id="444"> Yes? </seg>
<seg id="445"> Maybe we glossed over the... </seg>
<seg id="446"> - Well I mean... - What? What is it? </seg>
<seg id="447"> - Name-calling is a kind of abuse. - Sure. </seg>
<seg id="448"> - Depends. - Right, depends. </seg>
<seg id="449"> Zachary has never been a violent child. He must have his reasons. </seg>
<seg id="450"> Like getting called a snitch. Excuse me. </seg>
<seg id="451"> Yeah, Walter. </seg>
<seg id="452"> As long as there are no victims on the panel. No victims. I don't want you sitting down with victims. </seg>
<seg id="453"> Deny, deny, deny. If we have to, we'll sue the Journal. </seg>
<seg id="454"> We'll e-mail you the draft of the press release, Walter, I'm sorry I got to go. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Call me a snitch, it gets a rise out of me. </seg>
<seg id="456"> - Unless it's ture. - What? </seg>
<seg id="457"> You know, the shoe fits. </seg>
<seg id="458"> - You think my son is a snitch? - Come on, joking around. </seg>
<seg id="459"> - So is yours anyway. - What do you mean so is ours? </seg>
<seg id="460"> - He snitched on Zachary. - We coaxed it out of him. </seg>
<seg id="461"> - We're completely off point here. - Maybe you coaxed, but he did snitch on him. </seg>
<seg id="462"> - Nancy... - Nancy what? - You think my son is a snitch? </seg>
<seg id="463"> - I don't think anything. Well if you don't think anything, don't say anything. Don't make insinuations. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Nancy, there's no reason to lose our cool here. </seg>
<seg id="465"> Michael and I have gone out of our way to be fair-minded and conciliating... </seg>
<seg id="466"> - Not so fair-minded. - Oh, really? </seg>
<seg id="467"> - Superficially fair-minded. - Doodle, I have to go. </seg>
<seg id="468"> So go, coward. </seg>
<seg id="469"> Nancy, right now I'm in danger of losing my most important client. </seg>
<seg id="470"> So this caring parent crap and the brickering that goes along with it... </seg>
<seg id="471"> - My son lost two teeth. Two incisors. - Yeah, right, we got that. </seg>
<seg id="472"> - One of them permanently. - He'll get new teeth. Better ones! </seg>
<seg id="473"> No one chewed his ear off! </seg>
<seg id="474"> It was a mistake not to consider the source of the problem. </seg>
<seg id="475"> There is no source. There's an 11-year-old kid who hits people, with a stick! </seg>
<seg id="476"> - Armed with a stick. - We took that word out. </seg>
<seg id="477"> - You took it out because we asked you to. - We took it out without argument. </seg>
<seg id="478"> A word which deliberately establishes intent and excludes any hint of a misunderstanding. </seg>
<seg id="479"> Which excludes childhood. </seg>
<seg id="480"> - I don't think I can stand this tone any more. - We're not quite on the same page, you and I. Right from the start. </seg>
<seg id="481"> Mr. Cowan, it is incredibly frustrating to be continued upbraided For something we ourselves admitted was a mistake. </seg>
<seg id="482"> Like the word "armed" wasn't right, we took it out. Strictly speaking, it certainly applies. </seg>
<seg id="483"> Zachary was verbally abused and over reacted. If I'm attacked, I defend myself. Especially when I'm all alone against a whole gang. </seg>
<seg id="484"> Well, you've certainly perked up since you tossed your cookies. Do you realize how crude that is? </seg>
<seg id="485"> We're all decent people. All four of us. How do we get all carried away, losing our tempers? </seg>
<seg id="486"> It's totally unnecessary. Michael, stop, stop metigating. </seg>
<seg id="487"> We're only superficially fair-minded, why should we be fair-minded at all? </seg>
<seg id="488"> - I'm not going to be led down that path. The path those two little shits led us down! </seg>
<seg id="489"> - I'm afraid Pen doesn't see things that way... - Penelope. - Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="490"> - So Ethan is a shit now. That really takes the cake. </seg>
<seg id="491"> - That's it. I really have to leave now. - Yeah so do I. </seg>
<seg id="492"> Go, go. I give up. </seg>
<seg id="493"> Hello? </seg>
<seg id="494"> Oh, hi Ma. No, we got some friends over but go ahead. </seg>
<seg id="495"> Yes, you just do whatever the doctors tell you to do. </seg>
<seg id="496"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="497"> The what? </seg>
<seg id="498"> Antril? You're taking Antril... Hold on a second. </seg>
<seg id="499"> Antril? That crap of yours, is that Antril? </seg>
<seg id="500"> - My mother's taking it. - Thousands of people take it. </seg>
<seg id="501"> Mum, you stop taking that one immediately. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Do what I tell you, I'll explain later. </seg>
<seg id="503"> Mum, you tell Dr. Perlstein that I won't let you take it. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Good. </seg>
<seg id="505"> Why red? So who can see you? </seg>
<seg id="506"> Mum, that's rediculous. Mum... </seg>
<seg id="507"> I have to call you back I told you I have company. </seg>
<seg id="508"> OK. I love you. Bye-bye. </seg>
<seg id="509"> She got red crutches so she won't hit by a truck. In case she wanders out on the street at night. </seg>
<seg id="510"> They're giving her Antril for her blood pressure. </seg>
<seg id="511"> If she's taking it and she looks normal, I'll take her deposition. </seg>
<seg id="512"> Didn't I have a scarf? I don't like that attitude of yours. </seg>
<seg id="513"> If my mother has the slightest symptom, my name will be at the top of a class-action suit. </seg>
<seg id="514"> - We'll have one anyway. - I should hope so! </seg>
<seg id="515"> Doing the right thing is futile. Honesty is just stupidity. All it does is weaken you. You let your guard down. </seg>
<seg id="516"> OK, let's go Nancy. That's enough sermons and lectures for one day. </seg>
<seg id="517"> Go ahead, go. But let me tell you this, now that I know you two, I'm not surprised </seg>
<seg id="518"> What's his name? Zachary, may have behaviour issues. </seg>
<seg id="519"> - When you killed that hamster... - Killed? </seg>
<seg id="520"> - Killed. - I killed the hamster? </seg>
<seg id="521"> Yes. You do everything you can to make us feel guilty. You stake out the moral highground as your own, but you yourself are a murderer. </seg>
<seg id="522"> I definitely did not kill the hamster. Worse. You left it out there, Trembling with fear in a hostile environment. That poor critter was probably eaten by a dog or a rat. </seg>
<seg id="523"> - She's right about that. - What do you mean she is right? I mean it's horrible, what must have happened to that animal! I thought the hamster would be happy to be free. I was sure he'd go running around in the gutter, happy as a clam! You just left him there! </seg>
<seg id="524"> I can't touch those things, OK? I can't touch anything of that family. - Christ, Penny you know that! - He's afraid of rodents. Yeah, I have a fear of rodents. </seg>
<seg id="525"> And I have a fear of reptiles. Anything down close to the ground, that's it, all right? What about you? How come you didn't go downstairs and get it? Because I didn't know! </seg>
<seg id="526"> Michael said this morning the hamster ran away. So I went right out, I went all the way around the block. I went to the basement! </seg>
<seg id="527"> Penelope, it is completely unfair that all of a sudden I'm in the hot seat about this hamster thing. That you just had to tell them about. That's a family issue. </seg>
<seg id="528"> That doesn't concern anybody but us and it's got nothing to do with this situation here! And I can't believe I'm getting called a murderer in my own house! </seg>
<seg id="529"> - What does your house have to do with the price of tea in China? - My house! I opened the door! The door is wide open in a spirit of reconciliation. To people who should be a little grateful! </seg>
<seg id="530"> Keep right on stroking your own ego, It's beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="531"> - So you have no remorse? - I have no remorse. That animal was disgusting and I'm glad it's gone. </seg>
<seg id="532"> - Michael, that's ridiculous. - What's rediculous? What, have you lost your mind too? </seg>
<seg id="533"> Their son beats the shit out of Ethan and you're in my face over a hamster? </seg>
<seg id="534"> What you did with that hamster was wrong and you can't deny that. - I don't give a shit about the hamster! </seg>
<seg id="535"> - You'll have to give a shit tonight when your daughter get home. </seg>
<seg id="536"> Bring her on! I'm not going to be told how to act by a 9-year-old snotnose brat! </seg>
<seg id="537"> Now I agree with him there, one hundred percent. </seg>
<seg id="538"> - That's pathetic. - Watch it, Penelope, watch it. </seg>
<seg id="539"> I've kept my shirt on up till now, but you're pushing me over a line. </seg>
<seg id="540"> - And Ethan? - What about Ethan? - Is he sad too? </seg>
<seg id="541"> - Ethan's got other things on his plate, if you ask me. - Ethan wasn't so attached to Nibbles. </seg>
<seg id="542"> - Nibbles? What kind of pussy name is that anyway? </seg>
<seg id="543"> If you feel no remorse, why should our son? </seg>
<seg id="544"> You know what? All this consultation and consideration shit. </seg>
<seg id="545"> I'm sick to death of it. We were nice to you. We bought tulips. My wife dressed me up as a liberal, but the fact is I got no patience for this touchy-feely bullshit. - And I'm a temperamental son of a bitch. - We all are. </seg>
<seg id="546"> No, I'm sorry. We are not all temperamental sons of bitches. </seg>
<seg id="547"> - Not you, of course. - No, not me! Thank God! Not you, darjee, not you. </seg>
<seg id="548"> You're so evolved. You never go off half-cocked. </seg>
<seg id="549"> - Why are you being so aggressive with me? - I'm not being aggressive. I'm being honest. </seg>
<seg id="550"> Yes, you are being aggressive! You put this little bash together and I let you recruit me... </seg>
<seg id="551"> - You let me recruit you? - Yes. That's so disgusting. </seg>
<seg id="552"> No, it's not. You're an advocate for civilized behavior, well that's fine with me. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Yes I'm advocate for civilized behavior, you bet I am! And it's a good thing somebody is! </seg>
<seg id="554"> You think it's better to be a son of a bitch? </seg>
<seg id="555"> Nobody said that, nobody critisized you that! - You did! </seg>
<seg id="556"> - We did not. What was I supposed to do? Was I supposed to sue you? </seg>
<seg id="557"> Never talk to you and tear you to pieces through the insurance company? </seg>
<seg id="558"> - Stop it, Penny. - Stop what?! - You're blowing this all out of proportion. - I don't care! </seg>
<seg id="559"> You do everything you can to avoid the pettiness and you wind up Humiliated and completely alone! </seg>
<seg id="560"> Yes, Walter. Well, let them prove it. Prove it! </seg>
<seg id="561"> From where I sit, the best thing for us to do... We're born alone and we die alone! Who wants a little Scotch? </seg>
<seg id="562"> Walter, I'm in a meeting right now. I'll call you when I get back to the office. That's the thing. I'm living with a totally negative person. </seg>
<seg id="563"> - Who's negative? - Me. </seg>
<seg id="564"> This was the worst possible idea! We should never have had this meeting. </seg>
<seg id="565"> - I told you so. - You told me so? Yeah! - You told me we should never have this meeting? </seg>
<seg id="566"> - I didn't think it was a very good idea. - It was a good idea. </seg>
<seg id="567"> - Oh come on. Who wants a little? You told me you think it wasn't a good idea? </seg>
<seg id="568"> - As I recall. - As you recall! - Maybe just a little slip. </seg>
<seg id="569"> - Don't you have to go? At this point in the game, I may as well have a little drink. </seg>
<seg id="570"> You tell me again we didn't both agree on this! </seg>
<seg id="571"> Calm down, Penelope, this is going nowhere. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Who said not to touch the cobbler this morning? Who said we should keep the rest for the Cowan's? Who said that?! </seg>
<seg id="573"> That was very nice of you. - What's that to do with anything? - What do you mean what's that to do with anything? </seg>
<seg id="574"> - Guests are guests. - You're lying, you're lying! </seg>
<seg id="575"> You know, my wife actually had to drag me here today. </seg>
<seg id="576"> When you grow up with a certain John Wayne idea of manhood, The impulse in this kind of situation is not to talk it through. </seg>
<seg id="577"> - I thought the role model was Ivanhoe. - Same basic concept. - Another aspect. - Another aspect! Just how much are you going to humiliate yourself? </seg>
<seg id="578"> I can see I dragged him here for nothing. </seg>
<seg id="579"> - What did you expect, Doodle? - That is a ridiculous nickname. </seg>
<seg id="580"> Some revelation about universal values? This scotch is unbelievable. </seg>
<seg id="581"> See that? 18 years old, single malt, from a tiny place in Scotland where they still grow their own barley. </seg>
<seg id="582"> What about the tulips? Who got them? </seg>
<seg id="583"> All I said was it's too bad we didn't get any tulips. </seg>
<seg id="584"> I never said anything about going all the way up to Henry street at dawn. </seg>
<seg id="585"> Don't get all bent out of shape over this, Penelope, It's not worth it. </seg>
<seg id="586"> He got the tulips! Him and only him! </seg>
<seg id="587"> Don't we get a drink? </seg>
<seg id="588"> Penelope and I would like a drink too. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Pretty funny when you think about it. </seg>
<seg id="590"> A devotee of Ivanhoe and John Wayne but he's scared to pick up an itty-bitty mouse. </seg>
<seg id="591"> - Stop the hamster. Stop. - She's right, it's laughable. </seg>
<seg id="592"> - And her? - I don't think that will be necessary. </seg>
<seg id="593"> - Pour me a drink, Michael. - No. - Michael! - No. </seg>
<seg id="594"> What is wrong with you, Michael? Fine, fine. Drink, What does it matter? </seg>
<seg id="595"> - Is drinking bad for you or something? - No, no, it's great for me. </seg>
<seg id="596"> Now I don't know... </seg>
<seg id="597"> - Mr. Cowan... - Alan. Alan... </seg>
<seg id="598"> See, you and I didn't exactly hit it off I live with a man who has decided once and for all that life is synonymous with mediocrity. </seg>
<seg id="599"> It's very hard to live with a man who's walled himself up in that idea, who doesn't want to change anything, who never gets excited about anything... </seg>
<seg id="600"> What are you telling this for? He could care less. </seg>
<seg id="601"> You have to believe, you have to believe some possible correction. </seg>
<seg id="602"> He's the last guy on earth you should be telling this to. </seg>
<seg id="603"> I'll talk to anyone I damn well please! </seg>
<seg id="604"> Who the fuck is that now? </seg>
<seg id="605"> Mother. Hi, Ma. </seg>
<seg id="606"> He's fine. He got his teeth knocked out but he's fine. </seg>
<seg id="607"> He's in pain, it hurts, it'll pass. </seg>
<seg id="608"> Ma, I told you I have company. I'll call you back, remember? Yeah, bye. </seg>
<seg id="609"> - He's still in pain? - No. </seg>
<seg id="610"> - Then why do you worry your mother? - He has to worry, he can't help himself. </seg>
<seg id="611"> Ok, Penelope, that's enough. What is this drama queen bullshit? </seg>
<seg id="612"> Penelope, nobody cares about anything outside himself. </seg>
<seg id="613"> Sure, we'd all like to believe in some kind of possible correction, One we could author ourselves, completely free of selfish consideration. Like you're writing this book about Darfur... Which is great! </seg>
<seg id="614"> I understand how you might say, OK, I'll pick a massacre, History is full of them, and I'm going to write a book. </seg>
<seg id="615"> Everybody has to save himself somehow. I'm not writing this book to save myself. </seg>
<seg id="616"> You haven't read it, you don't even know what's in it! Whatever. </seg>
<seg id="617"> The smell of Kronos is killing me. </seg>
<seg id="618"> - It fucking reeks! - You didn't exactly skimp. - I'm so sorry. - It's my fault. I sprayed like a madwoman. Why can't things be easier? </seg>
<seg id="619"> Why does everything have to be so exhausting? </seg>
<seg id="620"> You think too much. Women think too much. </seg>
<seg id="621"> There's an original response? I don't know what that means, to think too much. </seg>
<seg id="622"> And I don't understand how you can go on living without some moral sense of the world. </seg>
<seg id="623"> Look at me, I'm living! Michael, shut up. </seg>
<seg id="624"> Miserable complicity! Just disgusting. </seg>
<seg id="625"> - What happened to your sense of humor? - I don't have a sense of humor, and I don't want one. </seg>
<seg id="626"> If you ask me, the couple is the most terrible ordeal God ever inflicted on us. </seg>
<seg id="627"> Ah, marvelous. - The couple and the family. </seg>
<seg id="628"> - No one is forcing you to air this out in front of us, Michael. And I might add, it's a little indecent. </seg>
<seg id="629"> - That doesn't bother him. - You agree with me, don't you? </seg>
<seg id="630"> Look, this is all, beside the point. </seg>
<seg id="631"> - Alan, say something. - He has a right to his ideas. </seg>
<seg id="632"> - That doesn't mean he has to advertise them. - Yeah, maybe. </seg>
<seg id="633"> We don't care about their marriage. </seg>
<seg id="634"> We're here about a problem with the kids. We don't care about their marriage. </seg>
<seg id="635"> - Yes, except... - Except what? </seg>
<seg id="636"> - It's related. - Of course it's related. </seg>
<seg id="637"> Ethan's getting two of his teeth broken is related to our marriage? </seg>
<seg id="638"> - Of course it is. - Sorry I don't follow you. </seg>
<seg id="639"> Take a step back and look at the situation we're in. </seg>
<seg id="640"> Chrldren suck the life out of you and leave us old and empty. It's the law of nature. You see these young couples, laughing all the way to the alter. You think they don't know. Poor fuckers have no idea. They're happy. Nobody tells y ou this stuff in the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="641"> I get this army buddy of mine is going to have a kid with his new girlfriend. </seg>
<seg id="642"> I say to him, "A kid at our age? what are you stupid?" </seg>
<seg id="643"> "You got ten, fifteen good years left before you get cancer or have a stroke," "and you're gonna saddle yourself with a fucking kid?" </seg>
<seg id="644"> - That's not really what you think. - Yes it is. - Of course it's what I think, even worse. </seg>
<seg id="645"> - Yeah, you're debasing yourself, Michael. </seg>
<seg id="646"> Is that right? Stop crying, Penelope. Makes it worse. </seg>
<seg id="647"> Of course, of course. </seg>
<seg id="648"> - Excellent, isn't it? - So excellent. - Could I interest you in a cigar? </seg>
<seg id="649"> - No cigars in the house! - Too bad. </seg>
<seg id="650"> - Were you going to smoke a cigar now, Alan? </seg>
<seg id="651"> I do what I want, Nancy. If I want to smoke a cigar, I smoke a cigar. </seg>
<seg id="652"> I won't smoke it because I don't want to upset Penelope, Who's already on edge, to put it mildly. </seg>
<seg id="653"> Oh, quit snuffling like that, she's right. </seg>
<seg id="654"> When women cry, men are pushing to their breaking point. </seg>
<seg id="655"> Although unfortunately, I must say that Michael's point of view is completely justified. </seg>
<seg id="656"> Yeah. Yeah, sure, go ahead. </seg>
<seg id="657"> Put "New York" and a specific time of day. It's unbearable! </seg>
<seg id="658"> The time you send it. It has to be hot off the press. </seg>
<seg id="659"> No, not "questions". "Deplores". Questions is wishy-washy. </seg>
<seg id="660"> I live with this night and day. - One second. </seg>
<seg id="661"> - Our lives are chopped up by the cell phone. - Nancy, this is very important. </seg>
<seg id="662"> - It's always very important. What's happening somewhere else is always more important. </seg>
<seg id="663"> Not "strategy". "Scheme". A scheme surfacing two weeks from the company's posting. In the street. At the dinner table. Everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="664"> "A study" in quotes. Put the word "study" in quotes. </seg>
<seg id="665"> I don't even protest anymore. Unconditional surrender. </seg>
<seg id="666"> - I feel like I'm going to vomit again. - Where's that bucket? How am I supposed to know? </seg>
<seg id="667"> Then just quote me. </seg>
<seg id="668"> - Can you stand over the bucket please? - Pen! It's all right. We're set up to handle this now. </seg>
<seg id="669"> ...according to TW Pharma attorney Alan Cowan. AP, Reuters, major newspapers, trade journals, the whole shebang. </seg>
<seg id="670"> - What's wrong? - She's gonna throw up again. </seg>
<seg id="671"> - You're so caring, it's touching. - I'm worried. </seg>
<seg id="672"> I didn't get that, my mistake. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Oh come on Nancy, will you? You and I don't have to do this. </seg>
<seg id="674"> Their marriage is going downhill, we don't have to try to compete with them. </seg>
<seg id="675"> What gives you the right to say our marriage is going downhill? </seg>
<seg id="676"> Yeah, Walter. </seg>
<seg id="677"> Yeah, I just had it read back. They're sending it over to you. Manipulation. Manipulation of the stock price. Walter, I'll call you back in a minute. - I didn't say it. Steven did. </seg>
<seg id="678"> - Michael. - I won't let you judge our family. - Then don't judge our son either. </seg>
<seg id="679"> That's different! Your son brutalized our son! </seg>
<seg id="680"> They're young, they're kids, kids roughhouse in the playground. Always have always will, it's a rule of nature. - No it isn't! - Sure it is. </seg>
<seg id="681"> It takes a little education to substitute the rule of law for violence. </seg>
<seg id="682"> The origin of law, of course you know, is brute force. </seg>
<seg id="683"> Maybe for cavemen, not in this world. - Tell me about this world! </seg>
<seg id="684"> - Boring! This conversation is boring. </seg>
<seg id="685"> Penelope, I believe in the god of carnage. The god whose rule has been unchallenged since time immemorial. </seg>
<seg id="686"> You're interested in Africa, right? </seg>
<seg id="687"> - What's the matter? - Don't worry about me. </seg>
<seg id="688"> - Nancy! - I'm just fine. </seg>
<seg id="689"> See, I just got back from the Congo. They got kids there, trained to kill at the age of eight. In the course of their childhood, they might kill hundreds of people. They'll kill with a machete, a shotgun, a Kalash, a thumper. </seg>
<seg id="690"> So obviously when my kid busts some other kid's tooth, even two teeth, with a bamboo switch by the sandbox, I'm not quite as shocked and indignant as you are. </seg>
<seg id="691"> - Well you should be. - Thumper. - Yes, that's why they call a grenade launcher. </seg>
<seg id="692"> - That's what I call it. - You all right? - Just fine. </seg>
<seg id="693"> - What's wrong with her? - It's bile, nothing. </seg>
<seg id="694"> Don't you tell me about Africa! I know all about suffering in Africa. </seg>
<seg id="695"> I don't doubt it. That's all I've been thinking about for months! </seg>
<seg id="696"> Don't get her started on this, please! </seg>
<seg id="697"> - You know I'm actually starting to like you. - Shut up! </seg>
<seg id="698"> - Talk about commitment to world peace and stability. - Shut the fuck up, Michael! </seg>
<seg id="699"> - You sure about that? - Very sure. Do me some good. </seg>
<seg id="700"> We live in New York. We don't live in Kinshasa! We live in New York City! </seg>
<seg id="701"> With the customs of western society. What happens in a Brooklyn playground is about western values! To which, like it or not, I happen to subscribe. </seg>
<seg id="702"> Beating your husband must be one of those customs then... </seg>
<seg id="703"> - I'm warning you, Michael! - She was all over you like a bad rash! </seg>
<seg id="704"> - If I were you it would melt my heart. </seg>
<seg id="705"> - He's making fun of you, do you believe it? I don't care about this... </seg>
<seg id="706"> No, really. Morally, we're supposed to overcome our impulses but there are times you don't want to overcome them. </seg>
<seg id="707"> I mean, who wants to say a "Hail Mary" when having sex? </seg>
<seg id="708"> - Can you buy this scotch around here? - No, this very likely no. </seg>
<seg id="709"> Thumper! </seg>
<seg id="710"> - Thumper, really. - Yeah. Thumper. So it is called. </seg>
<seg id="711"> - Why don't you just say grenade launcher? - Because it's a term. </seg>
<seg id="712"> Just like they say "kalash" and not Kalashnikov or AK-47. </seg>
<seg id="713"> - Who is they? - That's enough, Nancy, that's enough. </seg>
<seg id="714"> Hotshot firebrands like my husband, you got to understand, It's hard for them to get excited about what happens down the block. </seg>
<seg id="715"> Exactly. I don't see why. I don't see why. </seg>
<seg id="716"> We're all citizens of the world. I don't see why we shouldn't have some sense of community. </seg>
<seg id="717"> Penelope, enough for the highfalutin clap trap! </seg>
<seg id="718"> I'm gonna kill him. Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="719"> She's right! It's unbearable after a while. </seg>
<seg id="720"> "Brazen". a brazen attempt to... There you go. </seg>
<seg id="721"> He sighed off the rest? Sure. </seg>
<seg id="722"> What were we talking about? Thumpers? </seg>
<seg id="723"> We were saying that, dispite my husband thinks, Whether it happens here or other parts of the world, we must be collectively concerned. "Collectively concerned". </seg>
<seg id="724"> Nancy, it's absurd to drink in your condition. </seg>
<seg id="725"> What condition? I'm perfect. </seg>
<seg id="726"> That's interesting... Yeah? </seg>
<seg id="727"> No, no interviews before we get this release out. </seg>
<seg id="728"> Mr. Cowan, would you please put an end to this nerve-racking conversation? </seg>
<seg id="729"> No way. The stockholders won't give a shit. The stockholders... </seg>
<seg id="730"> Nancy what are you... Are you out of your fucking mind? </seg>
<seg id="731"> - There. - Shit! - Oh my god. - Way to go! </seg>
<seg id="732"> - The blow-dryer! - What is wrong with you? </seg>
<seg id="733"> I can't believe this! I got everything in there. It's brand new, I spent hours setting it up! </seg>
<seg id="734"> I can't believe you did that. That was an irresponsible thing to do. </seg>
<seg id="735"> My whole life was in there! </seg>
<seg id="736"> Take out the battery and SIM card. How to do that? </seg>
<seg id="737"> I just got it, I don't know! They thikn it's funny, they think it's funny! Penelope, it's not funny! </seg>
<seg id="738"> My husband has spent the entire afternoot drying thing! - Forget it. It's over. - You gotta wait. </seg>
<seg id="739"> You want to use the phone? I must say... </seg>
<seg id="740"> What...What must you say, Michael? </seg>
<seg id="741"> No, I don't even know what to say. </seg>
<seg id="742"> I'd say it feels better like this, wouldn't you? </seg>
<seg id="743"> Men get so attached to their toys. It diminishes them. They lose their credibility. I liked this guy once and then I saw him carrying this rectangular bag. ut with a shoulder strap. A man's bag, but with a shoulder strap! It was over! </seg>
<seg id="744"> A bag with a shoulder strap, that's the worst. But the cell phone always at his fingertips is the worst, too. </seg>
<seg id="745"> A man should have both hands free. </seg>
<seg id="746"> I've got a John Wayne idea of manhood, too. </seg>
<seg id="747"> What was it he had? A Colt '45. Something that empties a room... </seg>
<seg id="748"> Any man that doesn't give off those loner vibes just doesn't come off as having any substance... </seg>
<seg id="749"> So Michael, I guess you are happy now. </seg>
<seg id="750"> Our touchy-feely-whatever you said is coming apart at the seams. But you know what? This almost feels good. In my opinion. </seg>
<seg id="751"> Yeah, well in my opinion, some people can hold their liquor better than others. </seg>
<seg id="752"> - I'm as normal as I can be. - Yeah, right. </seg>
<seg id="753"> I'm beginning to see things with a pleasant serenity. </seg>
<seg id="754"> That's good! "A pleasant serenity"! </seg>
<seg id="755"> I can't understand why you're wasting yourself, right out in the open, darjeeling. </seg>
<seg id="756"> - Shut the hell up. - Alan, relax. </seg>
<seg id="757"> - No cigars in the house! - Hoyo de Monterrey. Partagas D number4, you got your Hoyo Coronation. </seg>
<seg id="758"> - Where did you get these? - You don't want to know. - Seriously. - The Spanish connection. My cookware guy. His best friend is going with a flight attendant. Brings in like two boxes a week. </seg>
<seg id="759"> You can't smoke in a house with an asthmatic child! And why are you telling him your whole life story? </seg>
<seg id="760"> - Who has asthma? - Our son. - We had a goddamn hamster, didn't we? </seg>
<seg id="761"> - It's true that pets aren't good when you're asthmatic. </seg>
<seg id="762"> - Not good at all! - Even goldfish aren't necessarily recommended. </seg>
<seg id="763"> Do I have to listen to this crap? </seg>
<seg id="764"> I guess I'm the only one who doesn't see things with pleasant serendity. </seg>
<seg id="765"> The truth is, I've never been so unhappy. Unhappiest day of my life. </seg>
<seg id="766"> You're an unhappy drunk. </seg>
<seg id="767"> Michael, every word out of your mouth just slays me. </seg>
<seg id="768"> I don't get drunk. I had a sip of your shitty 18-year old single malt... that you trot out like it's the 18 wonder of the world. </seg>
<seg id="769"> I don't get drunk, and believe me I wish I could. It would be such a relief to drown every little sorrow in a good stiff drink. </seg>
<seg id="770"> My husband is unhappy, too. </seg>
<seg id="771"> Look at him. All hunched over. Like he was left on the side of the road. </seg>
<seg id="772"> I think this is the unhappiest day of his life, too. </seg>
<seg id="773"> - It is! - I'm sorry, Doodle. </seg>
<seg id="774"> Hello? </seg>
<seg id="775"> Hello? </seg>
<seg id="776"> Mum! I told you I have company, remember? </seg>
<seg id="777"> Because it's medication thant can kill you! It's poison! </seg>
<seg id="778"> Mum, someone here who can explain. </seg>
<seg id="779"> - Here! Tell her! - Tell her what? </seg>
<seg id="780"> Tell her what you know about that poison shit of yours. </seg>
<seg id="781"> What can he tell her? He doesn't know anything. </seg>
<seg id="782"> Hello, ma'am, how are you? </seg>
<seg id="783"> No... Are you in pain? </seg>
<seg id="784"> Yeah...the operation will fix that. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The other leg too, huh? </seg>
<seg id="786"> No, I'm not an orthopedist. She keeps calling me doctor. </seg>
<seg id="787"> Doctor, what a laugh! Hang up! </seg>
<seg id="788"> Yeah! Do you have any balance issues? </seg>
<seg id="789"> No, of course not, not at all. It can't kill you. Don't listen to what people say. </seg>
<seg id="790"> It's probably a good idea not to take it for a while. Just until this operation is behind you. </seg>
<seg id="791"> Yes, sounds like you're in excellent shape. You got that Ma? You stop taking that medication! </seg>
<seg id="792"> Do as a told, all right? I love you. </seg>
<seg id="793"> I can't take her anymore. </seg>
<seg id="794"> - The shit I put up with. - All right, should we wrap this up? </seg>
<seg id="795"> Should I come back tonight with Zachary? Let's decide. </seg>
<seg id="796"> This is getting to be like, who cares? That is what we're here for, after all. </seg>
<seg id="797"> Now I'm going to be sick. Where's that bucket? </seg>
<seg id="798"> That's enough! </seg>
<seg id="799"> I'd say both sides share the blame. There you are, both sides share the blame. </seg>
<seg id="800"> - Are you serious? - Excuse me? </seg>
<seg id="801"> - That's what you really think? - It's what I think, yes. </seg>
<seg id="802"> My son Ethan, who took codeine last night at three in the morning, he shares the blame? </seg>
<seg id="803"> He's not necessarily innocent. </seg>
<seg id="804"> Get out my house. Get the fuck out of my house! </seg>
<seg id="805"> My bag! What is going on here? They're totally lost it. </seg>
<seg id="806"> - Alan, do something! - "Alan, do something" </seg>
<seg id="807"> Shut your mouth! She broke my make-up mirror and my perfume! </seg>
<seg id="808"> Stand up for me. Why don't you stand up for me? </seg>
<seg id="809"> - Let's go, Nancy. - It's not like I'm strangling her! </seg>
<seg id="810"> - What did I do to you? </seg>
<seg id="811"> - The blame is not shared! The victim and the criminal are not the same! </seg>
<seg id="812"> - The criminal?! - Oh give it a fucking rest, Penelope! Enough of these idealistic theories shit! </seg>
<seg id="813"> - Which I believe in. - You believe, you believe! </seg>
<seg id="814"> This crush you got on these Sudan sambos is spilling over into everything now! </seg>
<seg id="815"> I am horrified. How can you be so openly despicable? </seg>
<seg id="816"> Because I feel like it. I feel like being openly despicable. </seg>
<seg id="817"> One day you'll understand the sheer horror of what's happening in that part of the world, And you'll be ashamed of you inability to take action, of your contemptibly nihilistic attitude. </seg>
<seg id="818"> Yes, darjeeling, you're so wonderful! - You're the best and the brightest! - Yes I am! Yes I am! </seg>
<seg id="819"> Let's get out of here Alan. These people are monsters. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - Stop it, Nancy. - No, no. I want to drink some more. I want to get drunk off my ass. </seg>
<seg id="821"> This bitch throws my bag against a wall and nobody lifts a finger. </seg>
<seg id="822"> - I want to be blink drunk! - You're drunk enough. </seg>
<seg id="823"> How can you let her call our son a criminal? </seg>
<seg id="824"> We came over here to work things out... They insult us, browbeat us, they lecture us about being good citizens of the planet. </seg>
<seg id="825"> I'm glad our son kicked the shit out of your son, And I wipe my ass with your human rights! </seg>
<seg id="826"> A little booze and bang! Her true self comes out. </seg>
<seg id="827"> What happened to that gracious, demure woman with the soft eyes... </seg>
<seg id="828"> - I told you, I told you! - What did you tell him? </seg>
<seg id="829"> That she was fake. This women is totally fake. I'm sorry. </seg>
<seg id="830"> - When exactly did you say that? - When you were drying your pants! </seg>
<seg id="831"> You had known her 15 minutes and you already knew she was a fake? </seg>
<seg id="832"> - I pick up on these things in people very quickly. - She does. - I just have a nose for it. </seg>
<seg id="833"> - Fake, what does that mean? I don't want to listen to this. Why do you put me through this, Alan? </seg>
<seg id="834"> Relax, Nancy... </seg>
<seg id="835"> She's a complete phony. She doesn't care any more than you do. </seg>
<seg id="836"> It's true. - He said it's true. - They don't give a shit! </seg>
<seg id="837"> It's obvious from the beginning, they don't give a shit. </seg>
<seg id="838"> - She doesn't give a shit either. - Like you do? </seg>
<seg id="839"> Let him talk, honey. Explain to me, Michael, exactly how you care. What does that mean anyway? You're more credible when you're being openly despicable. </seg>
<seg id="840"> Truth is, nobody here cares. Except maybe Penelope. One must acknowledge her integrity. </seg>
<seg id="841"> I don't need your acknowledgment! I don't need your acknowledgment! </seg>
<seg id="842"> But I do care. I really do care. </seg>
<seg id="843"> Yes Doodle we care in a hysterical way, Not like heroic figures of a social movement. </seg>
<seg id="844"> I saw your friend Jane Fonda on TV the other day. </seg>
<seg id="845"> Made me want to run out and buy a Ku Klux Klan poster. </seg>
<seg id="846"> My friend Jane Fonda? What the hell does that mean? </seg>
<seg id="847"> You're the same breed. You're the same kind of involved, problem-solver woman. </seg>
<seg id="848"> Those are not the women we like. The women we like are sensual, crazy, shot full of hormones. </seg>
<seg id="849"> The gatekeepers of the world, the ones who want to show off how perceptive they are, Huge turnoff. </seg>
<seg id="850"> Even poor Michael, your own husband is turned off... Don't you speak for me. </seg>
<seg id="851"> We don't give a shit about what women you like! </seg>
<seg id="852"> Where do you get off spouting these opinions? </seg>
<seg id="853"> You're one man whose opinions we don't give a shit about! </seg>
<seg id="854"> She is screaming. A quartermaster on a slave ship. </seg>
<seg id="855"> What about her? She doesn't scream? She didn't just scream that your little asshole was right to beat up ours? </seg>
<seg id="856"> He was right! At least our kid isn't a little wimpy-ass faggot! Yours is a fucking snitch! </seg>
<seg id="857"> Let's go Alan, why are we still in this house? </seg>
<seg id="858"> Here, this is what I think of these stupid tulips! Your hideous flowers! </seg>
<seg id="859"> Worst day of my life, too. </seg>

<seg id="10"> I love coffee. </seg>
<seg id="11"> What do you do? </seg>
<seg id="12"> You know, I just relax, sit around, maybe have a cigarette. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Cigarettes and coffee I think go together good. </seg>
<seg id="14"> You think you drink too much of it? </seg>
<seg id="15"> No. Coffee is good for health. </seg>
<seg id="16"> I like to drink before I go to sleep. </seg>
<seg id="17"> I drink a lot of coffee before I go to sleep so I can dream faster. </seg>
<seg id="18"> I can dream like when they put a camera on the Indy 500... when they put a camera in the car, and it's just whipping by like that. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Dream after dream after dream after dream. </seg>
<seg id="20"> People ask me the next day, what did you dream about? </seg>
<seg id="21"> I say, I don't have time. I don't have time to tell you this. </seg>
<seg id="22"> - Do you smoke? - Only when I drink coffee. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Do you know my mother? </seg>

<seg id="26"> - Coffee. They should freeze it, you know? - Yes. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Fill an ice-cube tray with coffee and put sticks in it, for kids. </seg>
<seg id="28"> So they can start when they're kids, when they're playing and stuff. Like a Popsicle. A caffeine Popsicle. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Very good. I don't understand nothing. Yes. </seg>
<seg id="30"> - Can you hear me? - What? </seg>
<seg id="31"> Can you hear me? It's very loud over here. </seg>

<seg id="43"> I gotta go, I guess. </seg>
<seg id="44"> - Yes. - I haven't gone in a while. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Good. You don't go? </seg>
<seg id="46"> - I should go, but I don't feel like going. - No? </seg>
<seg id="47"> I am free, very free. </seg>
<seg id="48"> You wanna go for me? </seg>
<seg id="49"> Thank you very much. </seg>
<seg id="50"> - You wanna go to the dentist? - Yes, I can go for you. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Great. </seg>

<seg id="54"> - The name of the guy. - Yeah, 4:30. </seg>
<seg id="55"> - Steven, thank you very much. - No problem. </seg>
<seg id="56"> - You don't mind? - No, thank you. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Dentist appointment, very good. </seg>
<seg id="58"> I have to go. I am sorry, Steve. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Steve, I have to go to the dentist. I am late. </seg>
<seg id="60"> - Thank you, excuse me. Sorry. - Take it easy, don't be late. </seg>
<seg id="61"> - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too, in a way. </seg>
<seg id="62"> What are we doing in Memphis, anyway? </seg>
<seg id="63"> - It was your idea to come here. - Your idea. </seg>
<seg id="64"> It was my idea? It was your idea. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Very funny. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Don't smoke those sawdust cigarettes in here. </seg>
<seg id="67"> I hate those things. </seg>
<seg id="68"> - So what? - What are you, a cowboy? </seg>
<seg id="69"> - These are fresh. This is fresh tobacco. - No, this is fresh. </seg>
<seg id="70"> - This is the stupid dope fresh cigarettes. - That stuff is stale. What are you, crazy? </seg>
<seg id="71"> - I'm not crazy. - Shut up. </seg>
<seg id="72"> How we doing here? Need a refill? </seg>
<seg id="73"> - Yeah. - No. </seg>
<seg id="74"> - Sir? - Yes. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Shit. I'm sorry. </seg>
<seg id="76"> - Come on, what are you doing, man? - Damn, I'm sorry about that. </seg>
<seg id="77"> Let's not even pay the check. This place is terrible. </seg>
<seg id="78"> This all you're gonna have? </seg>
<seg id="79"> - Give me a light. - Just coffee and cigarettes? </seg>
<seg id="80"> That's not too healthy, is it now? </seg>
<seg id="81"> - Can I get you a sandwich or something? - No. </seg>
<seg id="82"> - Y'all from around here? - No. </seg>
<seg id="83"> Are you brother and sister? </seg>
<seg id="84"> - Yes. - No. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Are you two twins? </seg>
<seg id="86"> - Yes. - No. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Yes, we are. </seg>
<seg id="88"> I thought so. You know who y'all remind me of? </seg>
<seg id="89"> - Who? - Heckle and Jeckle. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Shit. </seg>
<seg id="91"> You know, the talking magpies? </seg>
<seg id="92"> Anyway, who's the evil twin? That's the way it works, right? </seg>
<seg id="93"> - This coffee tastes like mud. - Really. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Which one of us do you think looks like the evil one? </seg>
<seg id="95"> I'd say he's the evil one, right? He's got the evil eye. </seg>
<seg id="96"> - I'm only kidding. - You better be. </seg>
<seg id="97"> You know, I just thought of something, with you two being twins and all. </seg>
<seg id="98"> - Did y'all go to Graceland yet? - No. </seg>
<seg id="99"> You should. It's real cool. </seg>
<seg id="100"> - Mind if I sit down? - Yes, I do. </seg>
<seg id="101"> Yes, you can sit down. What are you, on a break? </seg>
<seg id="102"> Not really, but it's kind of slow. Tell you what, you can help me out. </seg>
<seg id="103"> Just stay right there. You got me covered and my boss can't see me. </seg>
<seg id="104"> It's his evil nature, right? </seg>
<seg id="105"> Anyway, what I just thought of, </seg>
<seg id="106"> do you know that Elvis Presley's got a twin brother? </seg>
<seg id="107"> Yeah, his name is Jesse Garon. You know, Elvis' middle name is Aaron. </seg>
<seg id="108"> Aaron, Garon. Anyway, everybody thinks that he died at birth. </seg>
<seg id="109"> But my theory is... </seg>
<seg id="110"> that his mother didn't wanna raise two kids. She wasn't expecting twins. </seg>
<seg id="111"> She couldn't afford to raise both. </seg>
<seg id="112"> She gave one away. </seg>
<seg id="113"> She just sent one off. So Jesse grew up in Arkansas, or Mississippi, or something. </seg>
<seg id="114"> So he didn't know he had a brother, Elvis. But one day, like, 1968 or '69... </seg>
<seg id="115"> he's looking at himself in the mirror and says, "Damn, I look like Elvis". </seg>
<seg id="116"> So he comes to Memphis, looks up Elvis. </seg>
<seg id="117"> Elvis sees him, he says, "Yeah, you're my brother. I can't believe it!" </seg>
<seg id="118"> "How you doing? What can I do for you?" </seg>
<seg id="119"> And his brother says, "Well, I don't know". </seg>
<seg id="120"> "Sure would be nice to be you for one night." </seg>
<seg id="121"> So Elvis had this concert where his brother sang. </seg>
<seg id="122"> They tried to see if they could trick people. Damn if he didn't sound like his brother! </seg>
<seg id="123"> Then Elvis had an idea. </seg>
<seg id="124"> I'm tired of the music scene. I'll send him out on tour. </seg>
<seg id="125"> Big mistake, because it was his brother who started to go to Vegas... </seg>
<seg id="126"> and wear them big collars, the white jumpsuits, and the capes. </seg>
<seg id="127"> Elvis wouldn't do that. And it was his brother who got really fat. </seg>
<seg id="128"> You know, eating those banana-fried butter sandwiches and all. </seg>
<seg id="129"> The Colonel said, "We gotta get rid of this guy. He can't be Elvis anymore." </seg>
<seg id="130"> So they started feeding him pills. I think they killed him. </seg>
<seg id="131"> So what? What are you saying? What's the punch line? </seg>
<seg id="132"> - Y'all are Elvis fans? - No. </seg>
<seg id="133"> You wanna hear something about Elvis? I'll tell you something about him. </seg>
<seg id="134"> - You ever heard of Otis Blackwell? - No, ma'am. </seg>
<seg id="135"> - You ever heard of Junior Parker? - No, ma'am. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Yeah, I didn't think so. You know, Elvis robbed their music, man. </seg>
<seg id="137"> He paid them $10 for their music, and all these other black musicians, too. </seg>
<seg id="138"> - That's what I think of Elvis. - Here's where my theory fits. </seg>
<seg id="139"> I don't think it was Elvis. I think it was his brother. </seg>
<seg id="140"> So in that case, it's all right? </seg>
<seg id="141"> My favorite Elvis quote is, "The only thing colors can do for me is shine my shoes". </seg>
<seg id="142"> I don't think the King said that. See, I think it was his evil twin. </seg>
<seg id="143"> Danny, what you doing over there? You got tables to wait on. Come on. </seg>
<seg id="144"> - I'll be right back. - Yeah, don't get fired, man. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Slaphappy hillbilly. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Cheers. </seg>
<seg id="147"> Something smells funny in here. </seg>
<seg id="148"> Is that my shirt you got on? </seg>
<seg id="149"> No, I don't think so. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Yeah, I think it is. This doesn't smell like me. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Yeah? What do you smell like? </seg>
<seg id="152"> I smell like me, and this doesn't smell like me. </seg>
<seg id="153"> - I smell like me, too. - But this smells like you. </seg>
<seg id="154"> That's because I am me. </seg>
<seg id="155"> Is that my shirt? </seg>
<seg id="156"> - Why you always copying me, anyway? - I'm not copying you. </seg>
<seg id="157"> - Why don't you get your own style? - I have my own style. </seg>
<seg id="158"> No, you're always copying me. Your style is my style because you copy it. </seg>
<seg id="159"> - It's my style. - No, it's not your style. </seg>
<seg id="160"> Service is bad, the coffee is bad, the music sucks. </seg>
<seg id="161"> Those are my shoes. </seg>
<seg id="162"> - These are my shoes. - Those are my shoes. </seg>
<seg id="163"> - These are my shoes. - Those are my other shoes. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Bullshit. </seg>
<seg id="165"> - Hey. - Hey, Tom. </seg>
<seg id="166"> - All right. - I'm glad you could make it. </seg>
<seg id="167"> You are here. </seg>
<seg id="168"> You know, you can call me Jim. </seg>
<seg id="169"> I mean, you know, my friends call me Jim, or Jimmy, or Iggy, or Jiggy. </seg>
<seg id="170"> Call me Iggy. </seg>
<seg id="171"> Okay, all right, whichever way you go. I'll go either way, Jim or Iggy... </seg>
<seg id="172"> You call me Iggy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Look, I'm sorry I'm late, Jim. Boy, four-car pileup. </seg>
<seg id="174"> I delivered a baby this morning at about 9:00. </seg>
<seg id="175"> I was saving lives, I was out there on the highway, it was... </seg>
<seg id="176"> You know, there's nothing worse than roadside surgery. </seg>
<seg id="177"> You don't have your own tools, and it's just... It's murder. </seg>
<seg id="178"> I performed a tracheotomy with a ballpoint pen and... </seg>
<seg id="179"> I've been busy. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Wait a minute. You're a doctor? </seg>
<seg id="181"> Yeah, I'm a doctor. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Music and medicine, really. It's really been my thing. </seg>
<seg id="183"> It's combining the two and living in that place where they overlap. </seg>
<seg id="184"> A lot of people say it shows up in the music. I don't know. I mean, it's... </seg>
<seg id="185"> Well, okay. Yeah, I can see that. </seg>
<seg id="186"> Yeah, okay. I think the organization and the whole thing... </seg>
<seg id="187"> - The humanity, I guess. - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="188"> - The humanity of the thing. The regard. - Yeah, the regard. </seg>
<seg id="189"> - I guess it's a big day for you, then. - It is. It was a medical morning. </seg>
<seg id="190"> - Everybody's all right? - Everybody's fine. </seg>
<seg id="191"> You've been here a while, I see. </seg>
<seg id="192"> I've been here. Drinking a little coffee. </seg>
<seg id="193"> - Yeah, I see. - I ordered you some. </seg>
<seg id="194"> You ordered for me? </seg>
<seg id="195"> I mean, is it cool? Is that cool? </seg>
<seg id="196"> Yeah, okay. Coffee, yeah. </seg>
<seg id="197"> - I could go for a coffee. - Okay, man. </seg>
<seg id="198"> Come on, have some coffee. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Okay, coffee it is. </seg>
<seg id="200"> Are those your cigarettes? </seg>
<seg id="201"> No, they were just sitting here when I got here. </seg>
<seg id="202"> - You don't smoke, do you? - No. I gave it up. </seg>
<seg id="203"> - Not for me, either. - Boy, enough of that. </seg>
<seg id="204"> That was enough, 25 big ones. </seg>
<seg id="205"> - Finished. </seg>
<seg id="206"> - Got the energy now. </seg>
<seg id="207"> Since I quit, I mean, just everything... </seg>
<seg id="208"> Yeah, you're focused. </seg>
<seg id="209"> - Zeroed in. Bang, you know? - Me, too. </seg>
<seg id="210"> I feel sorry for suckers still puffing away, you know? </seg>
<seg id="211"> - No willpower. - No willpower. Pacifier. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Silly. You know, the beauty of quitting is, now that I've quit... </seg>
<seg id="213"> I can have one. Because I've quit. </seg>
<seg id="214"> I mean, it's just like jewelry. </seg>
<seg id="215"> You know, it's not really... I don't even inhale. </seg>
<seg id="216"> You want to join me in one? </seg>
<seg id="217"> Yeah, since I quit. Okay. </seg>
<seg id="218"> - Now that you've quit, you can have one. - Sure, yeah. </seg>
<seg id="219"> I can do that. All right. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Boy, thank you. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Yeah, you know what I mean? Now that we've quit... </seg>
<seg id="222"> Cigarettes and coffee, man. </seg>
<seg id="223"> That's a combination. </seg>
<seg id="224"> Can't beat it. </seg>
<seg id="225"> We're really the coffee-and-cigarettes generation, when you think about it. </seg>
<seg id="226"> You know what I mean? In the '40s, it was the pie-and-coffee generation. </seg>
<seg id="227"> Like Abbott and Costello on TV, man. They always wanted pie and coffee. </seg>
<seg id="228"> Yeah, like Abbott and Costello. They were always ordering pie and coffee. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Have some coffee. Have some pie and coffee. </seg>
<seg id="230"> What are you waiting for? </seg>
<seg id="231"> You hang out here a lot? </seg>
<seg id="232"> This is my hangout. </seg>
<seg id="233"> I just wondered, 'cause I didn't see anything of yours on the jukebox. </seg>
<seg id="234"> If you don't like it here, we could go down to Taco Bell or something. Maybe that's more your style. </seg>
<seg id="235"> What are you saying, man? You're saying I'm a Taco Bell kind of guy? </seg>
<seg id="236"> No. I mean, if you don't like it here. - You said you don't like it here. </seg>
<seg id="237"> - No, I didn't say that. </seg>
<seg id="238"> We could go to the International House of Pancakes. </seg>
<seg id="239"> Maybe that's more up your alley. I don't know. </seg>
<seg id="240"> I didn't say that. I don't wanna go to the International House of Pancakes. </seg>
<seg id="241"> I'm comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="242"> Coffee is good, though, at IHOP. </seg>
<seg id="243"> You like the coffee down there at IHOP? </seg>
<seg id="244"> I drink the coffee at IHOP. I like the coffee. You don't like it? </seg>
<seg id="245"> Yeah, man. I like the IHOP coffee. </seg>
<seg id="246"> - Classy brew. - Yeah, that's good coffee. </seg>
<seg id="247"> Yeah, that's good coffee at the IHOP. </seg>
<seg id="248"> I almost forgot. Listen. </seg>
<seg id="249"> I worked with this drummer the other day in LA. </seg>
<seg id="250"> And this guy, man, his name is Giant Robo. </seg>
<seg id="251"> He was clanging and banging really hard. Man, I thought of you. </seg>
<seg id="252"> Maybe you want to... This is somebody, I think you ought to check him out. </seg>
<seg id="253"> You mean, you think I need a professional drummer? I'm not good enough? </seg>
<seg id="254"> What are you talking about? </seg>
<seg id="255"> No, but I'm just... You know, it's a musician. </seg>
<seg id="256"> I thought... I just wanted to tell you about this guy. It'd be great, man. </seg>
<seg id="257"> It's hard and industrial, and he's beating, and I just thought, "wow". </seg>
<seg id="258"> What are you trying to tell me? I need a drummer? </seg>
<seg id="259"> I could use a drummer? </seg>
<seg id="260"> The drumming on my records sucks? What are you saying? </seg>
<seg id="261"> Forget it, man. </seg>
<seg id="262"> You know what? - I think I really got to get going. </seg>
<seg id="263"> - You got to go? </seg>
<seg id="264"> Maybe another cup? Maybe another cigarette? </seg>
<seg id="265"> Boy, I'd like to. No. I really gotta go. I mean... </seg>
<seg id="266"> My wife, she's alone in a motel. </seg>
<seg id="267"> Maybe we could call her up, come on down here. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Have a cup of coffee and a couple of cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="269"> She doesn't smoke. You know, it's the willpower. </seg>
<seg id="270"> - I see. - I don't want to start her. </seg>
<seg id="271"> No, you don't want to get her started. </seg>
<seg id="272"> - This is our little thing here. - Yeah, right. </seg>
<seg id="273"> But we can just sort of... We can just keep zipping along, you know. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I'll be thinking of you. </seg>
<seg id="275"> - Gotta go. - I guess so. </seg>
<seg id="276"> - See you soon. - Yeah, okay. </seg>
<seg id="277"> I wish you could stay a little longer. </seg>
<seg id="278"> - We were just starting to get going here. - Gotta go. </seg>
<seg id="279"> Okay, Jim. </seg>
<seg id="280"> - Next time. - Okay, next time. </seg>
<seg id="281"> - You take care. - You take care, too. </seg>
<seg id="282"> He's not on here, either. </seg>
<seg id="283"> - You're a fucking moron, you know that? - Now what? </seg>
<seg id="284"> I can't believe that you're still smoking those fucking things. </seg>
<seg id="285"> Vinny, they'll fuck you up. They'll kill you. Believe me. </seg>
<seg id="286"> Were you put on this fucking earth to annoy me? </seg>
<seg id="287"> You said you were gonna quit. Instead, you spend a fortune. </seg>
<seg id="288"> So those big tobacco companies can get fucking rich. And then you get cancer. </seg>
<seg id="289"> And then the fucking doctors and the hospitals, they can get rich. </seg>
<seg id="290"> And the undertakers, too. </seg>
<seg id="291"> All because you want to smoke like a fucking moron. </seg>
<seg id="292"> I can't help it. I'm fucking addicted, okay? </seg>
<seg id="293"> So, coffee and cigarettes? </seg>
<seg id="294"> That's your lunch? That ain't healthy, is it? </seg>
<seg id="295"> You're drinking coffee so don't break my fuckin' balls. </seg>
<seg id="296"> Vinny, I had lunch already. </seg>
<seg id="297"> So I'm on a diet, okay? Jesus! </seg>
<seg id="298"> Here comes my freaking kid. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Do me a favor. Don't tell your mother, please. </seg>
<seg id="300"> What the fuck am I talking about? She smokes like a locomotive, anyway. </seg>
<seg id="301"> How you doing, Junior? </seg>
<seg id="302"> - He don't talk much, does he? - Not lately. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Lately he's been the silent type. </seg>
<seg id="304"> I gave you $10 last night. So what did you do with it? </seg>
<seg id="305"> I just gave you $5. </seg>
<seg id="306"> Listen, I'll give you $1 more. That's it. </seg>
<seg id="307"> Can I at least get a hug? For $6, can I get a freaking hug? </seg>
<seg id="308"> $10 for a hug? You gotta be out of your freaking mind. All right, come here. I'll give you. </seg>
<seg id="309"> You better go get yourself something to eat, and something good. </seg>
<seg id="310"> Yeah, just like him. Get some coffee and cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="311"> Oh, brother! What the fuck are you talking about? </seg>
<seg id="312"> Look how much coffee you're drinking. </seg>
<seg id="313"> You got the whole fucking pot over there with you. </seg>
<seg id="314"> So what? They always bring me a whole pot. </seg>
<seg id="315"> I like coffee. Keeps me going. </seg>
<seg id="316"> It keeps you going, all right. You're a fucking maniac. A caffeine maniac. </seg>
<seg id="317"> - You're drinking coffee, ain't you? - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="318"> - So? </seg>
<seg id="319"> - So maybe you should try to quit. </seg>
<seg id="320"> - I ain't no fucking quitter. - I'll drink to that. </seg>
<seg id="321"> Fucking moron. Shit, here comes my kid again. </seg>
<seg id="322"> How much did you spend? </seg>
<seg id="323"> And that's all you got for $4? Peas and something to drink for $4? </seg>
<seg id="324"> - What the heck is in that bag? - It's those Chinese peas. </seg>
<seg id="325"> They're not? </seg>
<seg id="326"> They're Japanese? </seg>
<seg id="327"> Chinese, Japanese. Same thing. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Try one. </seg>
<seg id="329"> Jesus Christ! Tastes like black pepper. </seg>
<seg id="330"> Give me those. </seg>
<seg id="331"> Little bastard. Did you see that? He tried to fucking poison me. </seg>
<seg id="332"> No, he didn't, Joe. Listen to me. Those things are very expensive. </seg>
<seg id="333"> They're like a delicacy. A refined taste. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Refined taste, my ass. </seg>
<seg id="335"> Jesus Christ, not again. </seg>
<seg id="336"> I can't even light a fucking cigarette around here without getting busted. </seg>
<seg id="337"> You know something? You really are a fucking moron. </seg>
<seg id="338"> I'm gonna get to those big tobacco companies... and I'm gonna thank them when they put you in the fucking ground. </seg>
<seg id="339"> And did I ever tell that you're like a fucking wife that I don't need? </seg>
<seg id="340"> Can't fucking enjoy a cigarette. </seg>
<seg id="341"> Excuse me, miss. Can I get you some more coffee? </seg>
<seg id="342"> I really wish you hadn't done that. </seg>
<seg id="343"> I had it the right color, the right temperature. It was just right. </seg>
<seg id="344"> Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Hi. </seg>
<seg id="346"> Sorry. Sorry about the coffee. </seg>
<seg id="347"> - Does your name happen to be Gloria? - No. </seg>
<seg id="348"> 'Cause I thought maybe you... You're not friends with... </seg>
<seg id="349"> Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="350"> So can I get you something else? </seg>
<seg id="351"> A sandwich? Something to eat along with your coffee? </seg>
<seg id="352"> It's not a very healthy lunch, just the coffee and cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="353"> It's not my lunch, okay? </seg>
<seg id="354"> Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="355"> Alex. </seg>
<seg id="356"> You startled me. </seg>
<seg id="357"> How are you, Isaach? </seg>
<seg id="358"> Okay? Very well. </seg>
<seg id="359"> I'm happy to see you. </seg>
<seg id="360"> I was so sick of being in Paris. You can't imagine. </seg>
<seg id="361"> Sit down. </seg>
<seg id="362"> So, I was happy to get your call. </seg>
<seg id="363"> So long time we didn't see each other. </seg>
<seg id="364"> - I ordered you some coffee, okay? - Yeah, sure. Thanks. </seg>
<seg id="365"> So, everything is okay? </seg>
<seg id="366"> Everything is okay. Very good. </seg>
<seg id="367"> I am fine. </seg>
<seg id="368"> So, are you sure that everything is okay with you? </seg>
<seg id="369"> Everything is okay. </seg>
<seg id="370"> And you? </seg>
<seg id="371"> Me? Things are okay. </seg>
<seg id="372"> Not perfect, you know, but pretty much okay. </seg>
<seg id="373"> Good. I'm very happy to see you. </seg>
<seg id="374"> I'm happy to see you, man. </seg>
<seg id="375"> It's just that since I didn't see you for so long... </seg>
<seg id="376"> and you called to say you wanted to see me, I thought maybe something was wrong. </seg>
<seg id="377"> No. I just wanted to see you, that's all. </seg>
<seg id="378"> Me too, man. I wanted to see you too. </seg>
<seg id="379"> Are you sure there's nothing you want to tell me? - Nothing bothering you? </seg>
<seg id="380"> - But why? </seg>
<seg id="381"> - Do you want something to be wrong? - Not at all. </seg>
<seg id="382"> When I got your call, I had an intuition that something was bothering you. </seg>
<seg id="383"> Something maybe you need to talk about. That's all, man. </seg>
<seg id="384"> Isaach, there is nothing wrong. Really. </seg>
<seg id="385"> Okay? </seg>
<seg id="386"> Are you sure? </seg>
<seg id="387"> Are you crazy, Isaach? </seg>
<seg id="388"> Are you sure you have nothing... </seg>
<seg id="389"> you know, to let out? </seg>
<seg id="390"> Should I invent something bad? I could invent something bad for you. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Not at all. No. I don't want you to invent something. </seg>
<seg id="392"> You know, I'm your best friend. </seg>
<seg id="393"> You should feel completely free to tell me the truth. </seg>
<seg id="394"> To tell me whatever is bothering you. </seg>
<seg id="395"> Cut the shit. </seg>
<seg id="396"> Okay, I understand. That's cool. </seg>
<seg id="397"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="398"> No problem. </seg>
<seg id="399"> Isaach, no problem. </seg>
<seg id="400"> I guess I'm gonna go. </seg>
<seg id="401"> Really? So soon? </seg>
<seg id="402"> Yeah, you know, man... if you don't want to talk to me about it, I don't want to be a problem. </seg>
<seg id="403"> There is no problem, Isaach. Don't you understand? No problem. </seg>
<seg id="404"> I understand. But listen... </seg>
<seg id="405"> if you don't want to talk now, call me anytime, okay? </seg>
<seg id="406"> Now maybe it's not the right time for you, that's all. </seg>
<seg id="407"> So, I was very happy to see you. </seg>
<seg id="408"> Yes, me too. </seg>
<seg id="409"> I'm sorry to disappoint you, but there is nothing wrong. Really. </seg>
<seg id="410"> It's okay. </seg>
<seg id="411"> I do understand. </seg>
<seg id="412"> No. You don't understand. </seg>
<seg id="413"> Call me. </seg>
<seg id="414"> See you, Isaach. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Soon. </seg>
<seg id="416"> - Hi, so nice to see you. - You too. </seg>
<seg id="417"> It's been ages. </seg>
<seg id="418"> Last time, what? A couple of years ago in Sydney, wasn't it? </seg>
<seg id="419"> Really, was that two years ago? </seg>
<seg id="420"> How are Jeff and Beryl? </seg>
<seg id="421"> You know, same old, same old. </seg>
<seg id="422"> Still stuck in their odd little parental ways. </seg>
<seg id="423"> So you're not with Mr. Cate and the baby on this trip? </seg>
<seg id="424"> No. Unfortunately, I'm by myself. I'll see them next week. </seg>
<seg id="425"> Everyone's good? Yeah, I want a baby. At some point. </seg>
<seg id="426"> - What can I get for you? - What are you having, Catie? </seg>
<seg id="427"> Can I have an espresso, please? In a large cup? </seg>
<seg id="428"> Yeah, I'll have an espresso too, thanks. A double. </seg>
<seg id="429"> And can I have some hot milk on the side? And could you heat it? </seg>
<seg id="430"> - I think we can manage that. - Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="431"> I'm sorry I'm late. I know you haven't got a lot of time. </seg>
<seg id="432"> Don't worry about it. I just wish I could stay here longer. </seg>
<seg id="433"> Do you stay here overnight, or do you just do your press stuff here? Your junket. </seg>
<seg id="434"> No, I stay overnight and I do the interviews here too. </seg>
<seg id="435"> I just think it's easier. They do the interviews in my suite upstairs. </seg>
<seg id="436"> They're setting up for the next interview... and I just thought maybe it would be nicer if we met down here. </seg>
<seg id="437"> No, thanks, Shell. You're not... </seg>
<seg id="438"> Go on. They're not going to stop you smoking. </seg>
<seg id="439"> - There you go, cous'. - Thanks. </seg>
<seg id="440"> So you mean they give you this full-on hotel suite... and they also use it for your publicity? </seg>
<seg id="441"> Seems kind of cheap. </seg>
<seg id="442"> Well, it's a suite. So they just divide up the room. </seg>
<seg id="443"> Yeah, but why couldn't they get you a suite... and get another suite to do your press in? </seg>
<seg id="444"> It's pretty low-budget, this thing I did. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Yeah, still. </seg>
<seg id="446"> It's pretty cheap, man. </seg>
<seg id="447"> Can I get you anything else? </seg>
<seg id="448"> - No, thanks. That's great. - You're welcome. </seg>
<seg id="449"> Kind of weird getting in here. I almost didn't... until they found out I was your cousin. </seg>
<seg id="450"> There're some photographer, paparazzi guys hanging out front. </seg>
<seg id="451"> I guess they kind of follow you around, right? </seg>
<seg id="452"> You know, whatever so-called celebrities are around, I suppose. </seg>
<seg id="453"> God, that must be a real fucking drag sometimes, right? </seg>
<seg id="454"> I mean, not like me. I'm free. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Practically broke, but I'm completely free. </seg>
<seg id="456"> No one's stalking me, that's for fucking sure. </seg>
<seg id="457"> Except when they thought I was you. </seg>
<seg id="458"> I got into this club once because they thought I was you. </seg>
<seg id="459"> Then they found out I wasn't and asked me to leave. </seg>
<seg id="460"> Pretty fucking rude. </seg>
<seg id="461"> Don't get me wrong. I mean, it must be fabulous. You got it all. </seg>
<seg id="462"> You got a good husband, beautiful baby. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Travel all over the world, stay in fancy hotels. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Parties... </seg>
<seg id="465"> You know what they say, the grass is always greener. </seg>
<seg id="466"> So, how's... </seg>
<seg id="467"> Shit. </seg>
<seg id="468"> - Johnny. - Who? </seg>
<seg id="469"> Jimmy. Tommy. Sorry. How is he? </seg>
<seg id="470"> We broke up almost two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Tommy, yeah. What a dickhead. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Got a new boyfriend now. Lee. Remember? </seg>
<seg id="473"> He's in a band. Wrote you about him. </seg>
<seg id="474"> He's a pretty huge part of my life. </seg>
<seg id="475"> Sorry, Shell, I don't think you did. </seg>
<seg id="476"> Yeah, I even sent you his fucking CD. </seg>
<seg id="477"> Your assistant probably didn't give it to you. </seg>
<seg id="478"> It's okay. It's totally cool. I mean, I know how busy your life is. </seg>
<seg id="479"> - Do you remember where you sent it? - No. I mean, one week you're in LA... </seg>
<seg id="480"> then you're in London, then you're in Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="481"> I mean, you're in a different fucking city every day of the week. </seg>
<seg id="482"> I'd love to hear the music. What does it sound like? </seg>
<seg id="483"> It's really... </seg>
<seg id="484"> kind of hard... </seg>
<seg id="485"> and it's industrial, kind of throbbing... </seg>
<seg id="486"> I don't think you'd get it. </seg>
<seg id="487"> - What are they called? - They're called Sqürl. </seg>
<seg id="488"> Squirrel. </seg>
<seg id="489"> No, Sqürl. You know, like they say it here. </seg>
<seg id="490"> S-Q-U-R-L, with an umlaut over the "U". Sqürl. </seg>
<seg id="491"> Sqürl. I get it. Right. </seg>
<seg id="492"> So can I buy the CD until I find the one you sent? </seg>
<seg id="493"> No, not yet. They recorded it independently, you know, so... </seg>
<seg id="494"> But I think the record company's gonna put it out finally. </seg>
<seg id="495"> I think. </seg>
<seg id="496"> I'm gonna have to find that CD so I can listen to it. </seg>
<seg id="497"> You're not gonna find it. </seg>
<seg id="498"> Shell, that isn't fair, actually. </seg>
<seg id="499"> - It's true. You're not gonna find it. - Really? </seg>
<seg id="500"> I fucking know you're not. 'Cause I just remembered... I didn't actually send it to you. </seg>
<seg id="501"> I think I just thought about sending it to you. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Almost forgot. This is for you. </seg>
<seg id="503"> Thanks. What is it? </seg>
<seg id="504"> This is really expensive stuff. It must have cost hundreds. </seg>
<seg id="505"> Cool, thanks. I could use this stuff. </seg>
<seg id="506"> Make me look like a movie star, right? </seg>
<seg id="507"> - Cheers. - Cheers, gorgeous. </seg>
<seg id="508"> Seriously, Catie, thanks for seeing me. </seg>
<seg id="509"> No, thanks for seeing me. </seg>
<seg id="510"> And thanks for all the fancy swag. </seg>
<seg id="511"> It's nothing. </seg>
<seg id="512"> It is swag, isn't it? </seg>
<seg id="513"> They probably give you all kinds of free stuff... jewelry, clothes. Probably give you cars, right? </seg>
<seg id="514"> No, they don't give me cars. They sometimes give me makeup, from time to time. But I just thought... I don't know, I just wanted... </seg>
<seg id="515"> Didn't have time to go shopping. </seg>
<seg id="516"> No, really, it's fine. I mean, it's great. I can use it. </seg>
<seg id="517"> It's just funny, don't you think? When you can't afford something, it's really expensive. </seg>
<seg id="518"> And then when you can afford it, it's free. </seg>
<seg id="519"> Kind of backward, don't you think? </seg>
<seg id="520"> The world's a bit like that, I guess, in a lot of ways. </seg>
<seg id="521"> Speaking of paparazzi... </seg>
<seg id="522"> I saw these photos of you the other day in the tabloids. </seg>
<seg id="523"> Don't tell me that. Yuck. </seg>
<seg id="524"> What was I wearing? </seg>
<seg id="525"> Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="526"> Hello? Hi, Lindsey. </seg>
<seg id="527"> I'm downstairs, in the coffee room with my cousin Shelly. </seg>
<seg id="528"> It's already... </seg>
<seg id="529"> Okay, yeah. I'll be up in a minute. Bye. </seg>
<seg id="530"> - Got to get back to work? - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="531"> Back to the grind? </seg>
<seg id="532"> Do you want to come up to the room? </seg>
<seg id="533"> It won't be very interesting, but you're welcome to come up. </seg>
<seg id="534"> What, and watch you do TV interviews and stuff? </seg>
<seg id="535"> Like Entertainment Tonight? </seg>
<seg id="536"> Maybe you can send me that CD, or a letter, or something. </seg>
<seg id="537"> - Yeah, but you wouldn't read it. - Stop it. I would if you actually sent it. </seg>
<seg id="538"> I've really gotta go. Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="539"> It was great seeing you. Have you got my numbers? </seg>
<seg id="540"> Take care. Send my love to everyone. </seg>
<seg id="541"> Yeah, send my love to everyone on your end. </seg>
<seg id="542"> If they even remember me. </seg>
<seg id="543"> - Bye, Catie. - See you, Shell. </seg>
<seg id="544"> Put that on my room and anything else she wants. </seg>
<seg id="545"> - Maybe next time I'll get to meet Lou. - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="546"> It's Lee. </seg>
<seg id="547"> Excuse me. </seg>
<seg id="548"> Can I have a tequila? Thanks, a double, and the menu. </seg>
<seg id="549"> I'm sorry, there's no smoking in the lounge. </seg>
<seg id="550"> So, Jack, you going to tell me about your tesla coil? </seg>
<seg id="551"> You said you didn't want to hear about it. </seg>
<seg id="552"> Yeah, but that was a while ago. </seg>
<seg id="553"> I don't know if I want to talk about it. </seg>
<seg id="554"> Come on, Jack. You dragged it all the way down here in your little red wagon. </seg>
<seg id="555"> Come on, just tell me about it. </seg>
<seg id="556"> I built it based on the inventor Nikola Tesla's original designs. </seg>
<seg id="557"> It's an air transformer... with primary and secondary coils that are tuned to resonate. </seg>
<seg id="558"> It's basically a step-up transformer... which converts relatively low-voltage high current to high-voltage low current... at high frequencies. </seg>
<seg id="559"> Do you remember... when we were kids, you had a little Barbie makeup mirror? </seg>
<seg id="560"> Yeah, I remember that. </seg>
<seg id="561"> It had a little fluorescent light on it? </seg>
<seg id="562"> Nikola Tesla invented fluorescent light. </seg>
<seg id="563"> Without him, we wouldn't have alternating current... radio, television, x-ray technology... induction motors, particle beams, lasers. </seg>
<seg id="564"> None of that would even exist, if it weren't for him. </seg>
<seg id="565"> Or the rock band, Tesla. </seg>
<seg id="566"> Funny. </seg>
<seg id="567"> Tesla was a true genius. </seg>
<seg id="568"> If we had paid more attention to his ideas, the world would be a much better place. We'd have free mass communication, free transportation... free energy for everyone. </seg>
<seg id="569"> That's why they discredited him in the end. For free energy. </seg>
<seg id="570"> He perceived the Earth as a conductor of acoustical resonance. </seg>
<seg id="571"> What a beautiful idea. </seg>
<seg id="572"> So, Jack, are you going to show me how the coil works? </seg>
<seg id="573"> Yeah, all right. </seg>
<seg id="574"> You'll need these. </seg>
<seg id="575"> - All right, you ready, Meg? - I'm ready. </seg>
<seg id="576"> Damn it. Something went wrong. </seg>
<seg id="577"> It was cool, though. </seg>
<seg id="578"> Yeah, but it wasn't supposed to stop. It was supposed to keep working. I don't know what happened. </seg>
<seg id="579"> I think maybe you blew a capacitor? </seg>
<seg id="580"> No, I didn't blow a capacitor, Meg. </seg>
<seg id="581"> Maybe it tripped your GFI. </seg>
<seg id="582"> Yeah, your Ground Fault Interrupter. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Yeah, I know what a GFI is. That's not what happened. </seg>
<seg id="584"> You don't have to snap at me. </seg>
<seg id="585"> I think maybe the spark gaps are too far apart on your spark coil vibrator. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Yeah, that could be it. </seg>
<seg id="587"> I guess. </seg>
<seg id="588"> Yeah, it is. That's it. </seg>
<seg id="589"> You're right about that. I didn't check that earlier. </seg>
<seg id="590"> I'm gonna go home and check it out. </seg>
<seg id="591"> - Are you going to go bowling tomorrow? - Yeah, I'll be there. </seg>
<seg id="592"> All right, I'll see you there. </seg>
<seg id="593"> Earth as a conductor of acoustical resonance. </seg>
<seg id="594"> Hello, who is this? </seg>
<seg id="595"> Laura. Hi, this is Alfred Molina for Steve Coogan. </seg>
<seg id="596"> M-O-L-I-N-A. </seg>
<seg id="597"> The actor, yes. </seg>
<seg id="598"> I was just double-checking that Steve... </seg>
<seg id="599"> He is. Great, okay. </seg>
<seg id="600"> Just in case you need it, my cell phone number... </seg>
<seg id="601"> Hello? - Hello, Alfred. - Steve, hello. </seg>
<seg id="602"> Hi. I'm so glad you could make it. Please sit down. </seg>
<seg id="603"> I was just talking to Laura, your assistant, seeing if you were on your way here. </seg>
<seg id="604"> - I'm here. - Fantastic. </seg>
<seg id="605"> I took the liberty of ordering some tea. </seg>
<seg id="606"> Shall I be mother? </seg>
<seg id="607"> That's okay, I'll be my own mother. </seg>
<seg id="608"> Some milk there for you. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Real tea. </seg>
<seg id="610"> It's hard to come by. </seg>
<seg id="611"> I have this fantasy where if I ever won a Golden Globe or an Academy Award... </seg>
<seg id="612"> I'd use the opportunity to tell the Yanks how to make a decent cup of tea. </seg>
<seg id="613"> - Here's to a good cup of tea. - Cheers. </seg>
<seg id="614"> I love your coat. </seg>
<seg id="615"> Yeah, it's Viv Westwood. </seg>
<seg id="616"> I've got a weakness for British designers. </seg>
<seg id="617"> I don't know what it is about American designers. </seg>
<seg id="618"> They're just too safe. </seg>
<seg id="619"> Aren't you going to be a little bit warm? It's about 85 outside. </seg>
<seg id="620"> No, I take it off when I go out. </seg>
<seg id="621"> It's just the air conditioning. </seg>
<seg id="622"> - So how long have you been living in LA? - We've been here about seven years. </seg>
<seg id="623"> We love it here. </seg>
<seg id="624"> I do love visiting LA. </seg>
<seg id="625"> But I always say, it's a great place to visit, it's an even nicer place to leave. </seg>
<seg id="626"> The palm trees... Palm trees annoy the fuck out of me. </seg>
<seg id="627"> It's not for everybody. I like it here. </seg>
<seg id="628"> I came out here for the work and stuff. </seg>
<seg id="629"> It's great to finally meet you. </seg>
<seg id="630"> I've got to say I'm a huge fan of your stuff... </seg>
<seg id="631"> all the stuff you've done on TV, the comedy stuff. </seg>
<seg id="632"> I've got all the tapes. I get them sent over. It's fantastic. </seg>
<seg id="633"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="634"> Likewise, I'm certainly very aware of you. </seg>
<seg id="635"> Great. </seg>
<seg id="636"> I saw that TV series you did. </seg>
<seg id="637"> Yeah, you saw that? </seg>
<seg id="638"> Yeah. Interesting. </seg>
<seg id="639"> - We got canceled. - Yeah, I heard that. </seg>
<seg id="640"> Comedy's such a difficult thing. </seg>
<seg id="641"> Your career seems to be going terribly well. You've got a lot of heat at the moment. </seg>
<seg id="642"> Is that why you're here? </seg>
<seg id="643"> The merry-go-round of meetings. It's nice. </seg>
<seg id="644"> People are finally starting to take a bit of notice, which is great. </seg>
<seg id="645"> - Are you meeting on anything interesting? - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="646"> I've got to say you were just fantastic... in 24 Hour. No, seriously, </seg>
<seg id="647"> - I mean, brilliant. Great work. - Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="648"> Really brilliant. It was... </seg>
<seg id="649"> And the reviews... </seg>
<seg id="650"> They were pretty fucking great. </seg>
<seg id="651"> I was amazed because it was... I didn't think many people would get all the cultural references. </seg>
<seg id="652"> Sort of, Manchester, early '80s, the whole music scene. </seg>
<seg id="653"> You'd be surprised. </seg>
<seg id="654"> But a lot of people didn't have any kind of reference to make to it because... </seg>
<seg id="655"> They know about the bands over here... </seg>
<seg id="656"> but the whole thing, your character, and his running the TV show... </seg>
<seg id="657"> Do you want a cigarette? </seg>
<seg id="658"> - Sorry, they're French. - No, that's okay. Thanks. </seg>
<seg id="659"> I'll save it for later. </seg>
<seg id="660"> Okay. </seg>
<seg id="661"> So, Laura said that... you were really keen to meeting. She wouldn't tell me what it was. </seg>
<seg id="662"> I didn't want to say it over the phone because it would've sounded weird. </seg>
<seg id="663"> I can imagine how she thought. This was coming out of nowhere. </seg>
<seg id="664"> I phone her up, and she doesn't know me from Adam. I said, "I must talk to Steve Coogan". </seg>
<seg id="665"> But I wanted to see you in person. </seg>
<seg id="666"> When I found out you'd be here for a few days... </seg>
<seg id="667"> I thought this was the perfect opportunity to let you know... </seg>
<seg id="668"> Anyway, I'll get right to it. I'm so excited about this. </seg>
<seg id="669"> Let me try and put it in context. I've always had a big passion for history... and people's lives... and all the little events of how you get from A to B... </seg>
<seg id="670"> and all the small details in people's lives... that are kind of really full of epic qualities. </seg>
<seg id="671"> So I've been doing all this research and... </seg>
<seg id="672"> I've come up with this. </seg>
<seg id="673"> And what state is... Is it greenlit or is it just a treatment? What stage is it? </seg>
<seg id="674"> I'm sorry. God, it's so embarrassing. </seg>
<seg id="675"> It's not some... This isn't work. It's got nothing to do with work. It's not a project. </seg>
<seg id="676"> I did some genealogical research, and I came across... What I discovered was... </seg>
<seg id="677"> - Mr. Coogan? - Yes? </seg>
<seg id="678"> - It is you, isn't it? - It is, yes. </seg>
<seg id="679"> - I'm such a huge fan. - You're not that huge. Only where it counts. </seg>
<seg id="680"> - Could I bother you for an autograph? - Absolutely. - Great. </seg>
<seg id="681"> - I've been recognized. Where do you want it? </seg>
<seg id="682"> - Paper is fine. - Spoilsport. </seg>
<seg id="683"> - No, don't do that. - Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="684"> - I probably have something in my bag. - Okay. </seg>
<seg id="685"> Just give me a second here. </seg>
<seg id="686"> Oh, gosh. - I'm so sorry. - That's all right. </seg>
<seg id="687"> - Give me one more minute. - Take your time. </seg>
<seg id="688"> - Here, please, in there. - Okay, and what's your name? Katy. </seg>
<seg id="689"> - With a "Y". - All right. </seg>
<seg id="690"> What Katy did next. </seg>
<seg id="691"> - Hello. - Alfred's an actor too. </seg>
<seg id="692"> - Here. - Thank you. Great. </seg>
<seg id="693"> - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. </seg>
<seg id="694"> - Wow. - Let's get back to this. </seg>
<seg id="695"> I don't want to take up too much of your time. I know you're busy. </seg>
<seg id="696"> As I said, I did this genealogical research... </seg>
<seg id="697"> I was just doing it for my own interest. I wasn't looking for anything specific. I just came across this. </seg>
<seg id="698"> I'll cut a long story short. Steve Coogan. </seg>
<seg id="699"> Drum roll. </seg>
<seg id="700"> The thing is, Steve... </seg>
<seg id="701"> you and I are cousins. </seg>
<seg id="702"> How do you mean? You mean artistically? </seg>
<seg id="703"> No, I mean in the normal way. We're cousins. We're related. </seg>
<seg id="704"> - It's amazing, isn't it? - Yeah. Are you sure? </seg>
<seg id="705"> The way it works out is this, look... </seg>
<seg id="706"> My great-great grandfather... is your great-great uncle. </seg>
<seg id="707"> And further back, we shared the same great-great-great grandfather. </seg>
<seg id="708"> My ancestry is Irish, but I knew there was an Italian... </seg>
<seg id="709"> That's it. The Italian connection is... the great-great-great-great grandfather, Giuseppe. </seg>
<seg id="710"> - Isn't that amazing? - Yeah, this is... </seg>
<seg id="711"> This is a lot of detail. </seg>
<seg id="712"> - It's my thing, I kind of do a little... - Amazing. </seg>
<seg id="713"> I think it's just great to be able to say that I'm related to Steve Coogan. </seg>
<seg id="714"> Likewise, I can tell people I'm related to Albert Molina. </seg>
<seg id="715"> Alfred. </seg>
<seg id="716"> It's my grandmother who's the big one on the family tree. </seg>
<seg id="717"> She'll be very thrilled. She's a huge fan of your work. She loved you in... </seg>
<seg id="718"> Boogie Nights. </seg>
<seg id="719"> Right, with the shorts and the shotgun? </seg>
<seg id="720"> Yeah, she talked about that once. </seg>
<seg id="721"> Great. I know this is coming right out of the blue, but just think of the possibilities. </seg>
<seg id="722"> It's fantastic. Let's look at the facts. </seg>
<seg id="723"> We're both actors. We're cousins, we've established that. </seg>
<seg id="724"> We could maybe work together, do a play maybe. </seg>
<seg id="725"> We could make a movie. </seg>
<seg id="726"> We could actually do a movie about this story. </seg>
<seg id="727"> About discovering this amazing thing between us, that we're cousins. </seg>
<seg id="728"> We can actually play ourselves. </seg>
<seg id="729"> We'd be in the movie. I'd be Fred Molina, you'd be Steve... We'd be cousins in the movie. </seg>
<seg id="730"> It's fantastic. It'd be great, absolutely great. </seg>
<seg id="731"> You know, or not. We could just hang out. </seg>
<seg id="732"> We should definitely go for a beer sometime. That'd be great. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Maybe go on vacation together, just the two of us... sort of get to know each other. </seg>
<seg id="734"> You're not gay are you? </seg>
<seg id="735"> No. No, I'm married. </seg>
<seg id="736"> So was James I. </seg>
<seg id="737"> Sorry. I don't know, that just popped into my head. </seg>
<seg id="738"> - Say it, get it out of the way. - I understand. </seg>
<seg id="739"> I know exactly what you're thinking. </seg>
<seg id="740"> If somebody came up to me going, I'm your cousin... </seg>
<seg id="741"> I'd think they were a nutter as well. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Take it from me, I'm not crazy. I just think this is a fantastic, extraordinary... </seg>
<seg id="743"> - Delightful thing for me. - Absolutely. </seg>
<seg id="744"> - And I just wanted you to know about it. - Ditto. </seg>
<seg id="745"> All I want, if I want anything... is for you to just acknowledge this extraordinary thing... and just love me. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Yeah, I could do that. </seg>
<seg id="747"> I have to go. </seg>
<seg id="748"> I didn't tell you. I have this meeting. - It actually moved forward. - I see. </seg>
<seg id="749"> It's at Universal. Number crunchers, financiers... </seg>
<seg id="750"> - This... - That's for you. - That's great. - It's yours. </seg>
<seg id="751"> - I'll make sure that gets filed. - Sure. </seg>
<seg id="752"> You'll be here a couple of days, right? </seg>
<seg id="753"> So maybe we could see each other before you go. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Just checking the mental diary... </seg>
<seg id="755"> This is not good, the time I'm here. </seg>
<seg id="756"> - It's just that it's packed. - I understand. No problem. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Give me your cell phone number, and I'll call you before you go. </seg>
<seg id="758"> There's a story there. </seg>
<seg id="759"> There's a tri-band system here in the States... which is different to the system in the UK... and it's a kind of... </seg>
<seg id="760"> The cell phones, they don't work here. So I'm kind of cell phone-less... - in the US. - I see. Well, give me your home number. I'll call you. </seg>
<seg id="761"> - You've got my PA's number, right? - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="762"> Great, then we're connected. </seg>
<seg id="763"> Can't you give me your number at home? </seg>
<seg id="764"> Can I say no? Because nothing, absolutely nothing personal... </seg>
<seg id="765"> It's just that I never give my number out, ever. </seg>
<seg id="766"> It's just a personal space thing. </seg>
<seg id="767"> It's just a rule and I always think, stick to the rule. </seg>
<seg id="768"> It's more of a philosophy than a rule. </seg>
<seg id="769"> I've not given my number out to many eminent people in the past. </seg>
<seg id="770"> I once didn't give my number to Sam Mendes. So you're in good company. </seg>
<seg id="771"> If it's good enough for Sam Mendes, it's good enough for me. </seg>
<seg id="772"> - I think it's me. - Right, because mine doesn't work. </seg>
<seg id="773"> I'm sorry, I got to take this. I'll get back. </seg>
<seg id="774"> Hello? </seg>
<seg id="775"> Yeah, sure. </seg>
<seg id="776"> Spike, hi. How you doing? </seg>
<seg id="777"> You got the message. </seg>
<seg id="778"> My agent just called you just to make sure we're all on the same page. </seg>
<seg id="779"> No, the producer credit is just so you and I can sort of keep tabs on everything. You know, artistic integrity, that sort of thing. </seg>
<seg id="780"> Otherwise the whole thing could just run away. </seg>
<seg id="781"> You bastard, no. </seg>
<seg id="782"> All right. </seg>
<seg id="783"> You still okay for Sunday? Good. All right. </seg>
<seg id="784"> Will I meet you there? All right. Nice and early. Okay, yeah. Lots of love. Bye, Spike. </seg>
<seg id="785"> - I'm sorry about that. - It's okay, fine. </seg>
<seg id="786"> Was that Spike Lee? </seg>
<seg id="787"> No. I don't even know Spike Lee. That was Spike Jonze. </seg>
<seg id="788"> - I love him. - Yeah, he's a good man. </seg>
<seg id="789"> We've been friends for a long time now. </seg>
<seg id="790"> We're both keen hikers. - Well, it's very boring. - No, go on. </seg>
<seg id="791"> We belong to a club, and we go hiking at weekends. </seg>
<seg id="792"> He's a very committed environmentalist. </seg>
<seg id="793"> Spike Jonze is a tree-hugger. Jesus, I never had him down as that. </seg>
<seg id="794"> I think he prefers the term "leaf people"... as do I. </seg>
<seg id="795"> Right, I mean, that's... Don't get me wrong. That's great. I love trees. </seg>
<seg id="796"> I think there should be more of them. When I use paper, I use both sides. </seg>
<seg id="797"> I would love to... You know, I'm going to tear up... that stupid rule about phone numbers. It's such shit. </seg>
<seg id="798"> Would it be shabby of me to give you my number now? </seg>
<seg id="799"> Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="800"> I've got to go. I'm so sorry. </seg>
<seg id="801"> - I'll get the check. - Good. </seg>
<seg id="802"> Fuck. </seg>
<seg id="803"> Damn RZA. Where the fuck you at? </seg>
<seg id="804"> - Yo, peace. - Bobby. </seg>
<seg id="805"> - Pardon me for being late. - Ain't nothing. - I was about to hit you on the horn. - I had a fucking emergency house call, yo. </seg>
<seg id="806"> - A house call? - Yeah, a house call. </seg>
<seg id="807"> Sophia and Sifu's children got sick with the flu and the virus. </seg>
<seg id="808"> So I went by, prescribed some herbal medicines for them. </seg>
<seg id="809"> I told them, lay off the dairy products, chill on the citric acid... and they should feel a little better. </seg>
<seg id="810"> - So you a doctor now, or something? - Yeah, I told you. </seg>
<seg id="811"> I've been studying alternative medicine for two years now, son. </seg>
<seg id="812"> I mean, ancient healing techniques, and all that. </seg>
<seg id="813"> Check this. I even know a certain surgical procedure that I can perform using a drill-gun. </seg>
<seg id="814"> Electric drill-gun. I'm dead serious. </seg>
<seg id="815"> But my hands are nice from being a DJ, you know what I mean? </seg>
<seg id="816"> To me, music and medicine, all go together. </seg>
<seg id="817"> It's like two planets revolving around the same sun. </seg>
<seg id="818"> So bong-bong. - Want some tea? - Yeah, splash me. </seg>
<seg id="819"> It's all herbals, man. No caffeine. </seg>
<seg id="820"> That's what I'm talking about. No caffeine. Caffeine is ridiculous right now, man. </seg>
<seg id="821"> Tell me about it. Caffeine leads to depression... makes you all irritable, have your heart beating fast. </seg>
<seg id="822"> Faster heart rate, you know what I mean? </seg>
<seg id="823"> And worse than anything, you drink that coffee, it gives you the shits. </seg>
<seg id="824"> You know what I mean? So I try to stay away from that. </seg>
<seg id="825"> - I'm off that shit, anyway. - Crisp and clean. No caffeine. </seg>
<seg id="826"> - To Liquid Swords, family. - No, to Bobby Digital. </seg>
<seg id="827"> - Wu-Tang forever. - Wu-Tang forever. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Anybody need more coffee? </seg>
<seg id="829"> - Kitchen's closing. - No, we don't mess with caffeine. </seg>
<seg id="830"> - You don't? - No, I don't. </seg>
<seg id="831"> Don't you know caffeine can cause serious delirium? </seg>
<seg id="832"> - Delirium? - Serious delirium. </seg>
<seg id="833"> Now you tell me. Well, that may be my problem, delirium. </seg>
<seg id="834"> Aren't you Bill Murray, man? - You're Bill Murray? - Yeah, I'm Bill Murray... but let's keep that just between us, all right? Just between us. </seg>
<seg id="835"> And you guys are related? </seg>
<seg id="836"> Yeah, we're cousins. We're family. </seg>
<seg id="837"> No, you're messing with me because you're both troublemakers. </seg>
<seg id="838"> - Troublemakers? - The Wu-Tang Clan. </seg>
<seg id="839"> Right, Wu-Tang Clan. </seg>
<seg id="840"> - You're GZA, the genius. - That's right. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - And you're RZA... - A.k.a... </seg>
<seg id="842"> - Bobby Digital. - Yeah, he knows hip-hop. </seg>
<seg id="843"> And you're Bill Murray. </seg>
<seg id="844"> Bill "Groundhog-Day-Ghostbusting-Ass" Murray. </seg>
<seg id="845"> - Who ya gonna call? - I know that. Just don't tell anybody. </seg>
<seg id="846"> What you mean, don't tell anybody, Bill Murray? </seg>
<seg id="847"> People will come here, they'll see you. You're Bill Murray. It's obvious. </seg>
<seg id="848"> Unless you're wearing a disguise or something. </seg>
<seg id="849"> I am wearing kind of a disguise. </seg>
<seg id="850"> Damn, that's harsh, money. </seg>
<seg id="851"> - You're a real caffeine junkie, aren't you? - Keep it down. Just between us. Here, cheers. </seg>
<seg id="852"> You know, before I gave that up... I used to drink it every single night... up until it was time to go to sleep. Used to make me dream faster. </seg>
<seg id="853"> You know, like when they flash those cameras on those Indy 500 cars... and they just... </seg>
<seg id="854"> That's how my dreams were. Just whizzing by. </seg>
<seg id="855"> - You're stupid, yo. - He is stupid, isn't he? Word, yo. </seg>
<seg id="856"> I know a guy who freezes coffee. Puts sticks in it, has himself a coffee Popsicle. A caf pop. </seg>
<seg id="857"> Damn. That don't sound too good, Bill Murray. </seg>
<seg id="858"> It's not the flu or anything. It's just a smoker's cough. </seg>
<seg id="859"> That's what I'm saying, nicotine interferes with your central nervous system... your respiratorial system. </seg>
<seg id="860"> In very small doses, it causes paralysis. </seg>
<seg id="861"> - Really? - Yeah, really, man. </seg>
<seg id="862"> I mean, just 50mg alone... have been proven to be fatal in a few minutes. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - How much is in one cigarette? - 3mg. </seg>
<seg id="864"> And did you know they also use nicotine for insecticide... - to kill bugs? - It's good if it kills bugs, right? </seg>
<seg id="865"> Are you a bug, Bill Murray? </seg>
<seg id="866"> - Jesus, RZA, you sound like my doctor. - He is a doctor. </seg>
<seg id="867"> Actually, he specializes in alternative medicine. </seg>
<seg id="868"> That is, alternative to this planet. </seg>
<seg id="869"> Do me a favor and don't tell anybody you saw me here, okay? </seg>
<seg id="870"> You can trust us, Bill Murray. - You hiding out or something? - Yeah, sort of, something like that. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Now I'm thinking it may be delirium. </seg>
<seg id="872"> - Serious delirium. - Serious. </seg>
<seg id="873"> If you're on the low, I got something that'll help you with your disguise. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Take this. </seg>
<seg id="875"> - Use whatever you want. - Jeez. </seg>
<seg id="876"> - Rock that, man. Stay on the low. - You didn't have to do this. This is great. </seg>
<seg id="877"> A bag of items for you, Bill. </seg>
<seg id="878"> - Thank you. - Don't worry about it. </seg>
<seg id="879"> I really appreciate this. </seg>
<seg id="880"> This is great. </seg>
<seg id="881"> Doc, what could I do for this cough? </seg>
<seg id="882"> I was just thinking about that. Check this out. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - You get some hydrogen peroxide. - We got that for cuts and stuff. </seg>
<seg id="884"> Take 50% hydrogen peroxide, 50% water. </seg>
<seg id="885"> You gargle with it. Do not swallow, you spit it out. </seg>
<seg id="886"> Don't swallow, Bill Murray. </seg>
<seg id="887"> And if that doesn't work, try oven cleaner. </seg>
<seg id="888"> I got that in the back, too. </seg>
<seg id="889"> - Thank you. - Cool. </seg>
<seg id="890"> Thank you. I'm going to try it right now. </seg>
<seg id="891"> - Word. - Word, man. </seg>
<seg id="892"> - Bill motherfucking Murray. - It's crazy, yo. </seg>
<seg id="893"> - 3:00. - What's up? </seg>
<seg id="894"> I told Ghost to be here by 3:00 a.m. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Don't hold your breath on that. You know how it is waiting on Ghost. </seg>
<seg id="896"> - We'll be here all night. - Think we can smoke a blunt up here? </seg>
<seg id="897"> - It's hot up in here with the 5-0. - But we used to always smoke weed in here. </seg>
<seg id="898"> That was until Dirt Dog done blew it up. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Told Deflon, "Never let Dirty inside this spot, man". </seg>
<seg id="900"> So what's up? What you want to do? </seg>
<seg id="901"> - Yo, let's slide to the 'udio. - Hit the 'udio, right. Play some chess? All right, then. </seg>
<seg id="902"> - Is that the bill for Murray? - He don't need no money, yo. </seg>
<seg id="903"> - Hit him, anyway. - Think I should tip him? </seg>
<seg id="904"> - You think he's using the oven cleaner? - Don't know, but let's get the fuck out. </seg>
<seg id="905"> Are you all right, Taylor? </seg>
<seg id="906"> - No, not really. - What's up? </seg>
<seg id="907"> I don't know. I feel so divorced from the world. </seg>
<seg id="908"> I've lost touch with the world. </seg>
<seg id="909"> Do you know that song by Mahler... </seg>
<seg id="910"> - I've Lost Track of the World? - No. </seg>
<seg id="911"> It's one of the most beautiful... and saddest songs ever written. </seg>
<seg id="912"> I can almost hear it now. </seg>
<seg id="913"> Can you hear it? </seg>
<seg id="914"> It's gone now. </seg>
<seg id="915"> - But did you hear it? - I think so. </seg>
<seg id="916"> It resonated right through the whole building. </seg>
<seg id="917"> - Where are we? - In the armory, Taylor. The armory, Taylor. </seg>
<seg id="918"> It sounds so heavy and ponderous. </seg>
<seg id="919"> The armory. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Nikola Tesla... </seg>
<seg id="921"> perceived the Earth as a conductor... of acoustical resonance. </seg>
<seg id="922"> I have no idea what you're talking about. </seg>
<seg id="923"> Can you explain it to me? </seg>
<seg id="924"> - No, not really. - I know. Let's pretend this coffee is champagne. </seg>
<seg id="925"> Why would we do that? </seg>
<seg id="926"> Well, to celebrate life. </seg>
<seg id="927"> You know, like the rich, elegant people do. </seg>
<seg id="928"> The classy people. </seg>
<seg id="929"> I prefer coffee. Simple, working man's coffee. </seg>
<seg id="930"> You're so provincial, Bill. Do you know what your problem is? </seg>
<seg id="931"> What? </seg>
<seg id="932"> You have no joie de vivre. </seg>
<seg id="933"> I don't? </seg>
<seg id="934"> No, besides, this coffee is awful. </seg>
<seg id="935"> - You're right. It really is bad, isn't it? - Dreadful. </seg>
<seg id="936"> I propose a toast. </seg>
<seg id="937"> So what should we toast? </seg>
<seg id="938"> Paris in the 1920s. </seg>
<seg id="939"> Josephine Baker, the Moulin Rouge. </seg>
<seg id="940"> What is it? Okay? And also... </seg>
<seg id="941"> New York in the '70s. In the late '70s. </seg>
<seg id="942"> Really? All right. </seg>
<seg id="943"> Cheers. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Delicious, isn't it? </seg>
<seg id="945"> Champagne, nectar of the gods. </seg>
<seg id="946"> Is that all you're having for lunch, coffee and a cigarette? </seg>
<seg id="947"> It's not very healthy. </seg>
<seg id="948"> We had lunch earlier. We did? </seg>
<seg id="949"> We're on a break here, a coffee break. </seg>
<seg id="950"> How depressing. </seg>
<seg id="951"> How long is our break, anyway? </seg>
<seg id="952"> About 10 minutes, and it's nearly over now. </seg>
<seg id="953"> Say it isn't true. </seg>
<seg id="954"> - Well? - What? </seg>
<seg id="955"> I asked you to say it isn't true. </seg>
<seg id="956"> Say what isn't true? </seg>
<seg id="957"> Never mind. </seg>
<seg id="958"> Anyway, I have to have a nap. </seg>
<seg id="959"> So call me when the break is over. </seg>
<seg id="960"> Well, you have two minutes or less for your nap. </seg>

<doc docid="deathproof" genre="subtitles" origlang="en" sysid="sys">
<seg id="1"> Hold on. I gotta come up. </seg>
<seg id="2"> I gotta take the world's biggest fucking piss. </seg>
<seg id="3"> We can't be late. We won't! </seg>
<seg id="4"> - Who's holding? - lf you're not then nobody. </seg>
<seg id="5"> We were kind of hoping you were. - Yeah. How are you not holding? - Jesus Christ Shanna. It is not my fucking job to supply y'all with weed when we go out. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Whoa whoa whoa whoa little lady. </seg>
<seg id="7"> You're getting angry kind of quick don't you think? </seg>
<seg id="8"> - l was just teasing you. - l'm not angry. It just would be nice if y'all didn't just count on me all the fucking time and surprise me every once in a while with pot. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Okay mean girl in a high school movie. Are you through having a tantrum? - l'm not having a tantrum. - Yes you are. </seg>
<seg id="10"> You've been in the car all of two seconds and you're already cursing at me. </seg>
<seg id="11"> - l am not cursing at you. - You said "Jesus Christ Shanna." </seg>
<seg id="12"> And then before the sentence was over you threw a "fucking" in there to emphasize your "irritatance." All right. Come on guys. Don't fight. I'll pay for it when we get some. </seg>
<seg id="13"> One: It is not about the money. It is about the pain in the ass of scoring. And two: We're not really fighting. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Arlene have you forgotten what hanging out with Jungle Julia's like? </seg>
<seg id="15"> That wasn't a fight. </seg>
<seg id="16"> That was Julia acting like a grumpy bitch and me calling her on it and indulging her at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="17"> That's how we tolerate each other after all these years. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Oh billboard. </seg>
<seg id="19"> So what's the plan man? Margaritas and Mexican food at Guero's. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Did you call Rafael and tell him we're coming? - Of course. </seg>
<seg id="21"> - You're so good. I know. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Okay is Christian Simonson gonna be there? </seg>
<seg id="23"> You bet your ass he is. He's gonna be there with Jesse Letterman. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Christian Simonson the filmmaker is in town. </seg>
<seg id="25"> He's got a big thing for Julia. If he had a big thing for me he'd fucking call me as opposed to disappearing for six months and he'd get his ass down here more often than he does and on my birthday give me a fucking phone call. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Oh billboard. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Yeah but you get those legs of yours around him and it's all over. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Yeah well when l'm redecorating his house in the hills that l am also living in I'll let you know it worked. </seg>
<seg id="29"> So margaritas and Mexican food at Guero's touch base with Chris and Jesse tell them about later and make damn sure they come. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Those other guys will be waiting for us to join them at the Texas Chili Parlor. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Oh shit. Speaking of which what happened with you and Nate last night? </seg>
<seg id="32"> Well you know not mu-- We just fucking met each other. </seg>
<seg id="33"> I mean if you don't bust their balls a little bit they're never gonna respect you. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Okay we're pretty clear on what it is you didn't do. </seg>
<seg id="35"> How about enlightening us on what it is you did do? </seg>
<seg id="36"> Nothing to write home about. </seg>
<seg id="37"> We just made out on the couch for about 20 minutes. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Dressed half-dressed or naked? </seg>
<seg id="39"> Dressed. I said we made out. We didn't do the thing. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Excuse me for living but what is "the thing"? </seg>
<seg id="41"> You know it's everything but. They call it "the thing"? </seg>
<seg id="42"> I call it "the thing." Do guys like the thing? </seg>
<seg id="43"> They like it better than no thing. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Okay l wanna get back to what it is you did do. </seg>
<seg id="45"> So you're making out on the couch with Nate right? - Correct. - Whose couch? - His or the one in your hotel room? - What am I stupid over here? Mine. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Were you making out sitting up or lying down? </seg>
<seg id="47"> We started sitting up. We worked our way to lying down. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Mmm the plot thickens. Who was on top? I was straddling him. </seg>
<seg id="49"> - What else? - That was it. So we made out for a little while on the couch and I said "Okay l'm gonna go to bed now so it's time for you to leave." </seg>
<seg id="50"> And then he starts to whine "Oh right now?" </seg>
<seg id="51"> And l said "Yep right now. Let's go." And he says "Well wait. What about this?" </seg>
<seg id="52"> And I said "No." He said "What do you mean no? You don't even know what l'm gonna say." </seg>
<seg id="53"> I said "l already know what you're gonna say and the answer's no." </seg>
<seg id="54"> He said "How can you say you know what I'm gonna say?" </seg>
<seg id="55"> I said "Because you're gonna say 'let's just go to sleep together. "'We don't gotta do nothing. "'Just cuddle sleep next to each other wake up in the morning together.' No you're gonna leave but I'll see you tomorrow." </seg>
<seg id="56"> Yeah fuck Nate. I mean he's cute and all </seg>
<seg id="57"> but Jesse Letterman's gonna be all over her. </seg>
<seg id="58"> - Jesse Letterman-- - Remember no hooking up tonight. </seg>
<seg id="59"> You can hang out with him you can make out with him but no hooking up with him because we are driving to Lake LBJ tonight and my daddy's pretty clear about one thing. </seg>
<seg id="60"> He said "l am letting you and your girlfriends stay at my lake house not you and a bunch of horny boys trying to get their fuck on with my daughter." </seg>
<seg id="61"> - Your dad talks like that? - Hell yeah! </seg>
<seg id="62"> It's not like he ain't gonna know either because when I'm staying at the lake house with my girlfriends in our bikinis Daddy just has a tendency to pop up and make sure we don't need anything. </seg>
<seg id="63"> Look he's totally harmless and cute as a bug's ear. </seg>
<seg id="64"> But you know when he's got a bunch of half-naked poontang walking the floor of his lake house he just likes to pay us a visit and make sure we got everything we need. </seg>
<seg id="65"> And if you flirt shamelessly with him like the six-foot baby giraffe in the backseat you got a puppy dog for life. </seg>
<seg id="66"> I have my own relationship with Ben and you're just jealous 'cause it don't include you. </seg>
<seg id="67"> - You call her dad Ben? - l'm not a child. That's his name. </seg>
<seg id="68"> So when are the boys showing up? They're gonna meet us at the Chili Parlor. </seg>
<seg id="69"> Maybe they can bring some pot. Fuck that. No. </seg>
<seg id="70"> I don't wanna be either A depending on their fucking ass or B depending on their ass. Uh-uh. We don't score ourselves we're gonna be stuck with them all fucking night. </seg>
<seg id="71"> Ooh try Lanna Frank. Best idea you had all day. </seg>
<seg id="72"> Oh hey that's your last billboard before Guero's. </seg>
<seg id="73"> Oh come on. Give me a break. </seg>
<seg id="74"> "Oh come on" my ass! We said every time. Okay. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Jules let me get a drag? Thanks. </seg>
<seg id="76"> - Hey. - Hey. </seg>
<seg id="77"> - You wanna join us? - For a second but l'm with some friends. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Oh. So you must be-- must be-- So you must be the infamous Butterfly. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Shh! She don't know nothing about it. </seg>
<seg id="80"> - Know about what? - When were y'all gonna tell her? </seg>
<seg id="81"> - Soon. - Tell me what? Yeah now thanks to you we gotta tell her sooner than later. </seg>
<seg id="82"> All right cut the shit. What the fuck is going on? </seg>
<seg id="83"> I said a little somethin'-somethin' about you on the air today. </seg>
<seg id="84"> Julia what the fuck did you say about me on the radio? </seg>
<seg id="85"> All I said was I had a sexy friend named Butterfly who was in from out of town for the weekend and we would be going out somewhere in Austin tonight and if they were out on the town maybe they'd see us. And l described you and I said that if they spotted you while we were out if they'd do something you'd do something. </seg>
<seg id="86"> Okay now Julia I'm serious. What did you say and what did you say l'd do? </seg>
<seg id="87"> Anyhoo l could explain what l said which would be boring or Marcy over here who is an incredible actress could act it out for you which I think will give you a better idea of what you have in store for you tonight. </seg>
<seg id="88"> Okay so just tell me your way. - So we'll act it out with Marcy? - Sure. </seg>
<seg id="89"> Okay give Marcy your drink. Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Okay so you're in a club or a bar and Marcy's a kind of cute or kind of hot or kind of sexy or better be fucking hysterically funny but not funny-looking guy who you could fuck. </seg>
<seg id="91"> - Got it. - Okay Marcy take it. </seg>
<seg id="92"> Howdy. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Hi there. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Excuse me but your name wouldn't be Butterfly would it? </seg>
<seg id="95"> Yes it is. lt seems you have me at a disadvantage. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Barry. Pleased to meet you Barry. - Y'all are getting me hot. - Shh! </seg>
<seg id="97"> So is uh Butterfly your real name? </seg>
<seg id="98"> Yes it is. And how'd you know my name Barry? </seg>
<seg id="99"> I listened to Jungle Julia's show this morning. </seg>
<seg id="100"> Oh you did did you? Oh yeah. l listen to her show every morning. </seg>
<seg id="101"> Oh you do do you? Yeah. She's like the coolest lady in town. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Don't you think she's got a big ass? Nah man. </seg>
<seg id="103"> I like her ass that way. </seg>
<seg id="104"> She got a black girl's ass. </seg>
<seg id="105"> Well that's what she always says but natural fact she doesn't really have a black girl's ass. - She's got a big ass. - Okay what the fuck are you doing? </seg>
<seg id="106"> Oh look who wants to get to the point all of a sudden. Okay we'll get to the point. </seg>
<seg id="107"> But for your information skinny bitch black men and a whole lot of motherfucking white men have had plenty fun adoring my ass. </seg>
<seg id="108"> I don't wear their teeth marks on my butt for nothing. </seg>
<seg id="109"> All right if you're not gonna buy me a drink can I have mine back? No. Okay okay okay okay. </seg>
<seg id="110"> So Butterfly can I buy you a drink? - l'd love one. - What can l get you? I'll take a margarita. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Here you go. </seg>
<seg id="112"> So after they buy you a drink when they raise their glass to toast they look you dead in the eye and repeat this poem: "The woods are lovely dark and deep "and l have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep. </seg>
<seg id="113"> "Did you hear me Butterfly? </seg>
<seg id="114"> Miles to go before you sleep." </seg>
<seg id="115"> And then if they say that... you gotta give them a lap dance. What? </seg>
<seg id="116"> If they call you Butterfly buy you a drink repeat that poem you gotta give them a lap dance. That's bullshit. I ain't giving them nothing. Well you can do it or not but if you don't everybody in Austin's gonna think you're a chickenshit. And l don't think you want everybody in Austin thinking you're a chickenshit. </seg>
<seg id="117"> I ain't giving nobody no lap dance 'cause of what you said. </seg>
<seg id="118"> Oh come on. It's gonna be funny. Yeah everything's funny to you two when it's happening to me. </seg>
<seg id="119"> Look you don't have to do it for anybody you don't want. </seg>
<seg id="120"> l said you'd do it for the first guy who says it. So some geek comes over trying to be cool just tell him you already did it at another place earlier. </seg>
<seg id="121"> No harm no foul but you get a free drink out of it. But maybe a little later in the evening you've had a few drinks you're kind of loosey-goosey you're safe with your girls then some kind of cute kind of hot kind of sexy hysterically funny but not funny-looking guy comes up and says it then maybe you did it earlier maybe you didn't. </seg>
<seg id="122"> Where the hell is Lanna Frank? That's a good fucking question. </seg>
<seg id="123"> Lanna Frank! Where are you? </seg>
<seg id="124"> Well come over already. We're waiting for you. </seg>
<seg id="125"> Shit! Hold on! </seg>
<seg id="126"> So where are you? </seg>
<seg id="127"> Come over already. We're waiting for you. </seg>
<seg id="128"> No we're not coming over there. You come over here like you said you would. </seg>
<seg id="129"> So is it "Shawna" and the girls at the lake house this weekend? </seg>
<seg id="130"> - "Shawna"? - Oh fuck! I-- </seg>
<seg id="131"> No. Now there is one thing that every girl in the whole world whose name is Shanna has in common with each other we all hate the name Shawna and we really hate it when people call us Shawna. </seg>
<seg id="132"> Just remember it's Shanna Banana not Shawna Banawna. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Okay but at some point in the evening l had fuckability stock. </seg>
<seg id="134"> Yeah. l mean... it wasn't bullish but... </seg>
<seg id="135"> Okay Warren's sending over shots. And you know the house rule: </seg>
<seg id="136"> If he sends over shots you've gotta do them. - What? - Hey them's the rules baby. Warren says it we do it! </seg>
<seg id="137"> l love that philosophy: "Warren says it we do it." </seg>
<seg id="138"> - So let's do it! - What is it? </seg>
<seg id="139"> Hey shot first questions later. Here we go! Post time! </seg>
<seg id="140"> Mmm! </seg>
<seg id="141"> Whoo-hoo! </seg>
<seg id="142"> Now is that a tasty beverage or is that a tasty beverage? </seg>
<seg id="143"> What the fuck is it? </seg>
<seg id="144"> Chartreuse the only liquor so good they named a color after it. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Who's down for dos Chartreuse? </seg>
<seg id="146"> Not me. - l'm going out for a smoke. </seg>
<seg id="147"> But careful where you keep that hot flame all right? </seg>
<seg id="148"> Drinks. What can I get you? Shanna Banana? </seg>
<seg id="149"> Another big-ass Long Island iced tea. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Bombay Sapphire and tonic no ice. Good boy. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Oh hey Punky uh one of the lights is off in the parking lot. Flip it. </seg>
<seg id="152"> - Oh Jesus Christ! - Whoa! </seg>
<seg id="153"> You scared the fuck out of me you shitty asshole! </seg>
<seg id="154"> l swear Arlene I was not trying to scare you. </seg>
<seg id="155"> I just got lucky. Oh hardy-fucking-har. Go inside. - Wait a minute. - Why? - l was thinking we could make out. - What on a porch? Not even in the bar but in front of the entrance? </seg>
<seg id="156"> - Forget it. - No in my car. </seg>
<seg id="157"> What out there? It's wet as fucking 'Nam out there. Not in my car it's not. </seg>
<seg id="158"> Look you won't get wet. I promise you. </seg>
<seg id="159"> You know most guys wouldn't brag about that. </seg>
<seg id="160"> Ha-ha-ha. You know what l mean. </seg>
<seg id="161"> Look l know you guys are going to Lake LBJ and we can't come. I wanna make out! Okay just stop with the whining. lt's not attractive. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Okay but I don't want it super-fucking obvious </seg>
<seg id="163"> to everybody in the bar l've been gone so we'll go in your car we'll make out for six minutes and that's it. </seg>
<seg id="164"> - Deal? - Great. </seg>
<seg id="165"> No no no. Deal or no deal? If you're gonna whine when l pull the plug in six minutes we can just walk back inside the fucking bar right now. </seg>
<seg id="166"> - Deal. No whining. - And no begging. And no begging. When you say done it's done. </seg>
<seg id="167"> I'm gonna remember you said that. Okay let's go. </seg>
<seg id="168"> Oh you got two jobs: kiss good and make sure my hair don't get wet. </seg>
<seg id="169"> Now look you can't look like you're trying to get her out of here before Christian Simonson shows up </seg>
<seg id="170"> but you've got to get her out of here before Christian Simonson shows up. </seg>
<seg id="171"> But what's the point? They're going to Shanna's daddy's house at Lake LBJ and it's no guys-- absolutely no guys. </seg>
<seg id="172"> Okay so after we bring the girls drinks in fairly rapid order but not obvious we order two more rounds of shots. You think they're gonna fall for that? </seg>
<seg id="173"> We'll be very convincing. Now it's time to turn up the volume. No more fucking around. We go to Jäger shots. </seg>
<seg id="174"> Man they're not gonna drink Jäger shots. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Dude as long as a guy's buying the booze a fucking bitch'll drink anything. </seg>
<seg id="176"> Come on dude we can at least get one shot of Jäger down these fucking bitches' throats. </seg>
<seg id="177"> After that we'll see if they got another Jäger shot in them. </seg>
<seg id="178"> You never know. That could be the shot that puts them past the point of "fuck it." </seg>
<seg id="179"> Then all of a sudden "no guys at the lake house" turns into "a couple of guys at the lake house." My point exactly. </seg>
<seg id="180"> l know l can at least get Shanna "Suck My" Banana to do a fucking Buttery Nipple shot. </seg>
<seg id="181"> What's Julia's sweet shot? - Key lime pie. - Oh come on. Even fucking Leroy Brown'd do one more for dessert. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Dude check it out. I wonder if B.J. brought the Bear with him. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Jesus! </seg>
<seg id="184"> Dude fucking cut himself falling out of his time machine. </seg>
<seg id="185"> Could l get a chicken suit for Stroker Ace please? </seg>
<seg id="186"> And where did you two disappear to? I had to get something out of the car and Nate was gentlemanly enough to escort me with his umbrella. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Ah good for you Nate. You see that pretty girl sitting by herself at the bar? </seg>
<seg id="188"> Who the dirty hippie? Meow. She's not a hippie. </seg>
<seg id="189"> She might as well be a hippie. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Thank you Timmy boy. Well do you know what just happened to her? </seg>
<seg id="191"> No. But I know she's a skinny fake-blonde bitch. </seg>
<seg id="192"> Oh l'm sorry. You were telling a story. What about her? </seg>
<seg id="193"> Hey Warren is there anybody in this place you could vouch for to give me a ride home? </seg>
<seg id="194"> Fair lady your chariot awaits. You've been eavesdropping? </seg>
<seg id="195"> Oh eavesdropping and can't help but hear. I think I belong in the latter category. </seg>
<seg id="196"> So uh Icy Hot are you offering me a ride home? </seg>
<seg id="197"> l'm offering you a lift if when l'm ready to leave you are too. </seg>
<seg id="198"> And when are you thinking about leaving? </seg>
<seg id="199"> Truthfully I'm not thinking about it. But when l do you will be the first to know. </seg>
<seg id="200"> Will you be able to uh drive later? </seg>
<seg id="201"> I know looks can be deceiving but I'm a teetotaler. </seg>
<seg id="202"> I've been drinking club soda and lime all night and now l'm building up to my big drink. </seg>
<seg id="203"> Which is what? Virgin piña colada. </seg>
<seg id="204"> Okay. Why would someone who doesn't drink spend hours at a bar drinking water? </seg>
<seg id="205"> A bar offers all kind of things other than alcohol. </seg>
<seg id="206"> Mmm. Really? Like what? </seg>
<seg id="207"> Women nacho grande platters the fellowship of some fascinating individuals like Warren here. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Alcohol is just a lubricant for all the individual encounters that a barroom offers. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Ooh. Is that cowboy wisdom? I'm not a cowboy Pam. </seg>
<seg id="210"> I'm a stuntman. But that's a very easy mistake to make. </seg>
<seg id="211"> How do you know my name? </seg>
<seg id="212"> When you were talking with Warren couldn't help but overhear. </seg>
<seg id="213"> Fair enough. So what's your name Icy? </seg>
<seg id="214"> Stuntman Mike. Stuntman Mike's your name? </seg>
<seg id="215"> You ask anybody. </seg>
<seg id="216"> Hey Warren who is this guy? Stuntman Mike. </seg>
<seg id="217"> - And who the hell is Stuntman Mike? - He's a stuntman. </seg>
<seg id="218"> You know Pam I think it's time for my big drink. </seg>
<seg id="219"> Well Stuntman Mike since I have a tab here can l buy you that virgin piña colada? </seg>
<seg id="220"> Thank you Pam. That would be lovely. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Warren a uh virgin piña colada for my stuntman friend </seg>
<seg id="222"> and I'll have another Cadillac Cabo Wabo margarita. </seg>
<seg id="223"> Cabo Wabo virgin. </seg>
<seg id="224"> That table. Seems to keep um getting your attention. Is that the girl from the billboard outside? - Yep. - She sure is a striking-looking woman. </seg>
<seg id="225"> It's got gin tequila-- </seg>
<seg id="226"> - Look at that hair. - Lots of leave-in conditioner. </seg>
<seg id="227"> - ls that jealousy l detect? - Hardly. </seg>
<seg id="228"> But if you wanna get with uh Jungle Julia there's a real easy way to do that. - Really? - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="229"> - What would that be? - Get famous. </seg>
<seg id="230"> You won't have to find her. She'll find you. </seg>
<seg id="231"> And you don't even wanna know what she did for that billboard. </seg>
<seg id="232"> Enjoy it cocksucker. You've earned it. </seg>
<seg id="233"> What did she ever do to you? </seg>
<seg id="234"> We went to school together from kindergarten through high school. </seg>
<seg id="235"> That's what she did to me. </seg>
<seg id="236"> She was her height right now at 12. She was a monster. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Half the guys she still fucks from the old class she used to beat up and terrorize in the fifth grade. </seg>
<seg id="238"> l see. And she used to beat you up and take your chocolate milk huh? </seg>
<seg id="239"> That pituitary case? Might've kicked my ass a couple of times. </seg>
<seg id="240"> Sorry. l'm built like a girl not a black man. But I'd die before I ever gave Julia Lucai my chocolate milk. </seg>
<seg id="241"> Hey are you famous or something? </seg>
<seg id="242"> Or something. No no no. Really. </seg>
<seg id="243"> Hey what do you do? Really? </seg>
<seg id="244"> What I do is work my ass off to get my own record label off the ground. </seg>
<seg id="245"> But why that girl wanted a picture of me is because l'm a local deejay. </seg>
<seg id="246"> Wait a minute. </seg>
<seg id="247"> You got a billboard by Big Kahuna Burger don't you? Yeah. I got one there too Zatoichi. Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="248"> Jungle Julia Lucai. Stuntman Mike McKay. </seg>
<seg id="249"> Well good to meet you Stuntman Mike. </seg>
<seg id="250"> Now my friends and I are gonna continue to get our weed on. </seg>
<seg id="251"> - Would you care for some? - Thank you Julia. But just the same no thanks. </seg>
<seg id="252"> - Suit yourself. - But you know-- </seg>
<seg id="253"> Aw shit. Oh God. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Sorry. lt's nothing. </seg>
<seg id="255"> What the fuck was that? </seg>
<seg id="256"> Actually l do want you to have a shot. </seg>
<seg id="257"> You got some voucher here. </seg>
<seg id="258"> I asked him what movies you worked on. No fucking clue. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Well technically l really don't know if he's ever done anything for sure. </seg>
<seg id="260"> I mean he shows me an episode of High Chaparall a guy falls off a horse he says it's him. </seg>
<seg id="261"> You know the show The Virginian? </seg>
<seg id="262"> Yeah well there was another actor on that show-- Gary Clarke-- and I looked like him a bit. </seg>
<seg id="263"> Obviously before I cut myself shaving. </seg>
<seg id="264"> Oh I like it. </seg>
<seg id="265"> Well damn if you ain't so sweet you make sugar taste just like salt. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Anyway I did a lot of Virginians doubling Gary Clarke. </seg>
<seg id="267"> And uh then that show turned into The Men of Shiloh they brought on Lee Majors and l doubled him. </seg>
<seg id="268"> From that point on I specialized mostly in car stunts. </seg>
<seg id="269"> Yeah I did damn near the whole third season of Vegas. </seg>
<seg id="270"> I was Robert Urich's driving double. </seg>
<seg id="271"> And then Bob did another show-- Gavilan and he brought me with him on that till... </seg>
<seg id="272"> And after that... </seg>
<seg id="273"> Do you know any of these shows or people I'm talking about? </seg>
<seg id="274"> Sorry. - No. - No. </seg>
<seg id="275"> So how exactly does one become a stuntman Stuntman Mike? </seg>
<seg id="276"> Well in Hollywood anybody fool enough to throw himself down a flight of stairs can usually find somebody to pay him for it. </seg>
<seg id="277"> But really l got into the business the way most people get in the stunt business. - How's that? - My brother got me in it. - Well who's your brother? - Stuntman Bob. </seg>
<seg id="278"> - I'm ready to blaze. - Finally. Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="279"> - You need to catch up with us. - Now the party can start. </seg>
<seg id="280"> Yep. Anyhoo l'm sorry. Will you forgive me? </seg>
<seg id="281"> But you have to be real nice to me for the whole rest of the time l'm here. </seg>
<seg id="282"> - Promise. You ready to go to the lake? - Mm-hmm. </seg>
<seg id="283"> How about your little friend? You wanna bring him? I thought no boys. If you really want him to come Shanna won't mind. </seg>
<seg id="284"> So how about it? Boys or just us girls? Us girls. Good idea. </seg>
<seg id="285"> Ladies. </seg>
<seg id="286"> Thanks. Cheers Butterfly. </seg>
<seg id="287"> "The woods are lovely dark and deep "and I have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep. </seg>
<seg id="288"> "Did you hear me Butterfly? </seg>
<seg id="289"> Miles to go before you sleep." </seg>
<seg id="290"> Sorry Stuntman Burt-- Mike. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Mike. She already broke off that dance. Is that true? </seg>
<seg id="292"> Did l miss my chance? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Do I frighten you? </seg>
<seg id="294"> Is it my scar? </seg>
<seg id="295"> It's your car. Ah. Yeah I know. </seg>
<seg id="296"> Sorry. It's my mom's car. </seg>
<seg id="297"> Have you been following us? No. But that's what I love about Austin. It's just so damn small. </seg>
<seg id="298"> - You've seen this guy before? - l saw him outside of Guero's. </seg>
<seg id="299"> And l saw you outside Guero's too. </seg>
<seg id="300"> You saw my car l saw your legs. </seg>
<seg id="301"> Now look I ain't stalking y'all but I didn't say I wasn't a wolf. </seg>
<seg id="302"> So you really weren't following us? I'm not following you Butterfly. </seg>
<seg id="303"> I just got lucky. </seg>
<seg id="304"> So how about that lap dance? </seg>
<seg id="305"> Sorry. lt was a one-time-only offer and she did it earlier this evening at Anton's. </seg>
<seg id="306"> - No she didn't. - How do you know? </seg>
<seg id="307"> I'm good that way. And you look a little touchéd. </seg>
<seg id="308"> - What's "touchéd"? - Wounded slightly. </seg>
<seg id="309"> Why should I be wounded? Because you expected guys to be pestering you all night but from your look I can tell nobody pestered you at all. That kind of hurt your feelings a little bit didn't it? There are few things as fetching as a bruised ego on a beautiful angel. </seg>
<seg id="310"> So... how about that lap dance? </seg>
<seg id="311"> I think I'm gonna have to give you a rain check. </seg>
<seg id="312"> Well since you'll be leaving in the next couple of days that rain check will be worthless. </seg>
<seg id="313"> But that's okay. </seg>
<seg id="314"> I understand if I make you uncomfortable. </seg>
<seg id="315"> You're still a nice girl and I still like you. </seg>
<seg id="316"> But I must warn you of something. </seg>
<seg id="317"> You know how people say... </seg>
<seg id="318"> "You're okay in my book" or "ln my book that's no good"? </seg>
<seg id="319"> Well l actually have a book. And everybody I ever meet goes in this book. </seg>
<seg id="320"> And now l've met you and you're going in the book. </seg>
<seg id="321"> Except l'm afraid I must file you... under "chickenshit." </seg>
<seg id="322"> And what if l did it? </seg>
<seg id="323"> Well I definitely couldn't file you under "chickenshit" then now could I? </seg>
<seg id="324"> What's your name again? Stuntman Mike. </seg>
<seg id="325"> Well Stuntman Mike l'm Butterfly. My friend Jungle Julia over here says that jukebox inside is pretty impressive. </seg>
<seg id="326"> - Yeah it is. - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="327"> Why don't you go get ready for your lap dance? </seg>
<seg id="328"> What about "kind of cute kind of hot kind of sexy hysterically funny but not funny-looking guy who you could fuck" did you not understand? </seg>
<seg id="329"> I think you got Mike laid tonight. </seg>
<seg id="330"> - He's old enough to be my dad-- - I can still hear you. </seg>
<seg id="331"> - Bye. - Bye-bye. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Wow that's fucking scary. Yeah well I wanted it to be impressive. </seg>
<seg id="333"> Scary tends to impress. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Is it safe? Oh it's better than safe. It's death proof. </seg>
<seg id="335"> How do you make a car death proof? Well that's what stuntmen do. You've seen a movie where a car gets into some smash-up there ain't no way in hell anybody's walking away from? </seg>
<seg id="336"> Yeah. Well how do you think they accomplish that? </seg>
<seg id="337"> CGI? </seg>
<seg id="338"> Well unfortunately Pam nowadays more often than not you're right. </seg>
<seg id="339"> But back in the all-or-nothing days the Vanishing Point days the Dirty Mary Crazy Larry days the White Line Fever days-- real cars smashing into real cars with real dumb people driving them. </seg>
<seg id="340"> So you give the stunt team the car you want to smash up take her and reinforce that fucker everywhere and voilà you got yourself a death-proof automobile. </seg>
<seg id="341"> That makes sense. I just didn't know you could make a car death proof. </seg>
<seg id="342"> Hell I can drive this baby into a brick wall doing 125 miles an hour just for the experience. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Why is your passenger seat in a box? Well this is a movie car. </seg>
<seg id="344"> Sometimes when you're shooting a crash director wants to put a camera in the car. You know shoot the crash from the inside. </seg>
<seg id="345"> That's where you put the camera. They call it a crash box. Here. </seg>
<seg id="346"> There you go. </seg>
<seg id="347"> You know when you asked to drive me home you didn't mention your car didn't have a passenger seat. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Yeah well actually I didn't ask to drive you home. You asked me for a ride and l said yes. But look at the bright side Pam. I won't be getting fresh putting my hand on your knee. That is the bright side. </seg>
<seg id="349"> I thought so. </seg>
<seg id="350"> Well Pam which way you going? - Left or right? - Right. Ah that's too bad. Why? </seg>
<seg id="351"> Well because there was a 50-50 shot on whether you'd be going left or right. </seg>
<seg id="352"> You see we're both going left. You could've just as easily been going left too and if that was the case it would've been a while before you started getting scared. </seg>
<seg id="353"> But since you're going the other way I'm afraid... you're gonna have to start getting scared...immediately. </seg>
<seg id="354"> What the fuck? </seg>
<seg id="355"> Cocksucking motherfucker! Just fucking let me out of here! </seg>
<seg id="356"> I'll fucking rip your fucking-- Stop the fucking car! </seg>
<seg id="357"> Okay here's the thing. I get it. </seg>
<seg id="358"> I-- l know it's a joke and it's super-funny. </seg>
<seg id="359"> Um but if you just stop right now you know and-- and-- and let me out I'll never tell anybody because l know it's a joke. </seg>
<seg id="360"> I know all about jokes. I promise everything will be fine. </seg>
<seg id="361"> Just-- Just-- Just let me out please and-- and-- Hey Pam </seg>
<seg id="362"> remember when I said this car was death proof? </seg>
<seg id="363"> Well that wasn't a lie. </seg>
<seg id="364"> This car is 100% death proof. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Only to get the benefit of it honey you really need to be sitting in my seat. </seg>
<seg id="366"> Now I gotta catch me my other girlfriends. </seg>
<seg id="367"> No no no no.lt's Dave Dee Dozy Beaky Mitch and Tich. </seg>
<seg id="368"> So you got it? Thanks honey. You're gonna play it next song right? </seg>
<seg id="369"> Good boy. </seg>
<seg id="370"> Growl. </seg>
<seg id="371"> Bye-bye. </seg>
<seg id="372"> Who do you wanna hear? Dave Dee Dozy Beaky Mitch and Tich. </seg>
<seg id="373"> Who? Dave Dee Dozy Beaky Mitch and Tich. </seg>
<seg id="374"> Who the fuck are they? For your information Pete Townshend at one point almost quit The Who and if he had he would've ended up in this group thus making it Dave Dee Dozy Beaky Mitch Tich and Pete. And if you ask me he should have. That's my boy! I wanna hear this part of the song louder! </seg>
<seg id="375"> Do you remember anything? </seg>
<seg id="376"> Uh l don't remember. </seg>
<seg id="377"> Dr. Block. </seg>
<seg id="378"> Well what's the patient's prognosis Dr. Block? </seg>
<seg id="379"> I don't really see it's any of your business. Come on now sis. You just tell us. </seg>
<seg id="380"> How bad is he? </seg>
<seg id="381"> He got banged up real good. Busted nose broken collarbone smashed up his left index finger. Is that it? </seg>
<seg id="382"> He was real lucky. </seg>
<seg id="383"> That'll be all? Why that's more than enough and I wanna thank you Dr. Block. </seg>
<seg id="384"> Son of a bitch! </seg>
<seg id="385"> So Pop what do you think? Well son number one what I think is so goddamn ghoulish I hesitate to speak it out loud. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Well give it a shot. Well what we have here is a case of vehicular homicide. </seg>
<seg id="387"> That old boy in there murdered them pretty little gals. </seg>
<seg id="388"> I mean he used a car and not a hatchet but they dead just the same. </seg>
<seg id="389"> Well what are you gonna do? Not a goddamn thing. </seg>
<seg id="390"> The DA says ain't no crime here. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Every one of them gals was swimming in alcohol and floating on weed. And old Hooper in there came out clean as a whistle. </seg>
<seg id="392"> Now you actually think that he premeditatedly murdered them gals? </seg>
<seg id="393"> Well I can't prove it but since thinking don't cost nothing I can think it and I do. </seg>
<seg id="394"> Yeah but Pop he got pretty banged up hisself. </seg>
<seg id="395"> Well hell yeah he got banged up but God damn! Them pretty little gals look like a goddamn giant chewed 'em up and spit 'em out. </seg>
<seg id="396"> Any of 'em survive? Shit. </seg>
<seg id="397"> Two tons of metal flesh and bone and plain old Newton... They all princess died. </seg>
<seg id="398"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="399"> Well l'd guestimate it's a sex thing. </seg>
<seg id="400"> The only way l can figure it. </seg>
<seg id="401"> High-velocity impact twisted metal busted glass all four souls taken exactly at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="402"> Probably the only way that diabolical degenerate can shoot his goo. </seg>
<seg id="403"> Yeah l think the only thing we can dream of getting that bastard on is vehicular manslaughter for the hitchhiker in the death box. That was just plain old goddamn reckless endangerment. </seg>
<seg id="404"> But I got me a goddamn bartender gonna testify that old Stuntman Mike didn't drink a drop all night and his passenger was left stranded by her date in the goddamn rain no less and she asked him for the fucking ride. </seg>
<seg id="405"> Now on paper it's gonna look like he's just trying to help her out. </seg>
<seg id="406"> I mean that's the way the jury's gonna see it. So what are you gonna do Pop? </seg>
<seg id="407"> Well l can take it upon myself to work the case you know in my off hours. </seg>
<seg id="408"> Search for evidence you know to prove my theory. Alert authorities. Dog that rotten son of a bitch. </seg>
<seg id="409"> Wherever he goes I go. Or I can spend the same goddamn amount of time and energy following the NASCAR circuit. Hmm. I thought about it a lot. </seg>
<seg id="410"> I think l'd have a hell of lot happier life if I did the latter. </seg>
<seg id="411"> And just because I can't punish old... Frankenstein in there for what he's done I'm gonna tell you like the Lord told John. If he ever does it again I can make goddamn sure he don't do it in Texas. </seg>
<seg id="412"> - So are you on the same floor with him? - No he's on the 4th and l'm on the 7th. </seg>
<seg id="413"> - Who's in whose room? - He's in mine. </seg>
<seg id="414"> - And so what happened then? - That was pretty much it. We made out in the hall for about 10 minutes and then I sent him off to his room. - So how's The Rock as a kisser? - Mmm he's damn good! He's got them mushy lips and fingertips. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Mmm l love them mushy lips. And he's a big guy so he spins me around so my back's up against him. Then he takes his big hand and he puts it on my throat tilts my head back and leans over me kisses me from behind. </seg>
<seg id="416"> - Damn that sounds sexy! - Mmm it was sexy. </seg>
<seg id="417"> But then that was it? You sent him off? </seg>
<seg id="418"> How'd he take it? Wait a minute. What are we doing here? </seg>
<seg id="419"> lf I'm gonna power through and pick up Zoë at the airport I need a big-ass cup of coffee. Since you're getting that can you get some more vodka and some more sugar-free Red Bull? </seg>
<seg id="420"> We didn't know you were awake. I'm not awake. l'm asleep. </seg>
<seg id="421"> But get some more vodka and some more sugar-free Red Bull anyway. And some Red Apple Tans. </seg>
<seg id="422"> Damn! I didn't stop to get you bitches groceries! </seg>
<seg id="423"> - You remember how to get to the airport don't you? - Uh-huh. </seg>
<seg id="424"> Well then you should get behind the wheel 'cause you gonna drive. </seg>
<seg id="425"> Motherfuckers! </seg>
<seg id="426"> They ain't got sugar-free Red Bull. They got regular Red Bull and sugar-free G.O. juice. </seg>
<seg id="427"> - G.O. - G.O.! </seg>
<seg id="428"> Where the hell are my keys? Oh here they are. </seg>
<seg id="429"> Oh sorry. l didn't mean to give you a concert there. </seg>
<seg id="430"> No it wasn't you. That guy bumped into my feet when he walked by. </seg>
<seg id="431"> I don't know why but that kind of creeped me out. </seg>
<seg id="432"> Little dick. </seg>
<seg id="433"> Clearly. </seg>
<seg id="434"> Since I'm up I might as well hit the ATM. Get me a fucking smoke. </seg>
<seg id="435"> What? Did you just see the-- What? Nothing honey. </seg>
<seg id="436"> Yello. It's me. Miss me? </seg>
<seg id="437"> Oh you best get your ass off Kim's car. </seg>
<seg id="438"> I've seen Kim sit on it before. Her ass ain't your ass. </seg>
<seg id="439"> Okay. </seg>
<seg id="440"> So I think I'm in this month's issue of Allure. </seg>
<seg id="441"> You got Allure? Magazines by the window. </seg>
<seg id="442"> Here you are! </seg>
<seg id="443"> You hot mama you. </seg>
<seg id="444"> See you in a second. </seg>
<seg id="445"> And you get 15 and change back. Thank you very much. </seg>
<seg id="446"> You know l got other fashion magazines for sale behind the counter. </seg>
<seg id="447"> No that's okay. This'll be all. </seg>
<seg id="448"> - Thought I'd ask. - Thanks anyway. Have a good one. </seg>
<seg id="449"> I got this month's issue of Italian Vogue. </seg>
<seg id="450"> This month's? </seg>
<seg id="451"> Listen to this. </seg>
<seg id="452"> The Circle A clerk has this month's issue of Italian Vogue. </seg>
<seg id="453"> - No way. - Way. </seg>
<seg id="454"> l can't believe a fucking Circle A carries Italian Vogue. </seg>
<seg id="455"> It doesn't. It's his own personal copy. </seg>
<seg id="456"> He'll let it go for 27 bucks. Twenty-seven bucks? </seg>
<seg id="457"> What the fuck do you care? We're talking about fucking per diem here. </seg>
<seg id="458"> Look we found an issue of Italian Vogue in Lebanon Tennessee. We're lucky he's not asking for fucking Krugerrands. I'm getting it and we're splitting it three ways. </seg>
<seg id="459"> What me you and Kim? No Kim doesn't give a shit about Italian Vogue. </seg>
<seg id="460"> But Brandy will come in with us and if she won't Tysla her sister will. </seg>
<seg id="461"> Okay. But if anybody tears out any sheets I want you gotta make color Xerox of those pages. And l'm not talking fucking Kinko's here either okay? You take it to the art department you have them do it fucking right. </seg>
<seg id="462"> Well l'm doing Lindsay Lohan's makeup and she's off for the next three days there's no stunts being filmed during that time so Kim's free and Lee's on a "will notify" for the next four days. </seg>
<seg id="463"> So how's the shoot going? Great. We're having the best time. </seg>
<seg id="464"> The director Cecil Evans is so much fun. </seg>
<seg id="465"> We're making the coolest movie and partying all the time. </seg>
<seg id="466"> Hell yeah. The next job after this one is definitely gonna suck. </seg>
<seg id="467"> So let's hear it ladies. Set romances. Who's getting it off? </seg>
<seg id="468"> That would be Lee and Toolbox. Oh Toolbox. Name sounds promising. </seg>
<seg id="469"> - He's a grip. - What he is is a pervert. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Well he just keeps sounding better and better. </seg>
<seg id="471"> What's his perversion? </seg>
<seg id="472"> He likes to watch me pee. </seg>
<seg id="473"> Lee is sitting on the toilet and Toolbox is watching her pee. </seg>
<seg id="474"> P-I-S-S-l-N-G. </seg>
<seg id="475"> Yeah but not no more. Now she's getting it on with The Rock. </seg>
<seg id="476"> - You're having one off with The Rock? - Not the real Rock. He's this electrician named Bruce. </seg>
<seg id="477"> And Kim started calling him The Rock 'cause he kind of looks like The Rock so now we all just call him The Rock. Oh yeah. This is an all-star crew. </seg>
<seg id="478"> We got a guy who looks like Nick Cage and a guy who looks like Pee-wee Herman too. </seg>
<seg id="479"> Kim dick department. Let's hear it. </seg>
<seg id="480"> Mm-mm. No dick this trip. I got a man. </seg>
<seg id="481"> - How long have you had this boyfriend? - About three months. </seg>
<seg id="482"> Who'd you steal him from? - Nobody. - Kim! Wha-- What? He totally had a girlfriend. </seg>
<seg id="483"> All of Kim's boyfriends start out as somebody else's boyfriend. </seg>
<seg id="484"> I did not steal him. I didn't steal any of them. They just...jumped ship. </seg>
<seg id="485"> So what's your story Abernathy? </seg>
<seg id="486"> Oh Abbie's got the big kahuna. </seg>
<seg id="487"> I had a set crush on Cecil. Set crush? Nigga please! You were his set wife. </seg>
<seg id="488"> "Were" and "had" being the key words here. </seg>
<seg id="489"> Bitch you two are still into each other and you know it. </seg>
<seg id="490"> Yeah well if he's so in love with me then whey did he fuck Daryl Hannah's stand-in? </seg>
<seg id="491"> Ho-ho-ho! Yes men are dogs. Oh it's so funny! </seg>
<seg id="492"> Oh it's so funny! Oh stop acting all hurt. Your ass just mad. Yeah he's a stand-in fucker. </seg>
<seg id="493"> Bitch you need to get over that shit. That was two weeks ago. </seg>
<seg id="494"> Oh well now that you put it like that. </seg>
<seg id="495"> Oh l haven't told you the best part. He fucked her on my birthday. </seg>
<seg id="496"> Oh that's a horse of a different color. Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="497"> Did he know it was your birthday? He's the director. He's kind of busy. </seg>
<seg id="498"> He ate a piece of my birthday cake and he got me a present. Yeah l think he knew. Well what did he get you? </seg>
<seg id="499"> He made me a tape. </seg>
<seg id="500"> He made you a tape? - Yeah. - Wait. </seg>
<seg id="501"> He didn't burn you a CD. He made you a tape? - Yeah. - Oh that is so romantic. Yes. I know what you're gonna say so don't even go there. That sounds like the test of true love to me. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Look I know you guys like him. He's likable but he fucked another woman on my birthday. </seg>
<seg id="503"> How can you not be on my side? </seg>
<seg id="504"> Well l admit that sounds bad. It is bad! </seg>
<seg id="505"> It just sounds like there's a little more to it than that. </seg>
<seg id="506"> - Were you two fucking? - Hell no. </seg>
<seg id="507"> Hello. Is your name Abernathy? Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="508"> The answer to your question is no of course not. </seg>
<seg id="509"> What do you mean "No of course not"? </seg>
<seg id="510"> The reason Cecil hasn't had a girlfriend in six years is because girls will fuck him. And if you fuck Cecil you don't become one of his girlfriends. </seg>
<seg id="511"> Not to say I want to be his girlfriend but if l did want to be his girlfriend if I fucked him I wouldn't be his girlfriend. I'd be one of his regulars. </seg>
<seg id="512"> And l'm just getting too fucking old for that shit. </seg>
<seg id="513"> Have you let him do anything? Yes! </seg>
<seg id="514"> I've let him give me a foot massage and when we go to the movies I've let him hold my hand. </seg>
<seg id="515"> Bitch you might be acting like you 12 years old but he just acting like a man. You need to break that nigga off a piece. </seg>
<seg id="516"> Let me get this straight. - You're not fucking him... - Mm-mm. - you're not sucking him... - Mm-mm. you're not giving him any tongue but Daryl Hannah's stand-in is. Okay can we just take my sex life off the table? </seg>
<seg id="517"> Actually uh it was Cecil's sex life that was on the table and your lack of one. </seg>
<seg id="518"> Ohhh! Fuck both of you and your little high five. </seg>
<seg id="519"> Before you can claim a nigga you got to claim a nigga and you can start by giving that motherfucker a hand job in the back of the van on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="520"> I'm not gonna do that. I know you won't. But you know who will. </seg>
<seg id="521"> The bitch that ends up living in that big-ass mansion of his. </seg>
<seg id="522"> Now I gotta say I haven't entirely agreed with everything Kim said but it is true: if you stretch shit out like you have with Cecil and you suddenly get dirty on them it blows their mind. </seg>
<seg id="523"> So Zoë Kim and I are in the Philippines at an outdoor rave. </seg>
<seg id="524"> - What were you working on? - Three Kicks to the Head Part Three. </seg>
<seg id="525"> And admittedly we're a little fucked-up. </seg>
<seg id="526"> - Cheers to that. - Word. </seg>
<seg id="527"> Cheers. </seg>
<seg id="528"> So Zoë the genius wants to take a picture of me. </seg>
<seg id="529"> It's dark as hell and you can't see shit. </seg>
<seg id="530"> So she's got her camera and keeps saying "Step back a little" so I do. Then "A little further" so l step back a little further. Then "A little more" so l do. </seg>
<seg id="531"> Then I realize I'm right at the edge of a seven-foot concrete ditch with God knows how many rocks and broken bottles and rats in it and if l fell in that fucking thing I'd probably would've broken my fucking neck. </seg>
<seg id="532"> So l'm yelling at her "Zoë you almost killed me!" </seg>
<seg id="533"> So we laugh about it and walk a little further and Zoë starts fucking around and damn if she doesn't fall in the fucking ditch. </seg>
<seg id="534"> Nice. Nice. Thank you. Yep. Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="535"> I remember taking a step and looking down. Just as l'm thinking "There's that ditch Abbie was talking about" bam l'm in the fucking ditch you know? What happened? </seg>
<seg id="536"> What with Zoë the cat? Nothing. </seg>
<seg id="537"> If I fell in that fucking thing they would've had to helicopter me out of there. </seg>
<seg id="538"> Zoë just lands on her feet. </seg>
<seg id="539"> But then later I started feeling a little bad about myself. </seg>
<seg id="540"> Zoë falls in the ditch and it's nothing. </seg>
<seg id="541"> We're laughing about it. </seg>
<seg id="542"> If I fell in that fucking thing I probably would've been fucking paralyzed. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Oh honey you can't think like that. </seg>
<seg id="544"> You know we all have our individual talents and that just happens to be one of Zoë's. </seg>
<seg id="545"> - Yeah. - Well... physically speaking Zoë is amazing. I mean agility reflexes nimbleness. </seg>
<seg id="546"> There's few human beings that can fuck with Zoë on that front. Oh Kim l like you too. </seg>
<seg id="547"> Having said that before you get too envious of Zoë's prowess you're missing the most important part of that story. </seg>
<seg id="548"> You didn't fall in the ditch Zoë did. </seg>
<seg id="549"> Zoë even knew there was a ditch there because you told her and she still fell in. </seg>
<seg id="550"> So Lee's right. We all have our talents. Hey l resemble that remark. </seg>
<seg id="551"> So Kim you still pack a roscoe? </seg>
<seg id="552"> Check it out bitch. - Ooh nice one mate. - I know this. </seg>
<seg id="553"> - What's a roscoe? - A roscoe is a pistol. </seg>
<seg id="554"> - You carry a gun? - Uh-huh. </seg>
<seg id="555"> - You have a license to carry it? - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="556"> When I became a Secret Service agent they gave me a license. </seg>
<seg id="557"> Oh l didn't know you were-- </seg>
<seg id="558"> Okay l didn't say it all right? Stop looking at me. l didn't say it. God! </seg>
<seg id="559"> Did you know Kim carried a gun? Yes. Now do I approve? No. </seg>
<seg id="560"> Do I know? Yes. </seg>
<seg id="561"> Look I don't know what futuristic utopia you live in but the world I live in a bitch need a gun. </seg>
<seg id="562"> You can't get around the fact that people who carry guns tend to get shot more than people who don't. </seg>
<seg id="563"> And you can't get around the fact that if l go down to the laundry room in my building at midnight enough times I might get my ass raped. </seg>
<seg id="564"> Don't do your laundry at midnight. Fuck that. I wanna do my laundry whenever the fuck I wanna do my laundry. </seg>
<seg id="565"> There are other things you can carry other than a gun. </seg>
<seg id="566"> Pepper spray. Uh motherfucker try to rape me I don't wanna give him a skin rash. </seg>
<seg id="567"> I wanna shut that nigga down. </seg>
<seg id="568"> How about a knife at least? </seg>
<seg id="569"> Yeah. You know what happens to motherfuckers carry knives? </seg>
<seg id="570"> They get shot! </seg>
<seg id="571"> Look if l ever become a famous actress I won't carry a gun. </seg>
<seg id="572"> I'll hire me a do-dirt nigga and he'll carry the gun. </seg>
<seg id="573"> And when shit goes down l'll sit back and laugh. But until that day it's Wild West motherfucker. </seg>
<seg id="574"> So Zoë you thought about what you want to do first? </seg>
<seg id="575"> It just so happens I know exactly what l wanna do. </seg>
<seg id="576"> Oh really? And what would that be? </seg>
<seg id="577"> To me there's no point in being in America unless you can drive a Detroit muscle car. </seg>
<seg id="578"> And l wanna drive a Dodge Challenger. Fuck me swinging balls out. </seg>
<seg id="579"> Um well I guess we can talk to Transpo. But does it have to be a Dodge Challenger? Not just that. </seg>
<seg id="580"> It has to be a 1970 Dodge Challenger with a 440 engine. </seg>
<seg id="581"> How in the fuck do you expect to do that? </seg>
<seg id="582"> No worries mate. I've got it all worked out. </seg>
<seg id="583"> When I knew l was coming here l went online and found out that the local paper here in Tennessee is the Lebanon News Sentinel. </seg>
<seg id="584"> - So back home-- - l'm sorry. Where's home? Australia right? </seg>
<seg id="585"> What do you mean by that mate? Zoë's from New Zealand and you never-- I repeat never-- call a Kiwi an Aussie. </seg>
<seg id="586"> That is unless you want your ass kicked. </seg>
<seg id="587"> I'm so sorry. I really am. </seg>
<seg id="588"> Oh it's okay. We're just taking the piss out of you mate. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Auckland to answer your question. </seg>
<seg id="590"> Anyway l subscribed to the local paper a month ago. </seg>
<seg id="591"> Now why the fuck you want a local redneck newspaper in New Zealand? </seg>
<seg id="592"> Pipe down and I'll tell you. </seg>
<seg id="593"> I've been getting the paper for the last month and I've been checking the classified at the back looking at cars for sale. </seg>
<seg id="594"> So as of yesterday for sale in this town some dude is selling a stock with a 440 engine and a white paint job. </seg>
<seg id="595"> And you wanna buy it? </seg>
<seg id="596"> Kim l may be stupid but I'm not bloody stupid. </seg>
<seg id="597"> I wanna say I wanna buy it so he'll let me test-drive it. </seg>
<seg id="598"> A 1970 Dodge Challenger with a white paint job. </seg>
<seg id="599"> - Oh uh Kowalski. - Kowalski from Vanishing Point. </seg>
<seg id="600"> - Mate it's a fucking classic! - Mmm I get it. If I can get this guy to let me drive it without him I will blow the doors off that bitch. </seg>
<seg id="601"> - What's Vanishing Point? - Oh God. "What's Vanishing Point?" </seg>
<seg id="602"> Abs I'm supposed to be the illiterate one. </seg>
<seg id="603"> lt's just one of the best American movies ever made. </seg>
<seg id="604"> Actually Zoë most girls wouldn't know Vanishing Point. </seg>
<seg id="605"> Excuse me. "Most girls"? What the fuck are you two? </seg>
<seg id="606"> Yeah well we're gearheads. Of course we watched it. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Y'all grew up watching that Pretty in Pink shit. </seg>
<seg id="608"> Oh I like Pretty in Pink. </seg>
<seg id="609"> What so you didn't watch John Hughes movies? </seg>
<seg id="610"> Of course l did. I'm a girl. </seg>
<seg id="611"> But l also watched car shit too. </seg>
<seg id="612"> - Vanishing Point Dirty Mary Crazy Larry... - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Gone in 60 Seconds-- </seg>
<seg id="613"> The real one not that Angelina Jolie bullshit. </seg>
<seg id="614"> We have an outdoors theater in Auckland. It plays Vanishing Point Big Wednesday all the classics. </seg>
<seg id="615"> What do you horny gals want? Hey you got a 1970 Dodge Challenger for sale? </seg>
<seg id="616"> Right up here ladies. </seg>
<seg id="617"> This shit is off the fucking hook! </seg>
<seg id="618"> Fucking legendary mate. </seg>
<seg id="619"> Sweet ass. Well if you'll excuse me for a moment I'd just like to have a word alone with my business associate. </seg>
<seg id="620"> - You ladies take your time. </seg>
<seg id="621"> What are you waiting for? Ask him to let you drive it by yourself. - I... I intend to but first I need to ask you something. What? </seg>
<seg id="622"> If he lets us take it out on our own I wanna play ship's mast. - Oh hell no! - Would you keep it down? </seg>
<seg id="623"> - Ain't no way I'm doing ship's mast. - For Christ sakes-- </seg>
<seg id="624"> - Don't blaspheme. - Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="625"> Now what did you say after the last time? </seg>
<seg id="626"> - Look l know what l said-- - What did you say? </seg>
<seg id="627"> - I know I said we shouldn't do this again - No. You didn't say we shouldn't. </seg>
<seg id="628"> You said we ain't ever gonna do that again. - Yeah but -"But" my ass! </seg>
<seg id="629"> You said not only are we never gonna play ship's mast again but you also said if you ever do what you trying to do now to not only refuse but that I had permission to physically restrain your ass if necessary. Now did you or did you not say that? </seg>
<seg id="630"> - Well. - No no no no. Answer the question motherfucker. </seg>
<seg id="631"> Did you or did you not say that? Yes I said that. However... Whatever with your "however." </seg>
<seg id="632"> Look I know l said it and I know I meant it. </seg>
<seg id="633"> Damn skippy you meant it. Yeah but when l said it I didn't mean in America. </seg>
<seg id="634"> - Oh nigga please! - Really-- </seg>
<seg id="635"> I meant we should never play ship's mast again in New Zealand or Australia. </seg>
<seg id="636"> You are such a liar. </seg>
<seg id="637"> Look I know what l said when I said it. But when I said it l didn't know I'd ever come to America. </seg>
<seg id="638"> And when I said it if l had known I was going to come to America and had the opportunity to play ship's mast with a fucking Vanishing Point Challenger I would've added a "however." Right? </seg>
<seg id="639"> Okay oddly enough I actually understood that. </seg>
<seg id="640"> However just because you talked yourself into some stupid shit doesn't mean I have lost my goddamn mind. </seg>
<seg id="641"> You need two people to play ship's mast and I ain't playing. </seg>
<seg id="642"> I'll be your best friend. </seg>
<seg id="643"> l don't need me no best friend lives on the other side of planet Earth. </seg>
<seg id="644"> - I'll crack your back. - You'll crack it anyway. </seg>
<seg id="645"> Well of course I'll crack it anyway. </seg>
<seg id="646"> But now while l'm here I'll be your back-cracking slave. </seg>
<seg id="647"> Whenever you want it you got it. You don't even have to ask for it. </seg>
<seg id="648"> You just order me to do it. Just be like... </seg>
<seg id="649"> "Bitch get over here and get busy." - You crack my back you'll give me foot massages... - Mm-hmm. Mmm. and after a shower you put moisturizer on my butt. Deal. </seg>
<seg id="650"> So we're gonna see if this guy'll let us take the car out without him. </seg>
<seg id="651"> If he does you wait here with Lee and we'll be back in a moment. </seg>
<seg id="652"> What? </seg>
<seg id="653"> I said we're gonna see if this guy'll let us take the car out without him. I heard what you said. I just can't believe what you said. </seg>
<seg id="654"> You know you two got some fucking balls. What? </seg>
<seg id="655"> Don't play dumbass with me. I've been up all night. I'm still a little drunk and I have a hangover. </seg>
<seg id="656"> l should be in my hotel room asleep not fucking around here on Tobacco Road. But because Zoë wanted to drive some fucking Vanishing Point car I'm here. </seg>
<seg id="657"> Now you two got the balls to ask me no scratch that, tell me l gotta go make conversation with Tom Joad while the cool kids get to go out and play? </seg>
<seg id="658"> Bullshit on that. - lt ain't like that. - Then what's it like Kim? </seg>
<seg id="659"> You guys are our collateral. He is never gonna go for it if we all go. </seg>
<seg id="660"> I really think one human being will be collateral enough. </seg>
<seg id="661"> You're not gonna wanna do what we're doing. What drive a car? </seg>
<seg id="662"> - Mmm. - We're doing more than that. What drive it fast? </seg>
<seg id="663"> We're doing more than that. Actually we're paying you a compliment 'cause we gonna do some stupid shit. But that's okay. We're stunt people. We ain't got good sense. </seg>
<seg id="664"> But you got good sense and anybody with good sense ain't gonna wanna do what we're doing. </seg>
<seg id="665"> How do you know I don't wanna do it? - 'Cause you're a mom. - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="666"> You know we're supposed to be this big posse but that's the excuse you guys use whenever you want to exclude me from something. </seg>
<seg id="667"> So what is it you two daredevils are doing that I'm just so uncool I couldn't possibly understand? </seg>
<seg id="668"> You know we're kind of conning this guy so maybe it's best that we don't go into detail about it while he's watching us. </seg>
<seg id="669"> Besides he's probably not gonna let us do it anyway. </seg>
<seg id="670"> Okay. How about this? </seg>
<seg id="671"> I'll talk him into it. But if l talk him into it I go along. </seg>
<seg id="672"> - How you gonna do that? - Eh that's my problem. </seg>
<seg id="673"> But don't worry. He'll say yes. </seg>
<seg id="674"> What are you gonna do blow him? </seg>
<seg id="675"> No! </seg>
<seg id="676"> l'm gonna insinuate that Lee's gonna blow him. </seg>
<seg id="677"> That's good. Not really. But let me handle it. We got a deal? </seg>
<seg id="678"> Okay Mommy listen up. </seg>
<seg id="679"> You wanna hang with the cool kids you got to be cool. </seg>
<seg id="680"> We take you along you don't say shit.You don't even say crap. </seg>
<seg id="681"> You just sit in the back and I don't wanna hear a peep out of your ass you understand? - Got it. </seg>
<seg id="682"> You start nagging us we're pulling over to the side of the road kicking your ass out and picking you up later. </seg>
<seg id="683"> Agreed. Okay. Go work your magic. </seg>
<seg id="684"> - Hello sir. - Hello! - Hello. What's your name? - Jasper. </seg>
<seg id="685"> Hello Jasper. I'm Abernathy. - Aber... what? - Abernathy. </seg>
<seg id="686"> - What's your first name? - That is my first name. </seg>
<seg id="687"> What kind of first name is that? You know what? Just call me Abbie. Okay Abbie. </seg>
<seg id="688"> Jasper we were wondering if my friends and I could take the car out for a little test-drive out on our own. You know just to see if we're comfortable in it. </seg>
<seg id="689"> Why would I do something stupid like that? To better sell your automobile. </seg>
<seg id="690"> How do I know y'all ain't just gonna steal it? </seg>
<seg id="691"> Four reasons actually. One we're not thieves. Two that would be rude. Three we're staying at the Days lnn in town. </seg>
<seg id="692"> You can call the hotel check with management. We're registered for the next month. </seg>
<seg id="693"> Actually Zoë's not. But Kim and I are so we're totally track-downable. </seg>
<seg id="694"> Who's Kim? The colored girl? Yes. Kim would be the girl of color. </seg>
<seg id="695"> And reason number four and the most important while we're taking the car out for a little spin that'll give you a better opportunity to get acquainted with our other friend Lee. </seg>
<seg id="696"> Why does she look kind of familiar? </seg>
<seg id="697"> That would be because she's a famous actress. Oh. </seg>
<seg id="698"> Why is she dressed like that? Well you see we're making a Hollywood movie in town and it's a cheerleader movie and she's one of the cheerleaders. </seg>
<seg id="699"> What's a cheerleader movie? A movie about cheerleaders. </seg>
<seg id="700"> Is it a porno movie? Yes it is. </seg>
<seg id="701"> But don't mention it. She's shy. </seg>
<seg id="702"> Lee this is Jasper. Jasper Lee. </seg>
<seg id="703"> Now you two kids stay out of trouble. </seg>
<seg id="704"> Hey good-lookin' be back to pick you up later. </seg>
<seg id="705"> Ta-ta! </seg>
<seg id="706"> Gulp. </seg>
<seg id="707"> You thinking what I'm thinking? </seg>
<seg id="708"> I think l'm thinking it. What are you and you thinking? </seg>
<seg id="709"> I'm thinking we told your ass to shut the fuck up. </seg>
<seg id="710"> - Where y'all going? - You stay put. </seg>
<seg id="711"> I gotta take a... So you ready to do this? </seg>
<seg id="712"> You sure? Well l always don't wanna do it right before I'm gonna do it. </seg>
<seg id="713"> You know what l mean? Yeah l know what you mean 'cause l don't wanna do it. </seg>
<seg id="714"> - Kim... - I'm just saying. </seg>
<seg id="715"> Look if you're gonna take the piss out of it. I'm just saying. </seg>
<seg id="716"> You wanna start out on top? </seg>
<seg id="717"> Practically doesn't count if you start on the top. </seg>
<seg id="718"> Here are your gloves. </seg>
<seg id="719"> No no no no. I'm wearing the jacket. This is my jacket. </seg>
<seg id="720"> Um ain't you 'posed to be my slave or some shit? </seg>
<seg id="721"> - Come on. - I'm the one who's on the fucking bonnet! "Bonnet" my ass. You on the hood. </seg>
<seg id="722"> Y'all I think I hear a car coming! Give me your belt. Oh. </seg>
<seg id="723"> But this is my cute shit. - Well. - Fuck that. </seg>
<seg id="724"> Get Abernathy's belt. Fine. We'll use Abbie's belt. </seg>
<seg id="725"> - Give me your belt. - No. - Prada. - Come on give her the belt. Magic word. </seg>
<seg id="726"> Please give her the belt. Just 'cause you asked nicely. </seg>
<seg id="727"> - lt's nice to be nice Kim! - Whatever. </seg>
<seg id="728"> You know what? Don't even fucking think about asking me next time you want me to do your hair. </seg>
<seg id="729"> Your ass gonna do it. </seg>
<seg id="730"> Yeah and you'll ask "pretty please" bitch because that's what you do when no one else is looking. </seg>
<seg id="731"> You ain't that fucking hard. I ain't getting that shit. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Abernathy don't get on my nerves right now. </seg>
<seg id="733"> I got shit on my mind. Ooh! You know I ain't six. </seg>

<seg id="6"> Just a moment, if I may. We do not yet know the cause of death. </seg>
<seg id="7"> When you find them in the river, cause of death is drowning. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Possibly so, if there is water in the lungs, but by pathology we might be able to determine whether or not he was dead before he went into the river. </seg>
<seg id="9"> I will need to examine the body. Cut him up. Are we heathens? </seg>
<seg id="10"> What happened to him? Nothing, sir. Arrested for burglary. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Good work. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The millennium is almost upon us. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In a few months, we will be living in the 19th century, yet our courts continue to rely on medieval devices of torture. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Stand down! I stand up for sense and justice. Our jails overflow with men and women convicted on confessions worth no more than this one. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Constable Crane! </seg>
<seg id="16"> This is a song that we have heard from you more than once. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Now, there are two courses open to me. </seg>
<seg id="18"> First, I can let you cool your heels in the cells until you learn respect for the dignity of my office. </seg>
<seg id="19"> I beg pardon. But why am I the only one who sees that, to solve crimes, to detect the guilty, we must use our brains to recognize vital clues, using up-to-date scientific techniques? </seg>
<seg id="20"> Which brings me to the second course. There is a town upstate, two days' journey to the north in the Hudson Highlands. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It is a place called Sleepy Hollow. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Have you heard of it? I have not. </seg>
<seg id="23"> An isolated farming community, mainly Dutch. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Three persons have been murdered there, all within a fortnight. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Each one found with the head lopped off. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Lopped off? Clean as dandelion heads, apparently. </seg>
<seg id="27"> You will take these experimentations of yours to Sleepy Hollow and there you will detect the murderer. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Bring him here to face our good justice. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Will you do this? I shall. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Remember, it is you, Ichabod Crane, who is now put to the test. </seg>
<seg id="31"> "The Pickety Witch, the Pickety Witch </seg>
<seg id="32"> "Who's got a kiss for the Pickety Witch? </seg>
<seg id="33"> "The Pickety Witch, the Pickety Witch "Who's got a kiss for the Pickety Witch?" </seg>
<seg id="34"> Is it Theodore? No, pardon, miss. I am only a stranger. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Then have a kiss on account. </seg>
<seg id="36"> I'm looking for Baltus Van Tassel. </seg>
<seg id="37"> I'm his daughter, Katrina Van Tassel. </seg>
<seg id="38"> And who are you, friend? We have not heard your name yet. I've not said it. Excuse me. </seg>
<seg id="39"> You need some manners. We'll have no raised voices. </seg>
<seg id="40"> It is only to raise spirits during this dark time that I and my dear wife are giving this little party. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Young sir, you are most welcome, even if you are selling something. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Thank you, sir. I am Constable Ichabod Crane, sent to you from New York to investigate murder in Sleepy Hollow. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Then Sleepy Hollow is grateful to you, Constable Crane. </seg>
<seg id="44"> And we hope you will honor us by remaining in this house. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Well spoke, dear. Come, sir, we'll get you settled. Play on! </seg>
<seg id="46"> Excuse me, please. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Thank you. Please tell Mr. Van Tassel I will be down in a moment. </seg>
<seg id="48"> I will, sir. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Thank God you're here. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Excellent. Come in. Leave us, my dear. </seg>
<seg id="51"> We are joined by Dr. Thomas Lancaster, Reverend Steenwyck, our able Magistrate Samuel Philipse, and lastly, this fine fellow is James Hardenbrook, our notary. </seg>
<seg id="52"> And you, sir? </seg>
<seg id="53"> A simple farmer who has prospered. </seg>
<seg id="54"> The town looks to me as friend and counsel. </seg>
<seg id="55"> And landlord and banker. Can we proceed? </seg>
<seg id="56"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="57"> So... Three persons murdered. </seg>
<seg id="58"> First, Peter Van Garrett and his son, Dirk Van Garrett. Both of them strong, capable men, found together decapitated. </seg>
<seg id="59"> One week later, the Widow Winship. Also decapitated. </seg>
<seg id="60"> Now, I will need to ask you many questions. </seg>
<seg id="61"> But first, let me ask, is anyone suspected? </seg>
<seg id="62"> How much have your superiors explained to you, Constable? </seg>
<seg id="63"> Only that the three were slain in open ground, </seg>
<seg id="64"> their heads found severed from their bodies. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Their heads were not found at all. </seg>
<seg id="66"> The heads are gone? </seg>
<seg id="67"> Taken. Taken by the Headless Horseman. Taken back to hell. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Pardon, I don't... Perhaps you had better sit down. </seg>
<seg id="69"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="70"> The horseman was a Hessian mercenary sent to these shores by German princes to keep Americans under the yoke of England. </seg>
<seg id="71"> But unlike his compatriots, who came for money, the horseman came for love of carnage. </seg>
<seg id="72"> When battle was joined, there you'd find him. </seg>
<seg id="73"> He rode a giant black steed named Daredevil. </seg>
<seg id="74"> He was infamous for riding his horse hard into battle, chopping off heads at full gallop. </seg>
<seg id="75"> He had filed his teeth down to sharp points to add to the ferocity of his appearance. </seg>
<seg id="76"> This butcher didn't finally reach his end until the winter of '79 not far from here in our Western Woods. </seg>
<seg id="77"> They chopped off his head with his own sword. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Even today, the Western Woods is a haunted place where brave men will not venture. </seg>
<seg id="79"> For what was planted in the ground that day was a seed of evil. </seg>
<seg id="80"> And so it has been for 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="81"> But now the Hessian wakes. He's on the rampage, cutting off heads where he finds them. </seg>
<seg id="82"> Are you saying... Is that what you believe? </seg>
<seg id="83"> Seeing is believing. </seg>
<seg id="84"> They tell me that you've brought books and trappings of scientific investigation. </seg>
<seg id="85"> This is the only book I recommend you read. </seg>
<seg id="86"> I see. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Reverend Steenwyck. Gentlemen. Murder needs no ghosts to come from the grave. </seg>
<seg id="88"> We have murders in New York without benefit of ghouls and goblins. </seg>
<seg id="89"> You're a long way from New York, Constable. </seg>
<seg id="90"> The assassin is a man of flesh and blood and I will discover him. </seg>
<seg id="91"> Come out, devil. </seg>
<seg id="92"> His name's Gunpowder. He should do just fine, Mr. Killian. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Thank you. Good luck, sir. If you need help, you call my name. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Much appreciated. </seg>
<seg id="95"> Now, don't you worry about a thing. Everything's going to be just fine. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Thomas! Inside! </seg>
<seg id="97"> Run along for your breakfast. Kiss your mother once for you and twice for me. </seg>
<seg id="98"> Murder! The horseman's killed again! </seg>
<seg id="99"> All right, Gunpowder, we're off. Come on. </seg>
<seg id="100"> No, no. Come on, the other way. No, no. Turn around. </seg>
<seg id="101"> Good horsy. </seg>
<seg id="102"> - Mr. Miller, ride back for the coffin cart. - Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="103"> The rest of you keep a sharp lookout. </seg>
<seg id="104"> It's all right. I'm here now. </seg>
<seg id="105"> The fourth victim, Jonathan Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="106"> I see. </seg>
<seg id="107"> And the head? </seg>
<seg id="108"> Taken. </seg>
<seg id="109"> Interesting. Very interesting. What is? </seg>
<seg id="110"> In headless-corpse cases of this sort, the head is removed to prevent identification of the body. </seg>
<seg id="111"> But we know this was Jonathan Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="112"> Precisely. So why was the head removed? </seg>
<seg id="113"> - Why? - Right. </seg>
<seg id="114"> - You have moved the body? - I did. </seg>
<seg id="115"> - You must never move the body! - Why not? </seg>
<seg id="116"> Because. </seg>
<seg id="117"> The stride is gigantic. </seg>
<seg id="118"> The attacker rode Masbath down, turned his horse, came back. Came back to claim the head. </seg>
<seg id="119"> Yes. There's a chemical reaction. </seg>
<seg id="120"> It shows there was a powerful, singular thrust to the neck. </seg>
<seg id="121"> - Interesting. - What is it? </seg>
<seg id="122"> The wound was cauterized in the very instant, as though the blade itself were red hot. And yet, no blistering, no scorched flesh. The Devil's fire. </seg>
<seg id="123"> "Be vigilant," as it sayeth in the Book of Peter, chapter five, verse eight. "Because your adversary the devil, "as a roaring lion, walketh about, "seeking whom he may devour." </seg>
<seg id="124"> God rest Jonathan Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="125"> Amen. Mr. Constable, sir. You're young Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="126"> I was young Masbath, but now the only one. </seg>
<seg id="127"> Masbath, at your service. In honor bound to avenge my father. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Well, one and only Masbath, I thank you very much, but your mother will need you more than I. </seg>
<seg id="129"> My mother is in heaven, sir. </seg>
<seg id="130"> She has my father now to care for her. But you have no one to serve you. I am your man, sir. Yes, and a brave one, too. But I cannot be the one to look after you. </seg>
<seg id="131"> I'm sorry for your loss, young Mr. Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="132"> - Constable Crane. - Mr. Philipse? </seg>
<seg id="133"> Something you should know. </seg>
<seg id="134"> Jonathan Masbath was not the fourth victim, - but the fifth. - The fifth? Aye. Five victims in four graves. </seg>
<seg id="135"> Young Masbath. Find a place in the Van Tassel's servants' quarters. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Wake me before dawn. I hope you have a strong stomach. </seg>
<seg id="137"> Peter Van Garrett. Dirk Van Garrett. </seg>
<seg id="138"> Jonathan Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="139"> There are five victims, four graves. </seg>
<seg id="140"> The Widow Winship. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Bring the Widow in. </seg>
<seg id="142"> This is most irregular, Constable. I should hope so, Doctor, but in this case, necessary. </seg>
<seg id="143"> We need to operate immediately. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Operate? She's dead. </seg>
<seg id="145"> When we say "operate," we mean, of course, I will need the operating table. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Once more, the neck wound cauterized. </seg>
<seg id="147"> The sword thrust to the stomach, the same. </seg>
<seg id="148"> But to what purpose? </seg>
<seg id="149"> To what is your purpose is the question. </seg>
<seg id="150"> What manner of instruments are these? Some of my own design. </seg>
<seg id="151"> All right, then. Step outside, young Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Thank you very, very much for your help, Mr. Killian. And if you don't mind, Doctor, my concentration suffers greatly when I'm observed. </seg>
<seg id="153"> I am finished. What in the name of God have you done to her? </seg>
<seg id="154"> We are dealing with a madman. </seg>
<seg id="155"> What did you find out, Constable? </seg>
<seg id="156"> The Widow Winship was with child. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Who's there? </seg>
<seg id="158"> Oh, pardon my intrusion. It is no intrusion. </seg>
<seg id="159"> I come here to read when I am wakeful. </seg>
<seg id="160"> To read books which you must hide? They were my mother's books. My father believes tales of romance caused the brain fever that killed my mother. </seg>
<seg id="161"> She died two years ago come midwinter. </seg>
<seg id="162"> The nurse who cared for her during her sickness is now Lady Van Tassel. </seg>
<seg id="163"> There was something else, too. Why did no one think to mention that the Van Garretts are kith and kin to the Van Tassels? </seg>
<seg id="164"> Why, because there is hardly a household in Sleepy Hollow that is not connected to every other by blood or marriage. </seg>
<seg id="165"> I see. </seg>
<seg id="166"> This land we're looking at was Van Garrett land, given to my father when I was in swaddling clothes. The Van Garretts were the richest family around these parts. </seg>
<seg id="167"> When my father brought us to Sleepy Hollow, Van Garrett set him up with an acre and a broken-down cottage. My father worked hard for his family, and prospered and built this house. And I owe my happiness to him. </seg>
<seg id="168"> I remember living poor in the cottage. </seg>
<seg id="169"> Should I show you? Yes. </seg>
<seg id="170"> Take this. It is my gift for you. </seg>
<seg id="171"> No, I have no use for it. Are you so certain of everything? </seg>
<seg id="172"> It was your mother's. Keep it close to your heart. It is sure protection against harm. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Are you so certain of everything? </seg>
<seg id="174"> These are strange. These markings, what are they? I've had them since I can remember. </seg>
<seg id="175"> I used to play by this hearth as a child. </seg>
<seg id="176"> It was my first drawing school, and my mother was my teacher. </seg>
<seg id="177"> Oh, look. See? Carved into the fire back? The archer. I'd forgotten it. </seg>
<seg id="178"> This was from long before we lived here. </seg>
<seg id="179"> - Are you all right? - Yes, thank you. </seg>
<seg id="180"> A cardinal. My favorite. </seg>
<seg id="181"> I'd love to have a tame one, but I wouldn't have the heart to cage him. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Well, then I have something for you. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Cardinal on one side. An empty cage. </seg>
<seg id="184"> And now... </seg>
<seg id="185"> You can do magic. Teach me. </seg>
<seg id="186"> It is no magic. It is what we call optics. Separate pictures which become one in the spinning. </seg>
<seg id="187"> It is truth, but truth is not always appearance. </seg>
<seg id="188"> What are you running from, Magistrate Philipse? Damn you, Crane. </seg>
<seg id="189"> - You had a mind to help me? - Yes, and it's put me in mortal dread of... Of powers against which there is no defense. Come. </seg>
<seg id="190"> How did you know the Widow Winship was expecting a child? </seg>
<seg id="191"> She told me. - Then I deduce you are the father. - I'm not the father. Did she tell you the name of the child's father? </seg>
<seg id="192"> Yes, she did. She came to me for advice as town magistrate to protect the rights of her child. </seg>
<seg id="193"> I was bound by my oath of office to keep the secret, but... </seg>
<seg id="194"> Do you believe the father killed her? The Horseman killed her. </seg>
<seg id="195"> How often do I have to tell you? There is no Horseman. </seg>
<seg id="196"> What is that thing? My talisman. It protects me from the Horseman. </seg>
<seg id="197"> You, a magistrate, and your head full of such nonsense. Now, tell me the name of... </seg>
<seg id="198"> Oh, my God. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Constable Crane? Constable Crane? </seg>
<seg id="200"> Has he not come out at all? </seg>
<seg id="201"> - It was a headless horseman. - You must not excite yourself. </seg>
<seg id="202"> But it was a headless horseman! Of course it was. That's why you're here. </seg>
<seg id="203"> No, you must believe me. It was a horseman, a dead one. Headless. </seg>
<seg id="204"> I know. I know. You don't know because you were not there! It's all true. </seg>
<seg id="205"> Of course it is. I told you. Everyone told you. </seg>
<seg id="206"> I saw him. </seg>
<seg id="207"> I suppose it's back to the city, then. </seg>
<seg id="208"> All right, this time I'll go to New York myself. </seg>
<seg id="209"> I won't be fobbed off with an amateur deductor. </seg>
<seg id="210"> This time, it's a magistrate that's dead and... </seg>
<seg id="211"> Gentlemen. I need able men to go with me into the Western Woods. </seg>
<seg id="212"> You? We thought you'd shot your bolt. </seg>
<seg id="213"> I have faced my fears, and come out determined to locate the Horseman's grave. </seg>
<seg id="214"> In short, to pit myself against a murdering ghost. </seg>
<seg id="215"> Who's with me? </seg>
<seg id="216"> Me. </seg>
<seg id="217"> The Van Garretts, Widow Winship, your father, Jonathan Masbath, and now Philipse. Something must connect them. </seg>
<seg id="218"> Did your father have dealings with the Van Garretts? </seg>
<seg id="219"> He worked for them. We lived in the coach house. It's nothing. </seg>
<seg id="220"> But there was something that happened one night, a week before the murder. An argument upstairs between father and son. </seg>
<seg id="221"> And my father was later sent for by Mr. Van Garrett. </seg>
<seg id="222"> An argument between father and son. </seg>
<seg id="223"> After which the elder Van Garrett sent for his servant Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="224"> Listen. </seg>
<seg id="225"> - I hear nothing. - Nor I. </seg>
<seg id="226"> No birds. No crickets. It's all gone so quiet. </seg>
<seg id="227"> Quicken pace. </seg>
<seg id="228"> Pardon our intrusion, - but perhaps you could help us? - You're from the Hollow. Yes. In a way, yes. </seg>
<seg id="229"> I should like to say that I make no assumptions about your occupation. </seg>
<seg id="230"> Nor your ways, which, which, which are nothing to me, whatever you are. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Each to his own. Oh. Do you know of the Horseman, ma'am? The Hessian? </seg>
<seg id="232"> That'll be him, ma'am. You, come with me. Go out, child. Keep away. Whatever you hear, keep away. </seg>
<seg id="233"> What might he hear that he must keep away from? </seg>
<seg id="234"> He rides. To the Hollow and back. - I hear him. I smell the blood on him. - Do you? </seg>
<seg id="235"> Well, I'm here to find him and make him stop. You seek knowledge of the netherworld? I can show you. </seg>
<seg id="236"> - What are you doing? - Do not move or speak. </seg>
<seg id="237"> When the other comes, I will hold him. </seg>
<seg id="238"> - The other? - Silence. He comes now. </seg>
<seg id="239"> Madam? Madam, do you hear me? </seg>
<seg id="240"> You seek the warrior bathed in blood, the Headless Horseman. </seg>
<seg id="241"> Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies. Follow it to the Tree of the Dead. Climb down to the Horseman's resting place. </seg>
<seg id="242"> We're leaving. </seg>
<seg id="243"> We take the Indian trail to the Tree of the Dead. </seg>
<seg id="244"> - How will we recognize it? - Without difficulty, I rather fear. </seg>
<seg id="245"> We climb down to the Horseman's resting place. </seg>
<seg id="246"> - His camp? - His grave. </seg>
<seg id="247"> Stay here. </seg>
<seg id="248"> Halt and turn, I have a pistol aimed. </seg>
<seg id="249"> Katrina? I might have killed you. Why have you come? </seg>
<seg id="250"> Because no one else would go with you. </seg>
<seg id="251"> Well, then I am now twice the man. It is your white magic. </seg>
<seg id="252"> The Tree of the Dead. </seg>
<seg id="253"> Blood. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Stay where you are. </seg>
<seg id="255"> - What is it? - Just stay where you are. Don't move. </seg>
<seg id="256"> This tree is a gateway. A gateway between two worlds. </seg>
<seg id="257"> This ground has been disturbed. The soil is loose. </seg>
<seg id="258"> Bring the shovel. </seg>
<seg id="259"> The skull is gone. Taken. </seg>
<seg id="260"> That is why the Horseman returns from the grave. </seg>
<seg id="261"> To take heads till his own is restored to him. </seg>
<seg id="262"> Ichabod? </seg>
<seg id="263"> Split up. Glenn. Theodore. </seg>
<seg id="264"> Don't pick your teeth, you'll teach Thomas bad habits. </seg>
<seg id="265"> - I am a bad habit. There's nothing for it. - Oh, isn't there? - Come on, let's get ready for bed. - Yes. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Beth, run! </seg>
<seg id="267"> Stay quiet. </seg>
<seg id="268"> - Wait! He's not after you. - I'll get him. </seg>
<seg id="269"> We cannot win this. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Remarkable. A wound like this should've killed him. </seg>
<seg id="271"> But it needs no stitch, and there's hardly a loss of blood. </seg>
<seg id="272"> You must be still. The fever is on you. </seg>
<seg id="273"> Katrina. </seg>
<seg id="274"> Nostradamus mediamus, milk of mercy, in media nos laudamas. </seg>
<seg id="275"> Katrina, I tried to stop Brom, but... </seg>
<seg id="276"> Drink this down. It'll make you sleep. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The Horseman was not set to kill Brom or me. Had Brom not attacked him... </seg>
<seg id="278"> Later. Rest now. </seg>
<seg id="279"> I've discovered something. The Horseman does not kill at random. </seg>
<seg id="280"> His victims are chosen by someone who controls him. </seg>
<seg id="281"> By that very person who took his skull. </seg>
<seg id="282"> Someone who knew where to dig. </seg>
<seg id="283"> Someone of flesh and blood, as I've always said. - These are ravings. - Drink. </seg>
<seg id="284"> - You were dreaming. - Yes. </seg>
<seg id="285"> Things I had forgotten. </seg>
<seg id="286"> - And would not like to remember. - Tell me what you dreamt. </seg>
<seg id="287"> My mother was an innocent. A child of nature. </seg>
<seg id="288"> Condemned. Murdered. By my father. </seg>
<seg id="289"> - Murdered by... - Murdered to save her soul by a Bible-black tyrant behind a mask of righteousness. </seg>
<seg id="290"> I was seven when I lost my faith. </seg>
<seg id="291"> What do you believe in? </seg>
<seg id="292"> Sense and reason. Cause and consequence. I should not have come to this place, where my rational mind has been so controverted by the spirit world. Will you take nothing from Sleepy Hollow that was worth the coming here? </seg>
<seg id="293"> No. No, not nothing. </seg>
<seg id="294"> A kiss from a lovely young woman, before she saw my face or knew my name. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Yes, without sense or reason. </seg>
<seg id="296"> Forgive me, I speak of kisses </seg>
<seg id="297"> and you've lost your brave man, Brom. I have shed my tears for Brom, and yet my heart is not broken. - Do you think me wicked? - No. </seg>
<seg id="298"> But perhaps there is a bit of a witch in you, Katrina. - Why do you say that? - Because you have bewitched me. </seg>
<seg id="299"> - You slept like the dead. - You're too kind to me. </seg>
<seg id="300"> I do not look to be served by the lady of the house. Nor would you be, but that the servant girl has vanished. - Sarah? - Run away like so many others. They're all leaving in fear. </seg>
<seg id="301"> Where is Katrina? She watched over you till dawn. Now it is her turn to sleep. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Well, I'm fit for another day, I think. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Fit enough to face a mortal adversary. </seg>
<seg id="304"> Doctor Lancaster, Reverend Steenwyck, Notary Hardenbrook, and Magistrate Philipse. Who tried to cut and run, and lost his head. </seg>
<seg id="305"> There is conspiracy here. </seg>
<seg id="306"> The doctor, the reverend, the notary and the magistrate. </seg>
<seg id="307"> What is this secret that unites them? </seg>
<seg id="308"> Magistrate Philipse knew there were five bodies to four graves. He knew the Widow was pregnant. He would not tell me the name of the father. </seg>
<seg id="309"> What does this point to? </seg>
<seg id="310"> We must proceed by a process of elimination. </seg>
<seg id="311"> I shall make a list of every man and woman in Sleepy Hollow, starting with its chief citizen, Baltus Van Tassel. </seg>
<seg id="312"> I feel we're getting very close. Yes, I suppose Baltus is the chief citizen, now that old Van Garrett is dead. Yes, the Van Garretts. I'd almost forgotten them. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Come with me. - Where? - To Notary Hardenbrook's. - Have you thought of something? - Yes. I have. </seg>
<seg id="314"> Hopeless. </seg>
<seg id="315"> My father's satchel. Why is it here? </seg>
<seg id="316"> - Leave me alone. - Notary Hardenbrook. </seg>
<seg id="317"> Just as soon as you show me the last will and testament of old man Van Garrett. The will leaves everything to his son. Who died with him. So the estate passes to the next of kin. </seg>
<seg id="318"> - Naturally. All legal and above board. - Sir. I'm a dead man. No. </seg>
<seg id="319"> Van Garrett's seal. Broken. </seg>
<seg id="320"> Seems Van Garrett made a new will just before he died. Naming Widow Winship? </seg>
<seg id="321"> And here, look. A marriage certificate. </seg>
<seg id="322"> Old Van Garrett secretly married the Widow. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Left everything to her and her unborn child. </seg>
<seg id="324"> So the new will stood between the Van Garrett fortune and the person who would have otherwise inherited everything. It's true. But we four were drawn in against our will. </seg>
<seg id="325"> - Your will? - He means... </seg>
<seg id="326"> Of course. The four town elders. </seg>
<seg id="327"> Now I see what parts you had to play. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Reverend Steenwyck knew the secret because he performed the marriage. Dr. Lancaster attended the pregnant woman. Magistrate Philipse gave protection of the law. And Notary Hardenbrook concealed the documents, which had been entrusted by Van Garrett to his faithful servant. </seg>
<seg id="329"> The four conspirators drawn into the plot. </seg>
<seg id="330"> We did not know it was a murdering plot. </seg>
<seg id="331"> But I have not finished, sir. </seg>
<seg id="332"> First, the Van Garretts, father and son, slain by a horseman raised from the grave to chop heads. </seg>
<seg id="333"> Now, up pops a widow with a claim on a fortune. Off with her head! But murder begets murder. </seg>
<seg id="334"> It was the servant, Jonathan Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="335"> The night father and son quarreled over the new will, </seg>
<seg id="336"> Jonathan Masbath was summoned upstairs to bear witness. </seg>
<seg id="337"> Here is his signature. I'm afraid it was his death warrant, young Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="338"> The Horseman came for him. </seg>
<seg id="339"> Came for him at the bidding of someone who had power over him. </seg>
<seg id="340"> Someone who dug in the earth in the Western Woods and stole the skull. </seg>
<seg id="341"> The missing head, which must be restored to the Horseman before he will return to Hell. </seg>
<seg id="342"> Someone who stood to gain or lose a fortune. </seg>
<seg id="343"> None other than Van Garrett's next of kin, Baltus Van Tassel! </seg>
<seg id="344"> - Katrina? Why are you in my room? - Because it is yours. </seg>
<seg id="345"> - Was it wicked of me? - No. </seg>
<seg id="346"> I missed you. Where did you go? To the notary. </seg>
<seg id="347"> I had questions to ask Hardenbrook. And did you learn anything of interest? </seg>
<seg id="348"> Perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="349"> - My father... - Your father? Yes. My father thinks you should return to New York. Really? Why is that? </seg>
<seg id="350"> I don't know. Perhaps he looked in your ledger and did not like what he saw. </seg>
<seg id="351"> - What have you there? - Evidence. I'm sorry, I must ask you... </seg>
<seg id="352"> Then I'll leave you to your thoughts. </seg>
<seg id="353"> - It's just a spider. - Kill it! Kill it! No, no, stomp it! </seg>
<seg id="354"> - There's something under here. - What is it? </seg>
<seg id="355"> - Help me move the bed. - No, no, I mustn't. You do it. </seg>
<seg id="356"> The evil eye. It is someone casting spells against you. </seg>
<seg id="357"> The evil eye? </seg>
<seg id="358"> Wait here. </seg>
<seg id="359"> Katrina, you took the evidence and burned it. So you would not have it to accuse my father. </seg>
<seg id="360"> I accuse no one. But if there is guilt, I cannot alter it, no matter how much it grieves me. And no spells of yours can alter it, either. </seg>
<seg id="361"> Your father has the motive. It is he who stands to profit from these murders. </seg>
<seg id="362"> If you knew him, you would not have such harsh thoughts about him. </seg>
<seg id="363"> No, nor if you felt anything for me. I am pinioned by a chain of reasoning. </seg>
<seg id="364"> Why else did his four friends conspire to conceal... You are the constable, not I. </seg>
<seg id="365"> So find another chain of reasoning and let me be. </seg>
<seg id="366"> I cannot, not the one or the other. And I am heartsick with it. I think you have no heart. And I had a mind once to give you mine. </seg>
<seg id="367"> Yes, I think you loved me that day when you followed me into the Western Woods to have braved such peril. </seg>
<seg id="368"> What peril was there for me, if it was my own father who controlled the Headless Horseman? </seg>
<seg id="369"> Goodbye, Ichabod Crane. I curse the day you came to Sleepy Hollow. </seg>
<seg id="370"> - She will not see you. - Did she say anything? </seg>
<seg id="371"> Only that she will not come down. </seg>
<seg id="372"> I see. Thank you. Constable? </seg>
<seg id="373"> You have not asked me how I have hurt my hand since yesterday, which would have been polite. </seg>
<seg id="374"> In fact, you have been as careful not to look at it as not to mention it. </seg>
<seg id="375"> Yes, I'm sorry. How did you... - I know you saw me. - What? I know you followed last night. </seg>
<seg id="376"> And you must promise not to tell my husband what you saw. Promise me! </seg>
<seg id="377"> The town is in ferment. Horror piled on tragedy. Hardenbrook is dead. </seg>
<seg id="378"> - Oh, no! That harmless old man? - Hanged himself in the night. Hanged himself? </seg>
<seg id="379"> Reverend Steenwyck's called a meeting in the church tonight. </seg>
<seg id="380"> Every man, woman, and child is going to speak out against you. </seg>
<seg id="381"> If you are wise, you will leave this place. </seg>
<seg id="382"> - What is that? - I was careless with the kitchen knife. </seg>
<seg id="383"> The wound looks angry. I will bind it later with wild arrowroot flowers. I know where some grow. </seg>
<seg id="384"> Come on, hurry up. The meeting bell started tolling. </seg>
<seg id="385"> The Horseman! - Katrina! - Father? </seg>
<seg id="386"> The Horseman! Save me! </seg>
<seg id="387"> He killed her. The Horseman killed your stepmother. Oh, God! </seg>
<seg id="388"> Fire! </seg>
<seg id="389"> You'll kill us all! You're the one the Horseman wants. </seg>
<seg id="390"> He cannot enter. Over here! </seg>
<seg id="391"> The Horseman cannot enter. Why should we die for you? </seg>
<seg id="392"> The Horseman cannot enter. He cannot cross the gate. We have to save ourselves. </seg>
<seg id="393"> The next person that lays a hand on me will get a bullet! </seg>
<seg id="394"> He's coming back! </seg>
<seg id="395"> Enough have died already. It's time to confess our sins. </seg>
<seg id="396"> - What is it that you know? - Your four friends played you false. </seg>
<seg id="397"> We were devilishly possessed by one who... </seg>
<seg id="398"> Get out of my way! Stand back! Stay back! </seg>
<seg id="399"> Back! Stand back! </seg>
<seg id="400"> There is a conspiracy here, and I will shake it out. </seg>
<seg id="401"> It was an evil spirit possessed you. </seg>
<seg id="402"> I pray God it is satisfied now, and that you find peace. </seg>
<seg id="403"> The evil eye's done its work. My life is over, spared for a lifetime of horrors in my sleep, waking each day to grief. </seg>
<seg id="404"> Goodbye, Katrina. </seg>
<seg id="405"> - You think it was Katrina, don't you? - That can never be uttered. </seg>
<seg id="406"> A strange sort of witch, with a kind and loving heart. </seg>
<seg id="407"> - How can you think so? - I have good reason. </seg>
<seg id="408"> - Then you are bewitched by reason. - I am beaten down by it! </seg>
<seg id="409"> It is a hard lesson for a hard world, and you had better learn it, young Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="410"> Villainy wears many masks. None so dangerous as the mask of virtue. </seg>
<seg id="411"> Farewell. </seg>
<seg id="412"> - Van Ripper, turn the coach. - What? Turn around now! </seg>
<seg id="413"> Pardon my intrusion. </seg>
<seg id="414"> No blood flow, no clotting, no healing. When this cut was made, this woman was already dead. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Dear stepdaughter, you look as if you'd seen a ghost. </seg>
<seg id="416"> Rise up once more, my dark avenger. </seg>
<seg id="417"> One more night of beheading. Rise up with your sword. </seg>
<seg id="418"> A head for a head. </seg>
<seg id="419"> My unholy horseman, rise! </seg>
<seg id="420"> Come now for Katrina! </seg>
<seg id="421"> Awake at last. Did you think it was all a nasty dream? </seg>
<seg id="422"> Father saw the Horseman kill you. </seg>
<seg id="423"> He saw the Horseman come towards me with his sword unsheathed, but it is I who govern the Horseman, my dear. </seg>
<seg id="424"> And Baltus did not stay to watch. </seg>
<seg id="425"> - But there was a body. - The servant girl, Sarah. </seg>
<seg id="426"> And I always thought she was useless. </seg>
<seg id="427"> But it seems she had a purpose after all. </seg>
<seg id="428"> Who are you? - My family name was Archer. - The archer. </seg>
<seg id="429"> I lived with my father and mother and sister in a cottage not far from here. Until one day my father died, and the landlord, who had received many years of loyal service from my parents, evicted us. </seg>
<seg id="430"> No one in this God-fearing town would take us in because my mother was suspected of witchcraft. </seg>
<seg id="431"> But she schooled her daughters well, while we lived as outcasts in the Western Woods. </seg>
<seg id="432"> She died within a year. </seg>
<seg id="433"> My sister and I remained in our refuge, seeing not a soul. </seg>
<seg id="434"> Until one day, whilst gathering firewood, we crossed the path of the Hessian. </seg>
<seg id="435"> I saw his death. </seg>
<seg id="436"> At that moment, I offered my soul to Satan, if he would raise the Hessian from the grave to avenge me. </seg>
<seg id="437"> - Avenge you? - Against Van Garrett. </seg>
<seg id="438"> The landlord who showed us no mercy and left us to starve, whilst Baltus Van Tassel and his simpering wife and girl child stole our home. </seg>
<seg id="439"> I swore I would make myself mistress of all he had. </seg>
<seg id="440"> The easiest part was the first. To enter your house as your mother's sick nurse, and put her body into the grave and my own into the marriage bed. </seg>
<seg id="441"> Not quite so easy was to secure my legacy. </seg>
<seg id="442"> The Widow had to go, of course. </seg>
<seg id="443"> And the servant, Masbath. And then, just the other day, that silly midwife Killian told me the Widow had told her a big secret. </seg>
<seg id="444"> And she told me this right in front of her husband. What a goose! </seg>
<seg id="445"> So, another little job for the Horseman. </seg>
<seg id="446"> But lust delivered the Reverend Steenwyck into my power. </seg>
<seg id="447"> Fear did the same for the notary, Hardenbrook, and the drunkard Philipse. </seg>
<seg id="448"> And the doctor's silence I exchanged for my complicity in his fornications with the servant girl, Sarah. </seg>
<seg id="449"> - Yes, you have everything now. - No. </seg>
<seg id="450"> You have, my dear, by your father's will. I get everything in the event of your death. </seg>
<seg id="451"> My sister, by the way, sadly passed away. </seg>
<seg id="452"> Quite recently. </seg>
<seg id="453"> You killed your own sister? She brought it on herself by helping you and your master. </seg>
<seg id="454"> You're just in time to have your head cut off. </seg>
<seg id="455"> The Horseman comes! And tonight, he comes for you! </seg>
<seg id="456"> Katrina! Thank God. </seg>
<seg id="457"> Watch your head. </seg>
<seg id="458"> To the roof! I have an idea. </seg>
<seg id="459"> Jump for the sails. </seg>
<seg id="460"> Jump! </seg>
<seg id="461"> Hurry! </seg>
<seg id="462"> - Is he dead? - That's the problem. He was dead to begin with. </seg>
<seg id="463"> - Where are we going? - Anywhere but here. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Here, take the reins. </seg>
<seg id="465"> Ichabod! </seg>
<seg id="466"> My bag! </seg>
<seg id="467"> Jump! </seg>
<seg id="468"> - Still alive? - Run, Katrina. </seg>
<seg id="469"> Yes, do run, and jump, and skip. </seg>
<seg id="470"> No! Here! Take her! She's yours! </seg>
<seg id="471"> Sir, you're not dead. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Horseman! </seg>
<seg id="473"> Just in time for a new century. </seg>
<seg id="474"> You'll soon get your bearings, young Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="475"> The Bronx is up, the Battery's down, and home is this way. </seg>

<doc docid="hotel" genre="subtitles" origlang="en" sysid="sys">
<seg id="1"> It is an extremely common mistake, people think the writer's imagination is always at work, that he's constantly inventing an endless supply of incidents and episodes, that he simply dreams up his stories out of thin air. </seg>
<seg id="2"> In point of fact, the opposite is true. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Once the public knows you're a writer, they bring the characters and events to you and as long as you maintain your ability to look and to carefully listen, these stories will continue to... </seg>
<seg id="4"> Stop it. Stop it! Don't! Don't do it! </seg>
<seg id="5"> Uh, will continue to seek you out over your lifetime. </seg>
<seg id="6"> To him who has often told the tales of others, many tales will be told. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Sorry. It's all right. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The incidents that follow were described to me exactly as I present them here and in a wholly unexpected way. </seg>
<seg id="9"> A number of years ago, while suffering from a mild case of "Scribe's Fever," a form of neurasthenia common among the intelligentsia of that time, I decided to spend the month of August in the spa town of Nebelsbad below the Alpine Sudetenwaltz, and had taken up rooms in the Grand Budapest, a picturesque, elaborate, and once widely celebrated establishment. </seg>
<seg id="10"> I expect some of you will know it. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It was off season and, by that time, decidedly out of fashion, and it had already begun its descent into shabbiness and eventual demolition. </seg>
<seg id="12"> What few guests we were had quickly come to recognize one another by sight as the only living souls residing in the vast establishment, although I do not believe any acquaintance among our number had proceeded beyond the polite nods we exchanged as we passed in the Palm Court, in the Arabian baths, and on board the Colonnade Funicular. </seg>
<seg id="13"> We were a very reserved group, it seemed, and, without exception, solitary. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Perhaps as a result of this general silence, I had established a casual and bantering familiarity with the hotel's concierge, a West-continental known only as Monsieur Jean, who struck one as being, at once, both lazy and, really, quite accommodating. </seg>
<seg id="15"> I expect he was not well paid. </seg>
<seg id="16"> In any case, one evening, as I stood conferring elbow-to-elbow with Monsieur Jean, as had become my habit, I noticed a new presence in our company. A small, elderly man, smartly dressed, with an exceptionally lively, intelligent face and an immediately perceptible air of sadness. </seg>
<seg id="17"> He was, like the rest of us, alone, but also, I must say, he was the first that struck one as being deeply and truly lonely. </seg>
<seg id="18"> A symptom of my own medical condition as well. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Who's this interesting old fellow? I inquired of Monsieur Jean. </seg>
<seg id="20"> To my surprise, he was distinctly taken aback. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Don't you know? He asked. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Don't you recognize him? </seg>
<seg id="23"> He did look familiar. </seg>
<seg id="24"> That's Mr. Moustafa himself. </seg>
<seg id="25"> He arrived earlier this morning. </seg>
<seg id="26"> This name will no doubt be familiar to the more seasoned persons among you. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Mr. Zero Moustafa was at one time the richest man in Zubrowka, and was still indeed the owner of the Grand Budapest. </seg>
<seg id="28"> He often comes and stays a week or more, three times a year at least, but never in the season. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Monsieur Jean signaled to me and I leaned closer. </seg>
<seg id="30"> I'll tell you a secret. </seg>
<seg id="31"> He takes only a single-bed sleeping room without a bath in the rear corner of the top floor and it's smaller than the service elevator! </seg>
<seg id="32"> It was well known, Zero Moustafa had purchased and famously inhabited some of the most lavish castles and palazzos on the continent. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Yet here, in his own nearly empty hotel, he occupied a servant's quarters? </seg>
<seg id="34"> At that moment, the curtain rose on a parenthetical, domestic drama... Shit. </seg>
<seg id="35"> ...which required the immediate and complete attention of Monsieur Jean, but, frankly, did not hold mine for long. </seg>
<seg id="36"> However, this premature intermission in the story of the curious, old man had left me, as the expression goes, "gespannt wie ein Flitzebogen," that is, on the edge of my seat, where I remained throughout the next morning, until, in what I have found to be its mysterious and utterly reliable fashion, fate, once again, intervened on my behalf. </seg>
<seg id="37"> I admire your work. </seg>
<seg id="38"> I beg your pardon? </seg>
<seg id="39"> I said, I know and admire your wonderful work. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Thank you most kindly, sir. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Did Monsieur Jean have a word or two to share with you about the aged proprietor of this establishment? I must confess, I did myself inquire about you. He's perfectly capable, of course, Monsieur Jean but we can't claim he's a first, or, in earnest, even second-rate concierge. </seg>
<seg id="42"> But there it is. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Times have changed. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The thermal baths are very beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="45"> They were in their first condition. </seg>
<seg id="46"> It couldn't be maintained, of course. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Too decadent for current tastes. </seg>
<seg id="48"> But I love it all just the same, this enchanting old ruin. </seg>
<seg id="49"> How did you come to buy it, if I may ask? </seg>
<seg id="50"> The Grand Budapest. </seg>
<seg id="51"> I didn't. </seg>
<seg id="52"> If you're not merely being polite, and you must tell me if that's the case, but if it genuinely does interest you, may I invite you to dine with me tonight, and it will be my pleasure and, indeed, my privilege to tell you "my story." Such as it is. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Two ducks roasted with olives. </seg>
<seg id="54"> Rabbit, salad? </seg>
<seg id="55"> Pouilly-Jouvet '52, plus a split of the brut. </seg>
<seg id="56"> That should provide us ample time if I commence promptly. </seg>
<seg id="57"> By all means. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Well, it begins, as it must, with our mutual friend's predecessor. </seg>
<seg id="59"> The beloved, original concierge of The Grand Budapest. </seg>
<seg id="60"> It begins, of course, with... </seg>
<seg id="61"> - Bring the table to the window. - Yes, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="62"> - Bring the tray to the table. - Right away, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="63"> Right there. Have those been brushed and blocked? </seg>
<seg id="64"> Of course, Monsieur Gustave. Pack them in the hat boxes. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Is that from Oberstdorf & Company? </seg>
<seg id="66"> I believe so, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="67"> Second trunk. Who has the tickets? I do, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Give them to me. </seg>
<seg id="69"> These are in order. Wait in the corner. </seg>
<seg id="70"> - I'm not leaving. </seg>
<seg id="71"> - I beg your pardon? </seg>
<seg id="72"> - I'm not leaving. - Why not? </seg>
<seg id="73"> - I'm frightened. - Of what? </seg>
<seg id="74"> I fear this may be the last time we ever see each other. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Why on earth would that be the case? </seg>
<seg id="76"> Well, I can't put it into words, but I feel it. </seg>
<seg id="77"> For goodness sake, there's no reason for you to leave us if you'd... </seg>
<seg id="78"> - Come with me. - To fucking Lutz? </seg>
<seg id="79"> - Please. - Give me your hand. </seg>
<seg id="80"> You've nothing to fear. You're always anxious before you travel. </seg>
<seg id="81"> I admit, you appear to be suffering a more acute attack on this occasion. </seg>
<seg id="82"> But, truly and honestly... Oh, dear God. </seg>
<seg id="83"> What have you done to your fingernails? </seg>
<seg id="84"> - I beg your pardon? - This diabolical varnish. </seg>
<seg id="85"> - The color is completely wrong. - Don't you like it? </seg>
<seg id="86"> It's not that I don't like it. I am physically repulsed. </seg>
<seg id="87"> - Perhaps this will soothe you. - What? Don't recite. </seg>
<seg id="88"> Just listen to the words. Hush. Please. Not now. </seg>
<seg id="89"> "While questing once in noble wood of gray, medieval pine, I came upon a tomb, rain-slick'd, rubbed-cool, ethereal, 'its inscription long-vanished, yet still within its melancholy fissures..." </seg>
<seg id="90"> Will you light a candle for me, please? </seg>
<seg id="91"> - In the sacristy of Santa Maria? </seg>
<seg id="92"> - I'll see to it myself immediately. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Remember, I'm always with you. </seg>
<seg id="94"> I love you. </seg>
<seg id="95"> I love you. </seg>
<seg id="96"> It's quite a thing winning the loyalty of a woman like that for 19 consecutive seasons. </seg>
<seg id="97"> Um... Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="98"> She's very fond of me, you know. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="100"> But I've never seen her like that before. </seg>
<seg id="101"> No, sir. </seg>
<seg id="102"> She was shaking like a shitting dog. </seg>
<seg id="103"> Truly. </seg>
<seg id="104"> Run to the cathedral of Santa Maria in Brucknerplatz. </seg>
<seg id="105"> Buy one of the plain, half-length candles and take back four Klubecks in change. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Light it in the sacristy, say a brief rosary then go to Mendl's and get me a courtesan au chocolat. </seg>
<seg id="107"> If there's any money left, give it to the crippled shoe-shine boy. </seg>
<seg id="108"> - Right away, sir. - Hold it. </seg>
<seg id="109"> - Who are you? </seg>
<seg id="110"> - I'm Zero, sir. The new Lobby Boy. </seg>
<seg id="111"> - Zero, you say? - Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="112"> - I've never heard of you, never laid eyes on you. - Who hired you? </seg>
<seg id="113"> - Mr. Mosher, sir. - Mr. Mosher! </seg>
<seg id="114"> Yes, Monsieur Gustave? </seg>
<seg id="115"> Am I to understand you've surreptitiously hired this young man in the position of a Lobby Boy? </seg>
<seg id="116"> He's been engaged for a trial period, pending your approval. </seg>
<seg id="117"> Perhaps, yes. Thank you, Mr. Mosher. </seg>
<seg id="118"> You're most welcome, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="119"> You're now going to be officially interviewed. Should I go and light the candle first, sir? </seg>
<seg id="120"> What? No. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Experience? </seg>
<seg id="122"> Hotel Kinski, Kitchen Boy, six months. </seg>
<seg id="123"> Hotel Berlitz, Mop and Broom Boy, three months. </seg>
<seg id="124"> - Before that I was a Skillet Scrubber... - Experience, zero. </seg>
<seg id="125"> - Thank you again, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="126"> - Straighten that cap, Anatole. </seg>
<seg id="127"> - The pleasure's mine, Herr Schneider. - The strap's busted. </seg>
<seg id="128"> - These are not acceptable. - I fully agree. </seg>
<seg id="129"> - Education? - I studied reading and spelling. </seg>
<seg id="130"> I started my primary school. I almost... </seg>
<seg id="131"> - Education, zero. - Now it's exploded. </seg>
<seg id="132"> Good morning, Cicero. Call the goddamn plumber! </seg>
<seg id="133"> This afternoon, Monsieur Gustave? </seg>
<seg id="134"> - Without fail, Frau Liebling. </seg>
<seg id="135"> - What in hell is this? Not now. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Family? </seg>
<seg id="137"> Zero. </seg>
<seg id="138"> Six, Igor. </seg>
<seg id="139"> Why do you want to be a Lobby Boy? </seg>
<seg id="140"> Well, who wouldn't, at the Grand Budapest, sir? </seg>
<seg id="141"> It's an institution. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Very good. </seg>
<seg id="143"> - A thousand Klubecks. - My goodness. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Were you ever a Lobby Boy, sir? </seg>
<seg id="145"> What do you think? </seg>
<seg id="146"> Well, I suppose you'd have to start somewhere... </seg>
<seg id="147"> Go and light the goddamn candle. Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="148"> And so, my life began. </seg>
<seg id="149"> Junior Lobby Boy in-training, Grand Budapest Hotel, under the strict command of Monsieur Gustave H. </seg>
<seg id="150"> I became his pupil, and he was to be my counselor and guardian. GUSTAVE H: What is a Lobby Boy? </seg>
<seg id="151"> A Lobby Boy's completely invisible, yet always in sight. A Lobby Boy remembers what people hate. A Lobby Boy anticipates the client's needs before the needs are needed. </seg>
<seg id="152"> A Lobby Boy is, above all, discreet to a fault. Our guests know their deepest secrets, some of which are, frankly, rather unseemly, will go with us to our graves. So keep your mouth shut, Zero. - Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="153"> That's all for now. </seg>
<seg id="154"> I began to realize that many of the hotel's most valued and distinguished guests came for him. It seemed to be an essential part of his duties. </seg>
<seg id="155"> Ah! ...but I believe it was also his pleasure. The requirements were always the same. </seg>
<seg id="156"> They had to be rich, old, insecure, vain, superficial, blonde, needy. Why blonde? </seg>
<seg id="157"> Because they all were. He was, by the way, the most liberally perfumed man I had ever encountered. The scent announced his approach from a great distance and lingered for many minutes after he was gone. I worked six days each week plus a half-day Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="158"> Our meals were small but frequent, for stamina. Two breakfasts, two lunches and a late supper. Monsieur Gustave also delivered a nightly sermon. Rudeness is merely the expression of fear. </seg>
<seg id="159"> People fear they won't get what they want. The most dreadful and unattractive person only needs to be loved, and they will open up like a flower. </seg>
<seg id="160"> I am reminded of a verse, "The painter's brush touched the inchoate face by ends of nimble bristles "and with their blush of first color, "rendered her lifeless cheek living." </seg>
<seg id="161"> MR. MOUSTAFA: His own dinner, he took alone in his room. </seg>
<seg id="162"> The identity of the owner of the hotel was unknown to all of us. </seg>
<seg id="163"> Each month, his emissary, known as Deputy Kovacs, arrived to review the books and convey messages on behalf of the mysterious proprietor. </seg>
<seg id="164"> On these occasions, Monsieur Gustave and our business manager, Herr Becker, met with him in private consultation above Reception. </seg>
<seg id="165"> This was also when I met Agatha, but we won't discuss that. What do you want? Look. </seg>
<seg id="166"> Dear God. </seg>
<seg id="167"> I'm terribly sorry, sir. </seg>
<seg id="168"> We must go to her. - We must? </seg>
<seg id="169"> Tout de suite. She needs me, and I need you to help me with my bags and so on. </seg>
<seg id="170"> - How fast can you pack? - Five minutes. </seg>
<seg id="171"> Do it. And bring a bottle of the Pouilly-Jouvet '26 in an ice bucket with two glasses so we don't have to drink the cat piss they serve in the dining car. </seg>
<seg id="172"> I blame myself. She tried to tell me she had a premonition. I didn't listen. All of Lutz will be dressed in black, except her own ghastly, deceitful children whom she loathed and couldn't bear to kiss hello. They'll be dancing like gypsies. </seg>
<seg id="173"> There's really no point in doing anything in life, because it's all over in the blink of an eye... </seg>
<seg id="174"> And, the next thing you know, rigor mortis sets in. Oh, how the good die young. </seg>
<seg id="175"> With any luck, she's left a few Klubecks for your old friend, but one never knows until the ink is dry on the death certificate. </seg>
<seg id="176"> She was dynamite in the sack, by the way. </seg>
<seg id="177"> She was 84, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="178"> I've had older. </seg>
<seg id="179"> When you're young, it's all fillet steak, but as the years go by, you have to move on to the cheaper cuts, which is fine with me, because I like those. More flavorful, or so they say. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Why are we stopping at a barley field? </seg>
<seg id="181"> Well, hello there, chaps. Documents, please. With pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="182"> It's not a very flattering portrait, I'm afraid. I was once considered a great beauty. </seg>
<seg id="183"> What does the "F" stand for? Fritz? Franz? </seg>
<seg id="184"> - Franz. - I knew it! </seg>
<seg id="185"> He's making a funny face. </seg>
<seg id="186"> That's a Migratory Visa with Stage Three Worker Status, Franz, darling. </seg>
<seg id="187"> He's with me. </seg>
<seg id="188"> Come outside, please. </seg>
<seg id="189"> Now, wait a minute. Sit down, Zero. His papers are in order. </seg>
<seg id="190"> I cross-referenced them myself with the Bureau of Labor and Servitude. </seg>
<seg id="191"> You can't arrest him simply because he's a bloody immigrant. </seg>
<seg id="192"> He hasn't done anything wrong. </seg>
<seg id="193"> Stop it, damn you! </seg>
<seg id="194"> Never mind, Monsieur Gustave! Let them proceed! </seg>
<seg id="195"> Ow! That hurts! </seg>
<seg id="196"> You filthy, goddamn, pock-marked, fascist assholes! </seg>
<seg id="197"> Take your hands off my Lobby Boy! </seg>
<seg id="198"> What's the problem? </seg>
<seg id="199"> This is outrageous. </seg>
<seg id="200"> The young man works for me at the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad. </seg>
<seg id="201"> Monsieur Gustave? </seg>
<seg id="202"> My name is Henckels. </seg>
<seg id="203"> I'm the son of Dr. and Mrs. Wolfgang Henckels-Bergersdörfer. Do you remember me? I know exactly who you are. It's uncanny. You're little Albert. I'm terribly embarrassed. Release them. Release them. </seg>
<seg id="204"> Your colleague is stateless. He'll need to apply for a revised Special Transit Permit, which at this point may be very difficult to acquire. Take this. </seg>
<seg id="205"> It's temporary but it's the best I can offer, I'm afraid. And how's your wonderful mother? - She's very well, thank you. - I adore her. - Send my love. - I will. </seg>
<seg id="206"> Your companion was very kind to me when I was a lonely little boy. </seg>
<seg id="207"> My men and I apologize for disturbing you. I beg your pardon, sir. </seg>
<seg id="208"> You see? There are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Indeed, that's what we provide in our own modest, humble, insignificant... </seg>
<seg id="210"> Oh, fuck it. </seg>
<seg id="211"> Where is she, Clotilde? Take me to her. You're looking so well, darling. You really are. They've done a marvelous job. </seg>
<seg id="212"> I don't know what sort of cream they've put on you down at the morgue, but I want some. Honestly, you look better than you have in years. You look like you're alive. </seg>
<seg id="213"> Oh, you changed it after all. It's perfect. - Clotilde? - Oui, Monsieur Gustave? </seg>
<seg id="214"> A glass of chilled water with no ice, please. Oh. All right, then. </seg>
<seg id="215"> I shan't be long, darling. We were escorted through a green baize door, down a narrow service corridor and into the butler's pantry. </seg>
<seg id="216"> A moment later, the kitchen passage swung open and a small servant dressed in white jolted into the room. I've never forgotten the look on that man's face. What the devil is going on? </seg>
<seg id="217"> I, myself, had never set foot inside a house of this kind in my life. </seg>
<seg id="218"> I understood very little about the events that were to follow. </seg>
<seg id="219"> But, eventually, I came to recognize, when the destiny of a great fortune is at stake, men's greed spreads like a poison in the bloodstream. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Uncles, nephews, cousins, in-laws of increasingly tenuous connection. The old woman's most distant relations had come foraging out of the woodwork. </seg>
<seg id="221"> At the head of this congregation, it was a disorienting coincidence, we discovered our own Deputy Kovacs, himself an important attorney, of course. </seg>
<seg id="222"> He was the executor of the dead widow's estate. This is Madame D's last will and testament. </seg>
<seg id="223"> It consists of a general tontine drawn up before the event of her husband's death 46 years ago, in combination with 635 amendments, notations, corrections, and letters of wishes executed during the subsequent decades. </seg>
<seg id="224"> The ultimate legality of this accumulation requires further analysis, but in the opinion of this office, it was Madame D's intention that control of the vast bulk of her estate should be transferred, forthwith, to her son, Dmitri, with special allowances for his sisters, Marguerite, Laetizia, and Carolina, and minor gifts for various members of the extended family as shown in the List of Recipients, which I will elucidate in due course. </seg>
<seg id="225"> However. An additional codicil, delivered into my possession by post only this morning, and, by all indications, sent by Madame D during the last hours of her life, contains an amendment to the original certificate, which, as prescribed by law, I will read to you now. </seg>
<seg id="226"> The authenticity of this document has not yet been confirmed by the presiding magistrate, so I ask that all parties be patient and refrain from comment until such time as our investigations can be completed. </seg>
<seg id="227"> "To my esteemed friend who comforted me in my later years "and brought sunshine into the life of an old woman "who thought that she would never be happy again. </seg>
<seg id="228"> "Monsieur Gustave H, "I bequeath, bestow and devise, free of all taxation "and with full and absolute fiduciary entitlement, "the painting known as 'Boy with Apple... Wow! "...by Johannes van Hoytl..." </seg>
<seg id="229"> I can't believe it. "...the younger..." What? "...which gave us both so much pleasure." </seg>
<seg id="230"> The van Hoytl? - Tax-free? - Can she do that? Who's Gustave H? </seg>
<seg id="231"> I'm afraid that's me, darling. That fucking faggot! He's a concierge. What are you doing here? I've come to pay my respects to a great woman whom I loved. </seg>
<seg id="232"> - This man is an intruder in my home! - It's not yours yet, Dmitri. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Only when probate is granted, and the Deed of Entitlement... </seg>
<seg id="234"> You're not getting Boy with  Apple, you goddamn little fruit! </seg>
<seg id="235"> How's that supposed to make me feel? </seg>
<seg id="236"> Call the police. We're pressing charges. </seg>
<seg id="237"> This criminal has plagued my family for nearly 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="238"> He's a ruthless adventurer and a con-artist who preys on mentally feeble, sick old ladies, and he probably fucks them, too! </seg>
<seg id="239"> I go to bed with all my friends. Where's Céline? </seg>
<seg id="240"> What? She's dead. We're reading her will. </seg>
<seg id="241"> Oh, yes, yes, of course. </seg>
<seg id="242"> If I learn you ever once laid a finger on my mother's body, living or dead, I swear to God, I'll out your throat! You hear me? </seg>
<seg id="243"> I thought I was supposed to be a fucking faggot. - You are, but you're bisexual. - Let's change the subject. I'm leaving. </seg>
<seg id="244"> That picture, Boy with Apple, is priceless. Understand? Congratulations, Monsieur Gustave! </seg>
<seg id="245"> They're going to fight me for the son of a bitch. - Is it very beautiful? - Beyond description. </seg>
<seg id="246"> "E'en the most gifted bard's rhyme can only sing "but to the lack of her and all she isn't! "His tongue doth..." Can I see it? I don't see why not. </seg>
<seg id="247"> This is van Hoytl's exquisite portrayal of a beautiful boy on the cusp of manhood. Blond, smooth. Skin as white as that milk. </seg>
<seg id="248"> Of impeccable provenance. One of the last in private hands, and unquestionably, the best. It's a masterpiece. </seg>
<seg id="249"> The rest of this shit is worthless junk. </seg>
<seg id="250"> What did you want to tell me, before? I think I cannot say right now. </seg>
<seg id="251"> Write me tomorrow. Lutzbahn Station! I'll never part with it. It reminded her of me. It will remind me of her. Always. I'll die with this picture above my bed. See the resemblance? Oh, yes. Actually, we should sell it. </seg>
<seg id="252"> Sooner rather than later, in case they try to steal it back. Plus, something about those lunatic foot-soldiers on the express... </seg>
<seg id="253"> This could be a tricky war and a long dry spell in the hotel trade. For all we know, they could board us up tomorrow. Let's make a solemn blood-pact. </seg>
<seg id="254"> We'll contact the black market and liquidate Boy with Apple by the end of the week, then leave the country and lay low somewhere along the Maltese Riviera until the troubles blow over and we resume our posts. </seg>
<seg id="255"> In exchange for your help, your loyalty and your services as my personal valet, I pledge to you 1.5% of the net sale price. </seg>
<seg id="256"> Could we make it 10? 10? Are you joking? That's more than I'd pay an actual dealer, and you wouldn't know Chiaroscuro from chicken giblets. </seg>
<seg id="257"> No, 1.5 is correct. But I'll tell you what, if I die first, and I most certainly will, you will be my sole heir. There's not much in the kitty except a set of ivory-backed hairbrushes and my library of romantic poetry, but when the time comes, these will be yours, along with whatever we haven't already spent on whores and whiskey. This is our sacred bond. I'll draw it up right now. </seg>
<seg id="258"> I, Monsieur Gustave H, being of relatively sound mind and body, on this day, the 19th of October, in the year of our Lord 1932... </seg>
<seg id="259"> He never told me where he came from. I never asked who his family had been. Excuse me. </seg>
<seg id="260"> The police are here. They asked for you. Tell them I'll be right down. Okay. </seg>
<seg id="261"> Have you ever been questioned by the authorities? Yes, on one occasion I was arrested and tortured by the rebel militia after the Desert Uprising. </seg>
<seg id="262"> You know the drill, then. Zip it. Of course. You've never heard the word "van Hoytl" in your life. Okay, let's go. How may we serve you, gentlemen? Ah, Inspector Henckels. </seg>
<seg id="263"> "By order of the Commissioner of Police, Zubrowka Province, "I hereby place you under arrest for the murder "of Madame Céline Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis." </seg>
<seg id="264"> I knew there was something fishy. We never got the cause of death. She's been murdered and you think I did it. </seg>
<seg id="265"> Hey! </seg>
<seg id="266"> Stop! </seg>
<seg id="267"> What happened? </seg>
<seg id="268"> What happened, my dear Zero, is I beat the living shit out of a sniveling little runt called Pinky Bandinski who had the gall to question my virility, because if there's one thing we've learned from penny dreadfuls, it's that, when you find yourself in a place like this, you must never be a candy-ass. </seg>
<seg id="269"> You've got to prove yourself from Day One. You've got to win their respect. You should take a long look at his ugly mug this morning. He's, actually, become a dear friend. You'll meet him, I hope. </seg>
<seg id="270"> So. You've talked to Kovacs? </seg>
<seg id="271"> I saw him last night in secret. </seg>
<seg id="272"> He made me take an oath on a Bible I wouldn't tell a soul. </seg>
<seg id="273"> - You're supposed to also. - I'll do that later. </seg>
<seg id="274"> - He suspects you're innocent. - Of course he does. </seg>
<seg id="275"> What's the charge? </seg>
<seg id="276"> In the small hours of the evening of 19 October, </seg>
<seg id="277"> an individual well-known to the house and staff, a Monsieur Gustave H, did arrive at the Desgoffe und Taxis residence in Lutz and entered by the rear service alley, alerting no one to his presence, </seg>
<seg id="278"> and did then proceed by way of back stairs and servants' passage, to deliver himself into the private chambers of Madame D. There is no evidence to indicate whether this visit had been pre-arranged with her or not. </seg>
<seg id="279"> The next morning Madame D was found dead by strychnine poisoning. Monsieur Gustave was not observed on the premises again until, of course, 24 hours later. </seg>
<seg id="280"> The identity of his accusers is made clear in this notarized deposition. </seg>
<seg id="281"> They include, essentially, all members of the extended family, but the key witness who actually ostensibly saw the alleged events appears to have fled the jurisdiction. His whereabouts are currently unknown, but he's being sought and pursued by the relevant authorities. </seg>
<seg id="282"> Who is he? </seg>
<seg id="283"> - Serge? - I'm afraid so. </seg>
<seg id="284"> That little prick. </seg>
<seg id="285"> No, I don't believe it. They put him up to it. I've been dropped into a nest of vipers. You have an alibi? </seg>
<seg id="286"> Of course, but she's married to the Duke of Westphalia. </seg>
<seg id="287"> I can't allow her name to get mixed-up in all this monkey business. </seg>
<seg id="288"> - Your life may be at stake. - I know, but the bitch legged it. </seg>
<seg id="289"> She's already on board the Queen Nasstasja halfway to Dutch Tanganyika. Don't give up. </seg>
<seg id="290"> The details of the conspiracy, now a matter of public record, were, at that time, impossible for us to apprehend. I'm looking for Serge X, a young man in the service of my employer, the family Desgoffe und Taxis of Schloss Lutz. </seg>
<seg id="291"> - Yes, sir? - You're his sister? </seg>
<seg id="292"> - Yes, sir. - Seen him lately? </seg>
<seg id="293"> - No, sir. - No, sir? </seg>
<seg id="294"> - No, sir. </seg>
<seg id="295"> I need to find him right away, for his own safety and everybody else's. </seg>
<seg id="296"> If he shows up... </seg>
<seg id="297"> - Yes, sir? - Tell him Jopling says, </seg>
<seg id="298"> "Come home." </seg>
<seg id="299"> But one thing was certain, the Desgoffe und Taxis were a very powerful family, and time was not on our side. </seg>
<seg id="300"> A letter from Monsieur Gustave. Zero. </seg>
<seg id="301"> - You want me to? - Read it. </seg>
<seg id="302"> "My dear and trusted colleagues..." </seg>
<seg id="303"> I miss you deeply as I write from the confines of my regrettable and preposterous incarceration. </seg>
<seg id="304"> Until I walk amongst you again as a free man, the Grand Budapest remains in your hands, as does its impeccable reputation. </seg>
<seg id="305"> Keep it spotless and glorify it. </seg>
<seg id="306"> Take extra special care of every little-bitty bit of it as if I were watching over you like a hawk with a horse whip in its talons, because I am. </seg>
<seg id="307"> Should I discover a lapse of any variety during my absence, I promise, swift and merciless justice will descend upon you. A great and noble house has been placed under your protection. Tell Zero if you see any funny business. </seg>
<seg id="308"> "Your devoted Monsieur Gustave." </seg>
<seg id="309"> Then there's a poem, but we might want to start on the soup since it's 46 stanzas. </seg>
<seg id="310"> "A moist, black ash dampens the filth of a dung-dark rat's nest "and mingles with the thick scent of wood rot "while the lark song of a guttersnipe..." </seg>
<seg id="311"> I never trusted that butler. </seg>
<seg id="312"> - He's too honest. - Too honest, you say? </seg>
<seg id="313"> Mmm-hmm. Right, well, be that as it may, find him quick and make it snappy. </seg>
<seg id="314"> May I offer any of you inmates a plate of mush? </seg>
<seg id="315"> No? Anyone? </seg>
<seg id="316"> You with the very large scar on your face? </seg>
<seg id="317"> Try it. It's actually quite warm and nourishing this morning. It needs a dash of salt. Good day. </seg>
<seg id="318"> Mush, gents? Any takers? Suit yourselves. </seg>
<seg id="319"> Rise and shine. Chop, chop. Good morning, Pinky. </seg>
<seg id="320"> - Mendl's again? - Precisely. </seg>
<seg id="321"> Who's got the throat slitter? - Out of this world. - Mendl's is the best. </seg>
<seg id="322"> - Well, back to work. Monsieur Gustave? Yes? </seg>
<seg id="323"> Me and the boys talked it over. We think you're a really straight fellow. Well, I've never been accused of that before, but I appreciate the sentiment. </seg>
<seg id="324"> You're one of us now. What a lovely thing to say. Thank you, dear Pinky. Thank you, Gunther. Thank you, Wolf. Anything else? Tell him, Ludwig. </seg>
<seg id="325"> Checkpoint 19 ain't no two-bit hoosegow. You got broad-gauge iron bars on every door, vent and window. You got 72 guards on the floor and 16 more in the towers. You got a 325-foot drop into a moat full of crocodiles. But, like the best of them, it's got a soft spot, which in this case happens to take the form of a storm-drain sewer system dating from the time of the original rock fortification way back in the Middle Ages. </seg>
<seg id="326"> Now, nobody's saying it's a stroll down a tree-lined promenade with a fine lady and a white poodle, but it's got what you'd call "vulnerability," and that's our bread and butter. </seg>
<seg id="327"> Take a look. Who drew this? What do you mean, "Who drew this?" I did. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Very good. You've got a wonderful line, Ludwig. This shows great artistic promise. Question, how do you intend to penetrate this lowest rudiment? It's 25 inches of reinforced granite masonry, is it not? Digging with the throat-slitter, I expect this would take three to six months of continual effort, during which time several of our members will have been violently executed. </seg>
<seg id="329"> You hit the nail on the head, Mr. Gustave. We got fake documents, second-hand street clothes, a rope ladder made of sticks and bunk-linens, but we need digging tools, which are proving hard to come by in this flop-house. At this point in the story, the old man fell silent and pushed away his saddle of lamb. </seg>
<seg id="330"> His eyes went blank as two stones. I could see he was in distress. </seg>
<seg id="331"> - Are you ill, Mr. Moustafa? - I finally asked. - Oh, dear me, no. - He said. </seg>
<seg id="332"> It's only that I don't know how to proceed. He was crying. </seg>
<seg id="333"> You see, I never speak of Agatha, because even at the thought of her name I'm unable to control my emotions. Well, I suppose there's no way around it. </seg>
<seg id="334"> You see, she saved us. On our third formal rendezvous, I had asked for her hand in marriage and she had agreed. </seg>
<seg id="335"> - Will you marry me? - Yes. </seg>
<seg id="336"> We did not have 50 Klubecks between the two of us. No one knew, of course, but, then, who would have cared? We were each completely on our own in the world, and we were deeply in love. </seg>
<seg id="337"> - Here. - Thank you. - It's a book. - I see. </seg>
<seg id="338"> Romantic Poetry, Volume One. Monsieur Gustave recommended it. I have a copy of my own as well. - I ruined the surprise, I suppose. - I'll go ahead and open it, anyway. Read the inscription. </seg>
<seg id="339"> Monsieur Gustave insisted on an immediate and thorough cross-examination. </seg>
<seg id="340"> She's charming. She's so charming. ...during which he presented Agatha with a porcelain pendant and five dozen individually tissue-wrapped white tulips in a box the size of a child's coffin. </seg>
<seg id="341"> - It's not right. - I beg your pardon? </seg>
<seg id="342"> Why is he sulking? She's my girlfriend. You can't just buy her things. I'm only interviewing this vision of loveliness on your behalf. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Never be jealous in this life, Zero, not even for an instant. Is he flirting with you? </seg>
<seg id="344"> - Yes. - I approve of this union. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Agatha, my beauty, return to your beloved. Soon we learned... </seg>
<seg id="346"> Blessings upon you both. ...not only was Agatha immensely skilled with a palette knife and a butter-cream flourish... </seg>
<seg id="347"> - Mendl. - Go. </seg>
<seg id="348"> ...she was also very brave. </seg>
<seg id="349"> I believe she was born that way. Something's missing. A crucial document, either misplaced or, conceivably, destroyed. I don't know what it contains, I don't know what it represents, I don't know what it is, but there are traces and shadows of it everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="350"> Now, I don't want to alarm you, and I don't expect to see any significant change in the magistrate's ultimate decision vis-à-vis your own inheritance, but, especially given the circumstances of the death, as well as the disappearance of the key witness in the murder case, Serge X, I suggest that we immediately bring this matter to the attention of the municipal inspector so that there can be absolutely no question of impropriety at any future date. </seg>
<seg id="351"> - Agreed?-  Not agreed. - Not agreed? - Not agreed. - Can I ask you a question, Vilmos? - Yes, Dmitri? - Who are you working for? - I beg your pardon? Who are you working for? I thought you're supposed to be our lawyer. Well, in point of fact, I'm the executor of the estate. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In this particular situation, I represent the deceased. Oh, yeah? Yeah. A provision for my fees was included in the... Just wrap it up and don't make waves. Agreed? </seg>
<seg id="353"> I'm an attorney. I'm obligated to proceed according to the rule of law. Not agreed. This stinks, sisters. Did he just throw my cat out the window? I don't think so. No. - Did he? - Jopling? Okay. </seg>
<seg id="354"> There's something I haven't told you, Agatha. Okay. We stole a painting. It's very valuable, maybe five million Klubecks, in fact. I don't know if anyone's even noticed it's missing yet, but if something should happen to me... You steal art? </seg>
<seg id="355"> One picture. Anyway, we need to make a plan for your survival. Hide this. It's in code and you might need a magnifying glass to read it, but it tells you exactly where and how to find Boy with Apple. Don't take less than half the retail asking price. Also... </seg>
<seg id="356"> - Zero, I'm a baker. - You're a pastry chef. I'm not a fence, if that's the term. I don't trade in stolen property. I said it wrong. She willed it to him. Go to sleep. Yes, Herr Mendl. </seg>
<seg id="357"> - Hide this. - No. </seg>
<seg id="358"> Okay, but take it anyway. The next morning, Herr Becker received a peculiar, last-minute notice from the office of Deputy Kovacs, postponing their scheduled meeting, in perpetuity. </seg>
<seg id="359"> Let's blow. </seg>
<seg id="360"> - How did you get out there? - Shut the fuck up. </seg>
<seg id="361"> These guys are trying to escape. </seg>
<seg id="362"> What's wrong with you, you goddamn snitch? </seg>
<seg id="363"> Guard! Guard! </seg>
<seg id="364"> It's you. Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Thank you, you sweet, kind man. </seg>
<seg id="366"> Okay. </seg>
<seg id="367"> I suppose you'd call that a draw. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Good evening. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Let me introduce you. Pinky, Wolf, Ludwig, this is the divine Zero. </seg>
<seg id="370"> Gunther was slain in the catacombs. </seg>
<seg id="371"> Well, boys, who knows when we'll all meet again, but if one day... </seg>
<seg id="372"> Hold it. </seg>
<seg id="373"> No time to gab. </seg>
<seg id="374"> Take care of yourself, Mr. Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="375"> Good luck, kid. </seg>
<seg id="376"> - Which way to the safe house? - I couldn't find one. </seg>
<seg id="377"> No safe house? Really? We're completely on our own out here? </seg>
<seg id="378"> I'm afraid so. I asked around, but... </seg>
<seg id="379"> I understand. Too risky. We'll just have to wing it, I suppose. </seg>
<seg id="380"> Let's put on our disguises. </seg>
<seg id="381"> - We're wearing them. - No, we're not. </seg>
<seg id="382"> We said false whiskers and fake noses and so on. </seg>
<seg id="383"> - You didn't bring any? - I thought you were growing one. </seg>
<seg id="384"> And it wouldn't look realistic, would it? </seg>
<seg id="385"> No, when done properly, they're perfectly convincing. </seg>
<seg id="386"> But I take your point. So be it. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Give me a few squirts of L'air de Panache, please, will you? </seg>
<seg id="388"> - Can I not get a squirt, even? - I forgot the L'air de Panache. </seg>
<seg id="389"> Honestly, you forgot the L'air de Panache? </seg>
<seg id="390"> I don't believe it. How could you? </seg>
<seg id="391"> I've been in jail, Zero! Do you understand how humiliating this is? </seg>
<seg id="392"> I smell. </seg>
<seg id="393"> That's just marvelous, isn't it? </seg>
<seg id="394"> I suppose this is to be expected back in... Where do you come from again? </seg>
<seg id="395"> - Aq Salim al-Jabat. - Precisely. </seg>
<seg id="396"> I suppose this is to be expected back in Aq Salim al-Jabat where one's prized possessions are a stack of filthy carpets and a starving goat, and one sleeps behind a tent flap and survives on wild dates and scarabs. </seg>
<seg id="397"> But it's not how I trained you. </seg>
<seg id="398"> What on God's earth possessed you to leave the homeland where you obviously belong and travel unspeakable distances to become a penniless immigrant in a refined, highly-cultivated society that, quite frankly, could've gotten along very well without you? </seg>
<seg id="399"> The war. </seg>
<seg id="400"> Say again? </seg>
<seg id="401"> Well, you see, my father was murdered and the rest of my family were executed by firing squad. Our village was burned to the ground and those who managed to survive were forced to flee. </seg>
<seg id="402"> I left because of the war. </seg>
<seg id="403"> I see. So you're, actually, really more of a refugee, in that sense? </seg>
<seg id="404"> Truly. </seg>
<seg id="405"> Well, I suppose I'd better take back everything I just said. What a bloody idiot I am. Pathetic fool. </seg>
<seg id="406"> Goddamn, selfish bastard. </seg>
<seg id="407"> This is disgraceful, and it's beneath the standards of the Grand Budapest. I apologize on behalf of the hotel. </seg>
<seg id="408"> It's not your fault. You were just upset I forgot the perfume. Don't make excuses for me. I owe you my life. </seg>
<seg id="409"> You are my dear friend and protégé and I'm very proud of you. </seg>
<seg id="410"> You must know that. </seg>
<seg id="411"> I'm so sorry, Zero. </seg>
<seg id="412"> We're brothers. </seg>
<seg id="413"> How's our darling Agatha? </seg>
<seg id="414"> "'Twas first light when I saw her face upon the heath, "and hence did I return, day-by-day, entranced, "tho' vinegar did brine my heart, never..." </seg>
<seg id="415"> Very good. I'm going to stop you there because the alarm has sounded, but remember where we left off because I insist you finish later. </seg>
<seg id="416"> I want roadblocks at every junction for 50km. </seg>
<seg id="417"> I want rail blocks at every train station for 100km. </seg>
<seg id="418"> I want 50 men and 10 bloodhounds ready in five minutes. We're going to strip-search every pretzel-Ha us, Waffel-hut, Biergarten and especially every grand hotel from Äugenzburg to Zilchbrück. </seg>
<seg id="419"> These men are dangerous, professional criminals. At least three of them are anyway. </seg>
<seg id="420"> Who are you? </seg>
<seg id="421"> What are you doing here? Civilian personnel aren't permitted in the cellblock. - This is a military investigation. - This is Mr. Jopling, sir. His employer's mother was one of the victims... </seg>
<seg id="422"> Shut up. </seg>
<seg id="423"> You work for the family Desgoffe und Taxis? </seg>
<seg id="424"> Are you aware of the murder of Deputy Vilmos Kovacs on 23rd October? </seg>
<seg id="425"> I'm aware of his disappearance. </seg>
<seg id="426"> His body was found stuffed in a sarcophagus behind a storage room at the Kunstmuseum late last night. </seg>
<seg id="427"> He was short four fingers. </seg>
<seg id="428"> - What do you know about that? - Nothing. </seg>
<seg id="429"> Escort Mr. Jopling off the premises. </seg>
<seg id="430"> Mendl's. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Operator, get me the Excelsior Palace in Baden-Jurgen and reverse the charges, please. </seg>
<seg id="432"> We've no choice. There's nowhere else to turn. </seg>
<seg id="433"> I'll hold. Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="434"> It's our only hope. Otherwise, I shouldn't even mention its existence to you. </seg>
<seg id="435"> It goes without saying, never breathe a word about this to a living soul. </seg>
<seg id="436"> - Do you swear? Of course. - What is it, in fact? </seg>
<seg id="437"> I can't say. </seg>
<seg id="438"> How does one come by front-row aisle seats for a first night at the Opera Toscana with one day's notice? </seg>
<seg id="439"> How does one arrange a private viewing of the tapestry collection at the Royal Saxon Gallery? </seg>
<seg id="440"> How does one secure a corner table at Chez Dominique on a Thursday? </seg>
<seg id="441"> Ivan, darling, it's Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="442"> Well, I was until about five minutes ago. </seg>
<seg id="443"> We've taken it upon ourselves to clear out in a hurry if you see what I mean. </seg>
<seg id="444"> Well, through a sewer, as it happens. Exactly. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Listen, Ivan, I'm sorry to out you off, but we're in a bit of a bind. </seg>
<seg id="446"> This is an official request. </seg>
<seg id="447"> I'm formally calling upon the special services of... </seg>
<seg id="448"> IVAN: I'll call you back, Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="449"> Right. Stand by. </seg>
<seg id="450"> I beg your pardon. Do you prefer to walk? </seg>
<seg id="451"> We're right here. It's very simple. </seg>
<seg id="452"> Straight down the corniche, then left. </seg>
<seg id="453"> Jojo, see the gentleman out. </seg>
<seg id="454"> Get me Monsieur Georges at the Château Luxe, please. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Higher, goddammit, higher! </seg>
<seg id="456"> Take over. </seg>
<seg id="457"> - Monsieur Georges. - Higher. </seg>
<seg id="458"> I see. Straightaway. </seg>
<seg id="459"> Get me Monsieur Robin at I'Hôtel Côte du Cap, please. ...and two and three. </seg>
<seg id="460"> Monsieur Robin. There's a call from Monsieur Dino for you. </seg>
<seg id="461"> Take over. </seg>
<seg id="462"> - One, two, three. - Yes, Dino. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Yes, Dino. Okay, Dino. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Get me Monsieur Martin at the Ritz Imperial, please. </seg>
<seg id="465"> Too much salt. </seg>
<seg id="466"> Not enough pepper. </seg>
<seg id="467"> Take over. </seg>
<seg id="468"> - Robin? Martin. Too much salt. </seg>
<seg id="469"> So I've heard. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Maybe. Let me make a few calls. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Serge X, missing. Deputy Kovacs, also missing. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Madame D, dead. Boy with  Apple, stolen, by us. </seg>
<seg id="473"> Dmitri and Jopling, ruthless, cold-blooded savages. </seg>
<seg id="474"> Gustave H, at large. What else? </seg>
<seg id="475"> - Zero, confused. - Zero, confused, indeed. </seg>
<seg id="476"> The plot "thickens," as they say. </seg>
<seg id="477"> Why, by the way? Is it a soup metaphor? </seg>
<seg id="478"> I don't know. </seg>
<seg id="479"> Get in. </seg>
<seg id="480"> We found the butler. </seg>
<seg id="481"> He's hiding out in the remote foothills near Gabelmeister's Peak. </seg>
<seg id="482"> Our contact convinced him to meet you midday tomorrow. </seg>
<seg id="483"> at the observatory on the summit. </seg>
<seg id="484"> Tell no one. He'll explain everything. </seg>
<seg id="485"> Your train departs in four and a half minutes. </seg>
<seg id="486"> Here's your tickets. </seg>
<seg id="487"> - Third class? - It was overbooked. </seg>
<seg id="488"> but the conductor used to be a sommelier at the old Versailles. </seg>
<seg id="489"> He pulled some strings. </seg>
<seg id="490"> You'll need these for the dining car. </seg>
<seg id="491"> One last thing. </seg>
<seg id="492"> L'air de Panache. </seg>
<seg id="493"> They only had the half-ounce. </seg>
<seg id="494"> We should give him something as a symbolic gesture. </seg>
<seg id="495"> - How much money you got? - 42 Klubecks and 3 postage stamps. </seg>
<seg id="496"> Give me 25. Yes. </seg>
<seg id="497"> - Bless you. - Please. </seg>
<seg id="498"> - I've got to hand it to him. - Jesus Christ. </seg>
<seg id="499"> I didn't see that coming. Well, what do you want next? </seg>
<seg id="500"> Talk to the club-footed sister again, and, this time, be persuasive. </seg>
<seg id="501"> Goddamn son of a bitch. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Holy fuck! </seg>
<seg id="503"> What's the meaning of this shit? </seg>
<seg id="504"> Boy with Apple? I thought you'd hidden it. </seg>
<seg id="505"> Why are you only noticing now? I assumed it went to the tax appraiser. </seg>
<seg id="506"> Are you fucking kidding me? </seg>
<seg id="507"> I believe it was removed by Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="508"> I'm not angry with Serge. </seg>
<seg id="509"> You can't blame someone for their basic lack of moral fiber. </seg>
<seg id="510"> He's a frightened, little, yellow-bellied coward. </seg>
<seg id="511"> It's not his fault, is it? I don't know. It depends. </seg>
<seg id="512"> Well, you can say that about most anything. </seg>
<seg id="513"> "It depends." Of course it depends. </seg>
<seg id="514"> Of course it depends. Of course it depends. </seg>
<seg id="515"> Yes, I suppose you're right. Of course it depends. </seg>
<seg id="516"> That doesn't mean I'm not going to throttle the little swamp rat. </seg>
<seg id="517"> May I officiate, by the way? The ceremony? </seg>
<seg id="518"> With pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="519"> I must say, I find that girl utterly delightful. </seg>
<seg id="520"> Flat as a board, enormous birthmark the shape of Mexico over half her face, sweating for hours on end in that sweltering kitchen while Mendl, genius though he is, looms over her like a hulking gorilla. Yet without question, without fail, always and invariably, she's exceedingly lovely. </seg>
<seg id="521"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="522"> Because of her purity. </seg>
<seg id="523"> She admires you as well, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="524"> - Does she? - Very much. </seg>
<seg id="525"> That's a good sign, you know. It means she "gets it." </seg>
<seg id="526"> That's important. </seg>
<seg id="527"> Don't flirt with her. A radio telegram was delivered and signed for by the girl at 4:00 AM. The envelope was found near the body, but its contents were missing. </seg>
<seg id="528"> However, the telegraph office always keeps a carbon of the ticker tape for 24 hours. I copied it down. It reads as follows, "Pack your things stop. </seg>
<seg id="529"> "Be ready to leave at moment's notice stop. "Hide-out is vicinity of Gabelmeister's Peak stop. "Destroy this message all my love full stop." </seg>
<seg id="530"> Where's the basket? Where you headed, mister? Skiing? Sledding? Mountain climbing? </seg>
<seg id="531"> By express wireless, I wrote Agatha with instructions to move to our pre-arranged hideout, a Gypsy caravan on the outer Nebelsbad road, while Monsieur Gustave and I continued east into the Zubrowkian Alps, toward our high-altitude rendezvous with the butler Serge X. As a precaution, we disembarked quietly in the freight yard just outside the station. </seg>
<seg id="532"> L'air de Panache. </seg>
<seg id="533"> It's a hell of a view. I give them that, for what's it's worth. </seg>
<seg id="534"> I agree. "'Tis oft'-remarked, no single, falling-flake does any other - "in its pure and perfect form..." - Somebody's coming. </seg>
<seg id="535"> Are you Monsieur Gustave of the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad? </seg>
<seg id="536"> Get on the next cable car. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Are you Monsieur Gustave of the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad? </seg>
<seg id="538"> Switch with me. </seg>
<seg id="539"> Are you Monsieur Gustave of the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad? </seg>
<seg id="540"> Put these on and sing. </seg>
<seg id="541"> - Are you Monsieur Gustave of the... - Yes, dammit. </seg>
<seg id="542"> Confess. </seg>
<seg id="543"> I'm innocent. </seg>
<seg id="544"> Hmm? No, no. </seg>
<seg id="545"> Forgive me, Monsieur Gustave. I never meant to betray you. </seg>
<seg id="546"> They threatened my life and now they've murdered my only family. No. Who did they kill this time? </seg>
<seg id="547"> - My dear sister. - The girl with the club foot? </seg>
<seg id="548"> - Yes. - Those fuckers! </seg>
<seg id="549"> I tried to warn you at the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="550"> I know, darling. Let's put that behind us. </seg>
<seg id="551"> Listen, I hate to put you on the spot, but I really must ask you to clear my name. </seg>
<seg id="552"> Obviously you're grieving... There's more. To the story. I get it. Go on. </seg>
<seg id="553"> I was the official witness in Madame D's presence to the creation of a second will to be executed only in the event of her death by murder. </seg>
<seg id="554"> - A second will? - Right. - In case she got bumped off? - Right. </seg>
<seg id="555"> - Uh-huh? - But they destroyed it. </seg>
<seg id="556"> - Oh, dear. - However... </seg>
<seg id="557"> - Uh-huh? - I pulled a copy. A second copy of the second will? </seg>
<seg id="558"> - Right. - Uh-huh? </seg>
<seg id="559"> What does it say? Where is it? What's it all about, dammit? </seg>
<seg id="560"> Don't keep us in suspense. This has been a complete fucking nightmare. </seg>
<seg id="561"> Just tell us what the fuck is going on! </seg>
<seg id="562"> Serge? Serge? Serge! </seg>
<seg id="563"> Bloody hell. They've strangled the poor slob. </seg>
<seg id="564"> Come on! Let's go! </seg>
<seg id="565"> - What do we do if we catch him? - I don't know. </seg>
<seg id="566"> He's a homicidal psychopath. Let's stop. </seg>
<seg id="567"> I can't. I can barely steer. </seg>
<seg id="568"> You sick, pathetic creep. I hate you. </seg>
<seg id="569"> "'If this do be me end, farewell!' cried the wounded piper-boy, "whilst the muskets cracked and the yeomen roared 'Hurrah!' "And the ramparts fell. "'Methinks me breathes me last, me fears!' said he..." </seg>
<seg id="570"> Holy shit! You got him! </seg>
<seg id="571"> Well done, Zero! </seg>
<seg id="572"> Gustave H! You are a fugitive from justice! </seg>
<seg id="573"> Surrender lawfully and I will personally vouchsafe your fair treatment. </seg>
<seg id="574"> Do not attempt to flee! </seg>
<seg id="575"> - What do you think? - I don't know. </seg>
<seg id="576"> I'd rather jump off this cliff right now than go back to fucking prison. </seg>
<seg id="577"> I say we steal that sick maniac's motorcycle, go fetch Agatha, take back Boy with Apple and head for the Maltese Riviera, once and for all. </seg>
<seg id="578"> Very good! You're so extraordinary, Zero. Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="579"> A moment of silence in memoriam of a devoted servant killed violently during the conduct of his duties. Goodbye, Serge. </seg>
<seg id="580"> Okay, let's go. </seg>
<seg id="581"> The war began at midnight. </seg>
<seg id="582"> Pffeifelstad fell by lunch under heavy shelling, and 10 battalions surged across the long western border. High-command advanced to Nebelsbad. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Compliments of Herr Mendl, for the executive staff. </seg>
<seg id="584"> General Stieglitz requests a garden-view sitting room with an extra roll-away. </seg>
<seg id="585"> Let's put him in the Duke Leopold Suite. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Secretary Woroniecki's office cabled. </seg>
<seg id="587"> He's checking in a day early. Rooms 401 -2-3. </seg>
<seg id="588"> Tell Tactical Logistics we're moving them to a standard double on the third floor. </seg>
<seg id="589"> They'll need more space than that. </seg>
<seg id="590"> The beginning of the end of the end of the beginning has begun. A sad finale played off-key on a broken-down saloon piano in the outskirts of a forgotten ghost town. </seg>
<seg id="591"> I'd rather not bear witness to such blasphemy. </seg>
<seg id="592"> Me neither. </seg>
<seg id="593"> The Grand Budapest has become a troops' barracks. </seg>
<seg id="594"> I shall never cross its threshold again in my lifetime. </seg>
<seg id="595"> Me neither. Never again shall I... </seg>
<seg id="596"> Actually, I think we might be going in there right now after all. </seg>
<seg id="597"> Dmitri. </seg>
<seg id="598"> Agatha. </seg>
<seg id="599"> Good evening, Mr. Desgoffe und Taxis. I'm Monsieur Chuck. </seg>
<seg id="600"> We've booked you and your sisters into the King Ferdinand Suite. </seg>
<seg id="601"> Good evening. General von Shrecker asked me... </seg>
<seg id="602"> Who's that? I beg your pardon? </seg>
<seg id="603"> I think that girl's got my picture. Excuse me. </seg>
<seg id="604"> Six. Hold it. </seg>
<seg id="605"> Six. </seg>
<seg id="606"> Compliments of Herr Mendl. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Excuse me. </seg>
<seg id="608"> Have you seen a pastry girl with a package under her arm in the last minute and a half? </seg>
<seg id="609"> Yep. She just got on the elevator with Mr. Desgoffe und Taxis. </seg>
<seg id="610"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="611"> I'm sorry. Who are you? </seg>
<seg id="612"> Otto, sir, the new Lobby Boy. </seg>
<seg id="613"> You haven't been trained properly. </seg>
<seg id="614"> A Lobby Boy never provides information of that kind. </seg>
<seg id="615"> You're a stone wall. Understood? </seg>
<seg id="616"> Pretty picture. </seg>
<seg id="617"> Sixth floor. </seg>
<seg id="618"> Where's Boy with Apple? </seg>
<seg id="619"> None of your goddamn business! </seg>
<seg id="620"> I'm going to blast your candy-ass once and for all right now. </seg>
<seg id="621"> Drop your weapon! </seg>
<seg id="622"> Cease fire! Cease fire! Whoa! </seg>
<seg id="623"> Stop it! </seg>
<seg id="624"> Who's shooting who? </seg>
<seg id="625"> That's Gustave H! The escaped murderer and art thief. </seg>
<seg id="626"> I've got him cornered! </seg>
<seg id="627"> That's Dmitri Desgoffe und Taxis! </seg>
<seg id="628"> He's responsible for the killing of Deputy Kovacs, Serge X and his club-footed sister, plus his own mother! </seg>
<seg id="629"> Nobody move. Everybody's under arrest. </seg>
<seg id="630"> Who's out the window? </seg>
<seg id="631"> Agatha! </seg>
<seg id="633"> Hang on! Here I come! </seg>
<seg id="634"> Something's on the back of the... </seg>
<seg id="635"> Agatha! </seg>
<seg id="636"> Agatha! </seg>
<seg id="637"> Are you all right? I think so. </seg>
<seg id="638"> Something's on the back of the picture. </seg>
<seg id="639"> She left everything to Monsieur Gustave, of course. </seg>
<seg id="640"> The mansion, known as Schloss Lutz, the factories, which produced weapons, medicine and textiles, an important newspaper syndicate, and perhaps you've already deduced this very institution, the Grand Budapest Hotel. </seg>
<seg id="641"> He anointed me his successor, and as the war continued, I served my adopted country from the narrow desk still found against the wall in the next room. </seg>
<seg id="642"> He was the same as his disciples, insecure, vain, superficial, blond, needy. In the end he was even rich. </seg>
<seg id="643"> He did not succeed, however, in growing old. </seg>
<seg id="644"> "Dearly beloved, we are gathered together... </seg>
<seg id="645"> Nor did my darling Agatha. </seg>
<seg id="646"> She and our infant son would be killed two years later by the Prussian grippe. An absurd little disease. </seg>
<seg id="647"> Today we treat it in a single week, but, in those days many millions died. </seg>
<seg id="648"> On the 21st day of the occupation, the morning the independent state of Zubrowka officially ceased to exist, we traveled with Monsieur Gustave to Lutz. </seg>
<seg id="649"> In answer to your earlier question, by the way, of course. </seg>
<seg id="650"> Zero asked me about my humble beginnings in the hotel trade. I was, perhaps, for a time, considered the best Lobby Boy we'd ever had at the Grand Budapest. </seg>
<seg id="651"> I think I can say that. </seg>
<seg id="652"> This one finally surpassed me. </seg>
<seg id="653"> Although, I must say, he had an exceptional teacher. </seg>
<seg id="654"> Truly. </seg>
<seg id="655"> "Whence came these two radiant, celestial brothers, "united, for an instant, "as they crossed the stratosphere of our starry window? </seg>
<seg id="656"> "One from the East and one from the West." </seg>
<seg id="657"> Very good. </seg>
<seg id="658"> Don't flirt with her. </seg>
<seg id="659"> Why are we stopping at a barley field again? </seg>
<seg id="660"> I find these black uniforms very drab. </seg>
<seg id="661"> Well, hello there, chaps. We were just talking about you. </seg>
<seg id="662"> - Documents, please. - With pleasure, as always. </seg>
<seg id="663"> You're the first of the official death squads to whom we've been formally introduced. </seg>
<seg id="664"> How do you do? </seg>
<seg id="665"> Plus ça change, am I right? Uh, that's a migratory visa with stage three worker status, darling. </seg>
<seg id="666"> Read this. </seg>
<seg id="667"> Come outside. Now, stay there. </seg>
<seg id="668"> I give you my word, if you lay a finger on this man, I'll see you dishonorably discharged, locked up in the stockade and hanged by sundown. </seg>
<seg id="669"> There are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity. You filthy, goddamn, pock-marked, fascist assholes! </seg>
<seg id="670"> He was one of them. </seg>
<seg id="671"> What more is there to say? </seg>
<seg id="672"> What happened in the end? </seg>
<seg id="673"> In the end they shot him. </seg>
<seg id="674"> So it all went to me. </seg>
<seg id="675"> After dinner, we went to collect the keys to our rooms, but Monsieur Jean had abandoned his post. I expect he's forgotten all about us. </seg>
<seg id="676"> In recent years, of course, such properties and holdings as the Grand Budapest had with very few exceptions become common property. </seg>
<seg id="677"> While the precise terms of his negotiation with the new government had never been announced, the result was an open secret, Zero Moustafa had traded a great and important fortune in exchange for one costly, unprofitable, doomed hotel. </seg>
<seg id="678"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="679"> Was it merely sentimental? </seg>
<seg id="680"> It was quite forward of me and a bit out of character, but I felt I must know, for my health, I suppose. </seg>
<seg id="681"> Forgive me for asking. I hope I haven't upset you. </seg>
<seg id="682"> No, of course not. </seg>
<seg id="683"> Is it simply your last connection to that vanished world, his world, if you will? </seg>
<seg id="684"> His world? </seg>
<seg id="685"> No, I don't think so. </seg>
<seg id="686"> You see, we shared a vocation. It wouldn't have been necessary. </seg>
<seg id="687"> No. The hotel I keep for Agatha. </seg>
<seg id="688"> We were happy here. </seg>
<seg id="689"> For a little while. </seg>
<seg id="690"> To be frank, I think his world had vanished long before he ever entered it. </seg>
<seg id="691"> But, I will say, he certainly sustained the illusion with a marvelous grace. </seg>
<seg id="692"> Are you going up? No, I'll sit for a little while. </seg>
<seg id="693"> Good night. </seg>
<seg id="694"> The next week, I sailed for a cure in South America and began a long, wandering journey abroad. </seg>
<seg id="695"> I did not return to Europe for many years. </seg>
<seg id="696"> It was an enchanting old ruin. </seg>

<doc docid="pillow" genre="subtitles" origlang="en" sysid="sys">
<seg id="1"> ﻿1 It was on my fourth birthday... When my aunt was reading sei shonagon... </seg>
<seg id="2"> That I saw my father and his publisher together... For the first time. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Though I'm certain that any clear understanding of what I had witnessed... </seg>
<seg id="4"> Would have to wait until I was much older. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On my sixth birthday... At the matsuo tiasha shrine in kyoto, </seg>
<seg id="6"> Encouraged by my aunt, I vowed I would keep a diary. A pillow book of my own. </seg>
<seg id="7"> I would fill it with all manner of observations, Just like sei shonagon. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Perhaps one day, like her, I could fill it with accounts of all my lovers. </seg>
<seg id="9"> On the same day as I started to keep my own pillow book, </seg>
<seg id="10"> I met my future husband for the first time. </seg>
<seg id="11"> I was six. He was ten. </seg>
<seg id="12"> We did not exchange a word. </seg>
<seg id="13"> He had been handpicked by my father's publisher. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Like sei shonagon, my sense of smell was very strong. </seg>
<seg id="15"> I enjoyed the smell of paper of all kinds. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It reminded me of the scent of skin. </seg>
<seg id="17"> My mother had taught me mandarin. </seg>
<seg id="18"> When my father painted a japanese greeting... On my face on my birthday, She played her favorite chinese record. </seg>
<seg id="19"> It had been popular when my parents had met in shanghai. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In remembrance of my father and in memory of sei shonagon, I was determined to take lovers who would remind me... </seg>
<seg id="21"> Of the pleasures of calligraphy. </seg>
<seg id="22"> I could not be sure which was more important... </seg>
<seg id="23"> An indifferent calligrapher who was a good lover... </seg>
<seg id="24"> Or an excellent lover who was a poor calligrapher. </seg>
<seg id="25"> I became a wife. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I married. </seg>
<seg id="27"> I acquired a husband. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Whichever way you say it, It was bound to end badly. </seg>
<seg id="29"> I had a ceremonial wedding in style. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Separated from my parents and my aunt, </seg>
<seg id="31"> I confided in my own pillow book more and more frequently. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Like the pillow book of sei shonagon, it was full of lists. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Unlike sei shonagon, all the lists were negative. </seg>
<seg id="34"> That was the first fire. </seg>
<seg id="35"> There was to be a second. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Both fires marked a big change in my life. </seg>
<seg id="37"> When I first arrived in hong kong, I hid. </seg>
<seg id="38"> I lived in kowloon city in the cheapest rooming houses I could find. </seg>
<seg id="39"> I did not want to be found by my parents. Or by my husband. </seg>
<seg id="40"> I tried hard to improve the chinese my mother had taught me. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In the meantime, I was determined... To keep alive my father's tradition. </seg>
<seg id="42"> I learned to type on my 21st birthday, </seg>
<seg id="43"> I tried to give myself my father's blessing. </seg>
<seg id="44"> I found work in the offices of a japanese designer. </seg>
<seg id="45"> And I was determined to speak english with an american accent. </seg>
<seg id="46"> I was planning to go to California. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Twenty meter of pale green organdy, pattern 14. </seg>
<seg id="48"> A meter of type-b tulle. </seg>
<seg id="49"> The small net size. </seg>
<seg id="50"> The type-b tulle with the small net size. </seg>
<seg id="51"> We went to kyoto, back to japan, To work in the matuso tiasha shrine, Which sei shonagon had visited regularly. </seg>
<seg id="52"> I couldn't give up such an opportunity. </seg>
<seg id="53"> I was also a little homesick. </seg>
<seg id="54"> We didn't finish walking the catwalk until midnight... When all the audience had gone. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Sei shonagon had watched the moon rise in that garden... A thousand years ago. </seg>
<seg id="56"> I could have walked up and down that path all night long. </seg>
<seg id="57"> You are not in a position to preach clean living. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Oh, yes, I am. And in blood red. </seg>
<seg id="59"> You could join us. </seg>
<seg id="60"> I'm too beautiful... And too rich. </seg>
<seg id="61"> - What's wealth got to do with it? - A great deal, I'd think. </seg>
<seg id="62"> I design material. You can wear it. </seg>
<seg id="63"> Frighten the buyers. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Then I'd soon cease to be wealthy. </seg>
<seg id="65"> You wouldn't need to be paid. You would do it for free. Oh, yeah? What else would you do for free? </seg>
<seg id="66"> I've been waiting to waste my talent on your body... </seg>
<seg id="67"> For a little reward. </seg>
<seg id="68"> My search for the ideal lover-calligrapher continued. </seg>
<seg id="69"> But it was becoming less and less likely that I would find him. </seg>
<seg id="70"> If they were old, they were invariably in no position... To take advantage of what I had to offer. </seg>
<seg id="71"> And if they were young, they were often easily distracted. </seg>
<seg id="72"> It's them! </seg>
<seg id="73"> Don't look! Don't look. </seg>
<seg id="74"> What are you doing here? Are you responsible for this? </seg>
<seg id="75"> You shrimp! What do you think you're doing? Shut up! </seg>
<seg id="76"> They were children playing a game. </seg>
<seg id="77"> They used hoki, the japanese photographer from tokyo, As a pawn to find me. </seg>
<seg id="78"> I want those photos. </seg>
<seg id="79"> I had once kissed him on the cheek in a moment of happiness. </seg>
<seg id="80"> - You're a creep. - I'm sorry. I have watched you, followed you everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="81"> It's only too obvious. And I could help you. You haven't done too well so far. </seg>
<seg id="82"> You are very beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="83"> I employed a calligrapher... With an obsession for mathematics. </seg>
<seg id="84"> While his wife sang and waited in the kitchen, This account clerk filled my back with additions, My front with subtractions. </seg>
<seg id="85"> I contacted a magazine designer... </seg>
<seg id="86"> Who insisted that I came back to his apartment in the new territories, Where he could show me off to his parents who wanted grandchildren. </seg>
<seg id="87"> - Write "dear nagiko." - What? </seg>
<seg id="88"> - I took risks. - Where? </seg>
<seg id="89"> - Here. - I can't. </seg>
<seg id="90"> - Yes, you can. - Who knows what casual meeting would produce a surprise. </seg>
<seg id="91"> Nagiko? </seg>
<seg id="92"> Some of the great japanese calligraphers... Were very modest and unassuming men. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Humble clerks by day, daring poets by night. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Good. Now write something else here. With great trepidation, I sought to move away from what I knew best. </seg>
<seg id="95"> After all, there were other great calligraphic traditions. </seg>
<seg id="96"> What have you written? That's for you to find out. How am I going to do that? </seg>
<seg id="97"> You know, some cultures permit no images. </seg>
<seg id="98"> Perhaps some cultures ought to permit no visible text. </seg>
<seg id="99"> I need writing. </seg>
<seg id="100"> Don't ask me why. Just take out your pen and, </seg>
<seg id="101"> Please, write your name on my arm. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Go on. </seg>
<seg id="103"> I met an english translator at the cafe typo. </seg>
<seg id="104"> He said he spoke four languages, including yiddish. </seg>
<seg id="105"> I'll give you another chance. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Write on my back. </seg>
<seg id="107"> Well, what shall I write? </seg>
<seg id="108"> Write... </seg>
<seg id="109"> "we met for the first time at the cafe typo." </seg>
<seg id="110"> Write in three languages... </seg>
<seg id="111"> Japanese, french and english. </seg>
<seg id="112"> Waitress! </seg>
<seg id="113"> Are we going to do more writing? </seg>
<seg id="114"> Perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="115"> You smell strange. Do you use perfume? And your fingers. What's wrong with my fingers? </seg>
<seg id="116"> I'll give you another chance. The last one. </seg>
<seg id="117"> Write on my breasts. A little inappropriate. </seg>
<seg id="118"> I'll decide what's inappropriate. </seg>
<seg id="119"> Write in yiddish. What's yiddish for "breasts"? </seg>
<seg id="120"> If you're a writer, surely you'd write on anything? </seg>
<seg id="121"> This is not going to work. </seg>
<seg id="122"> You're not a writer. </seg>
<seg id="123"> This is not writing; It's scribbling. </seg>
<seg id="124"> Distasteful scribbling. </seg>
<seg id="125"> Get out. </seg>
<seg id="126"> You're not a writer; You're a scribbler. </seg>
<seg id="127"> I've watched you with your little typewriter go click, click, clack. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Get out. Go! </seg>
<seg id="129"> You could show me. </seg>
<seg id="130"> - Go on. - No. I can't. </seg>
<seg id="131"> How can I get pleasure writing on you? </seg>
<seg id="132"> You have to write on me. Go on. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Use my body like the pages of a book. </seg>
<seg id="134"> Of your book. </seg>
<seg id="135"> Not a special writing instrument at all. </seg>
<seg id="136"> I began very tentatively, </seg>
<seg id="137"> Thinking of sei shonagon's lists of anatomical comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="138"> The thoughts were often hers, But the words were entirely mine. </seg>
<seg id="139"> For my first experiment in using flesh as paper, I made a deal with an englishman who was entirely ignorant of oriental languages. </seg>
<seg id="140"> Hoki, this is where you can prove you have my interests at heart. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Come here quickly. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Off you go. Beautiful photographs. And you don't get paid because you owe me. </seg>
<seg id="143"> This is where I begin to do the writing. </seg>
<seg id="144"> I'm now going to be the pen, not just the paper. </seg>
<seg id="145"> I could help you. </seg>
<seg id="146"> I think not. </seg>
<seg id="147"> Why not? What's wrong with me? </seg>
<seg id="148"> Because you are from kyoto, and you're young. </seg>
<seg id="149"> And your handwriting is illegible. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Besides, your skin does not make a good paper. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Watch. </seg>
<seg id="152"> You see? In my diary, I called you "the blotter." </seg>
<seg id="153"> Hoki the blotter. </seg>
<seg id="154"> I could help you. </seg>
<seg id="155"> I think not. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Why not? </seg>
<seg id="157"> You're none too smart with compliments. </seg>
<seg id="158"> Let me try. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Let me try. </seg>
<seg id="160"> Hoki set off at dawn for a foreign language bookshop... In kowloon city in a street full of restaurants. He finally gave the packet to some doorman. </seg>
<seg id="161"> "We feel that we are unable to consider... "publication of this material. It's not worth the paper it's written on." </seg>
<seg id="162"> So they're not satisfied with the quality of the paper. </seg>
<seg id="163"> Perhaps it's not japanese enough. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Try writing on me. </seg>
<seg id="165"> Seduce him. </seg>
<seg id="166"> I met jerome in the cafe typo... And asked him for the services of a translator. </seg>
<seg id="167"> He gave me a choice of six languages. </seg>
<seg id="168"> They had increased by two. </seg>
<seg id="169"> I talked to him and I flattered him, </seg>
<seg id="170"> And I admired all the books he had yet to write. </seg>
<seg id="171"> You have to sign here. </seg>
<seg id="172"> Our first transaction was strictly financial. </seg>
<seg id="173"> He wanted to pay the bill but had no money. </seg>
<seg id="174"> He offered to write a check but had no checkbook. </seg>
<seg id="175"> I volunteered the palm of my hand. </seg>
<seg id="176"> If I could not seduce the publisher, Then perhaps I could seduce the publisher's lover. </seg>
<seg id="177"> His writing, in so many languages, Made me a signpost pointing east, west, north and south. </seg>
<seg id="178"> I had shoes in german, stockings in french, Gloves in hebrew, a hat with a veil in italian. </seg>
<seg id="179"> He only kept me naked where I was most accustomed to wear clothes. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Shut up. Go away. Go away. </seg>
<seg id="181"> I would like to honor my father by becoming a writer. </seg>
<seg id="182"> I could help. </seg>
<seg id="183"> I could learn new languages... </seg>
<seg id="184"> To make you understood... All over the world. </seg>
<seg id="185"> When god made his first human being... He painted in the eyes. And lips. And the sex. </seg>
<seg id="186"> And when god approved of his creation... He was obliged to sign his name. </seg>
<seg id="187"> There are so many publishers in the world. Why worry about this one? </seg>
<seg id="188"> I have my reasons. </seg>
<seg id="189"> I suspect it's because he rejected you so swiftly, And few people, if any, have ever done that. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="191"> But... If you're so determined to be published by him, The publisher who rejects you and who loves me... Then I have a plan. </seg>
<seg id="192"> I could be your messenger. You could write on me. </seg>
<seg id="193"> And with your permission and, of course, your blessing, I could... Pay your publishing friend a visit? </seg>
<seg id="194"> A sacrifice? </seg>
<seg id="195"> But not without pleasure for you? </seg>
<seg id="196"> Perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="197"> You could be jealous? </seg>
<seg id="198"> It's worked. He won't let me go. Wait for me. </seg>
<seg id="199"> He's thinking of an edition of 3,000... </seg>
<seg id="200"> If there are more, and there will be more, won't there? </seg>
<seg id="201"> I'll see you this evening. Wait for me here. </seg>
<seg id="202"> Hey, you are enjoying it too much. </seg>
<seg id="203"> But with your permission. And only according to the quality of the writing. </seg>
<seg id="204"> If you don't hurry it along, I'll be looking for someone else. </seg>
<seg id="205"> You dare. </seg>
<seg id="206"> He's making me wait. Buy some new paper. </seg>
<seg id="207"> Don't get so upset. You could use me. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Give me two more of these and some more of this and some stuff for him. </seg>
<seg id="209"> You could have babies. </seg>
<seg id="210"> - They're not bad-looking ladies. - I need some skin, two meters and a half. </seg>
<seg id="211"> - Sorry? - Back and front. </seg>
<seg id="212"> I could give you three and a half. </seg>
<seg id="213"> True, but the quality of the paper would not attract my fastidious publisher. </seg>
<seg id="214"> Jerome! </seg>
<seg id="215"> Jerome! </seg>
<seg id="216"> I need you both. Come with me? </seg>
<seg id="217"> I really do. It's like wild kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="218"> All right, you're gonna like this one. This one's funny. </seg>
<seg id="219"> Hey, you know something? </seg>
<seg id="220"> They got a song about you in america. You know what it's called? </seg>
<seg id="221"> It's called "the hokeypokey." </seg>
<seg id="222"> You get it? "The hokeypokey." </seg>
<seg id="223"> Ready? You put your right foot in you put your right foot out your put your right foot in and you shake it all about you do the hokeypokey. You turn your... </seg>
<seg id="224"> Hello. Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="225"> Americans always say they have nothing to hide. </seg>
<seg id="226"> I can see that's true. </seg>
<seg id="227"> Look what I got here? </seg>
<seg id="228"> It is a menu. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Nagiko! </seg>
<seg id="230"> I know you're there! Let me in! </seg>
<seg id="231"> Don't play games! I know you're there! </seg>
<seg id="232"> Nagiko! </seg>
<seg id="233"> I met your friend. I met your fat friend. </seg>
<seg id="234"> He was nice? Was he nice? </seg>
<seg id="235"> He was covered in my paint! My paint for my body! </seg>
<seg id="236"> Oh, my god! What have I done? What have I done? </seg>
<seg id="237"> Please let me in! </seg>
<seg id="238"> I love you, nagiko. </seg>
<seg id="239"> I love you. Talk to me. </seg>
<seg id="240"> Nagiko! </seg>
<seg id="241"> Please! </seg>
<seg id="242"> I won't play games. </seg>
<seg id="243"> Let me in! Let me in! </seg>
<seg id="244"> Why won't she talk to me? </seg>
<seg id="245"> I don't know. </seg>
<seg id="246"> What do you mean, you don't know? Have you seen her? When did you last see her? </seg>
<seg id="247"> Whiskey. </seg>
<seg id="248"> Whiskey. </seg>
<seg id="249"> She comes here, you know, to pick up her clients. </seg>
<seg id="250"> She almost lives here. </seg>
<seg id="251"> The waiters are all pimps. </seg>
<seg id="252"> She makes sure they are very smooth-skinned. </seg>
<seg id="253"> You know? Between the legs? </seg>
<seg id="254"> Her maid usually washes them... With lemon juice to make their skin soft... And smooth. </seg>
<seg id="255"> But you could scare her. </seg>
<seg id="256"> You are a writer, </seg>
<seg id="257"> Like in romeo and juliet. </seg>
<seg id="258"> Shakespeare? </seg>
<seg id="259"> Jerome! </seg>
<seg id="260"> Jerome, I'm sorry. </seg>
<seg id="261"> We can start again from where we left off. </seg>
<seg id="262"> I was angry. You deceived me... </seg>
<seg id="263"> With a man I detest, with a man who blackmailed my father. </seg>
<seg id="264"> But... We can revenge him. </seg>
<seg id="265"> We need to work. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Jerome! </seg>
<seg id="267"> Jerome! </seg>
<seg id="268"> Jerome always wanted to be foreign, Though not necessarily oriental. </seg>
<seg id="269"> English wasn't enough for him. </seg>
<seg id="270"> He'd never have made a writer. </seg>
<seg id="271"> He didn't have enough imagination. </seg>
<seg id="272"> Jerome was dyslexic until he was 12, Before it became fashionable. </seg>
<seg id="273"> And he broke every pair of glasses I gave him. </seg>
<seg id="274"> He hated wearing glasses. </seg>
<seg id="275"> He was very good at breaking things, </seg>
<seg id="276"> Especially relationships, just like his father. </seg>
<seg id="277"> His father was a catholic convert, always experimenting with faith. </seg>
<seg id="278"> We called our first son paul and our second jerome... After his father's confessor, who was a jesuit in singapore. </seg>
<seg id="279"> Jerome never liked me. </seg>
<seg id="280"> He preferred my sister, A little fool who was excited by modern literature. All swear words and scatology, before it became fashionable. </seg>
<seg id="281"> I hear you're fashionable. </seg>
<seg id="282"> I suppose that's what excited jerome. </seg>
<seg id="283"> We burned an effigy of jerome's car. We didn't burn his books. </seg>
<seg id="284"> They were too damp. </seg>
<seg id="285"> I burned my books... And my clothes and shoes... And the photographs and diaries. </seg>
<seg id="286"> It was the second major fire in my life. </seg>
<seg id="287"> The first fire had taken me out of japan. The second took me back. </seg>
<seg id="288"> Hoki wrote to me. </seg>
<seg id="289"> Even after jerome's death, he was still very, very jealous. </seg>
<seg id="290"> He wrote to tell me about the publisher's act of sacrilege. </seg>
<seg id="291"> I had promised jerome 13 books. </seg>
<seg id="292"> I could not now write them on jerome's body. </seg>
<seg id="293"> I found substitutes in japan. </seg>
<seg id="294"> I would write the books for the publisher as a bargain... For the return of the pillow book he had made of jerome's body. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Now you've been signed by me, You can go and do my business. </seg>
<seg id="296"> Excuse me. Can I see the manager, please? </seg>
<seg id="297"> Let's take another photograph. </seg>
<seg id="298"> Excuse me. Give it to the manager and tell him we are here. </seg>

<seg id="10"> He's on his way. </seg>
<seg id="11"> At least you're dry. </seg>
<seg id="12"> You must be joking! </seg>
<seg id="13"> It's like a cheap American film. When do you read me my rights? </seg>
<seg id="14"> You can take off your shoes if you want. </seg>
<seg id="15"> I wet myself. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It happens sometimes. When you're old. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Isn't that so? </seg>
<seg id="18"> I have to make a call. Where's the phone? </seg>
<seg id="19"> Sorry, that's not possible. </seg>
<seg id="20"> What d'you mean - not possible? It's my right! I have to tell them I'll be late. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Drop it, it's not possible. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Ask the Inspector when he gets here. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Whoever you are, I'll also tell him how you treated me. You're in trouble. I'm not some nobody! </seg>
<seg id="24"> I don't have the honor of knowing you. But whoever you are, you'll see we don't play favorites here! </seg>
<seg id="25"> Get that through your head! </seg>
<seg id="26"> Tell the Inspector anything you like. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Can you tell me the time or do I have to wait for Bogart? </seg>
<seg id="28"> It's 9:15. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Shut up! </seg>

<seg id="32"> Sorry... I apologize. </seg>
<seg id="33"> It's just that I'm expected. I have a very important meeting. Very important. </seg>
<seg id="34"> With the Minister of Culture. </seg>
<seg id="35"> I have to prepare myself... I can't go like... </seg>
<seg id="36"> The Inspector's on his way. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Got a cigarette? Find him a cigarette. </seg>
<seg id="38"> But, captain, I don't smoke. Me neither. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The Inspector smokes, I hope. </seg>
<seg id="40"> An Inspector always smokes. </seg>
<seg id="41"> An Inspector smokes a pipe... An Inspector chomps on a cigar... </seg>
<seg id="42"> Drink this, It'll do you good. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Take it. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Drink. It'll warm you. Drink. </seg>

<seg id="46"> It'll do you good. Go on. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Drink. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Drink. </seg>
<seg id="49"> You son of a bitch! </seg>
<seg id="50"> Bastard! Bastard! </seg>
<seg id="51"> A nasty business. </seg>
<seg id="52"> We really needed this. </seg>
<seg id="53"> With this rain, I was better off in bed. </seg>
<seg id="54"> He's coming around. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Try to sit up. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Give him a hand. I'll manage, leave me alone. </seg>
<seg id="57"> I assume you're the Inspector. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Excellent assumption. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Well, then you owe me a few explanations. </seg>
<seg id="60"> By what right are you holding me here? Why wouldn't your men let me contact my family? Who authorized them to beat me like an animal? </seg>
<seg id="61"> Answer me. </seg>
<seg id="62"> I asked you three simple questions. </seg>
<seg id="63"> Ordinarily I'm the one who asks questions. </seg>
<seg id="64"> From what I hear, you brought this on yourself. Nonetheless, I'm sorry I'm late. </seg>
<seg id="65"> - As a rule, I'm quite punctual... - I don't care how punctual you are! </seg>
<seg id="66"> I have no desire to know it. </seg>
<seg id="67"> I just want to know what I'm doing here. </seg>
<seg id="68"> I'll try to satisfy your curiosity. </seg>
<seg id="69"> But first I'd like to know who I'm dealing with. Seeing as you were out walking miles from anywhere in a downpour, with no raincoat no... umbrella, nothing in your pockets, not even any ID... It's neither a felony nor a misdemeanor to be without ID. </seg>
<seg id="70"> It must be in my wallet on my desk... - Naturally. - ...or in another jacket. </seg>
<seg id="71"> But first, I'd like to know who it is I'm talking to. </seg>
<seg id="72"> A trucker? A boxer, a dentist, an astrologer? Maybe a judge, since you are such an expert on felony and misdemeanor, crimes? </seg>
<seg id="73"> Once people knew who I was before I even said hello. But I don't want to... take advantage of my celebrity. No... My name is Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="74"> And mine is Leonardo Da Vinci. </seg>
<seg id="75"> You don't believe me? </seg>
<seg id="76"> That's your right. </seg>
<seg id="77"> What's perhaps less your right is arresting people simply for walking in the rain. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Does rain bother you so much mister Leonardo Da Vinci? </seg>
<seg id="79"> I am Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="80"> If you doubt me, go get my ID or send your henchmen, </seg>
<seg id="81"> It's your work. </seg>
<seg id="82"> I own the farmhouse on the River Choron. I must've left it on the kitchen table or in a shirt pocket or on my bed. </seg>
<seg id="83"> "Even now I sometimes doubt I ever... lived those days, ever made fast that friendship, ever knew this man whose body has just fallen before my eyes. </seg>
<seg id="84"> This body gasped for breath, and I wrote these pages. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Those vacant eyes cried out for expression, those lips pleaded for a final whimper, this dream was missing a kind of dreamer..." </seg>
<seg id="86"> Charming little speech. And very well-said. But it leaves me cold. I don't understand it, Mr. Da Vinci. </seg>
<seg id="87"> What you call my little speech is quite simply a quote from a great novel by a writer named Onoff! Onoff... </seg>
<seg id="88"> You really have no luck, do you? No luck at all! Because in a place like this where nothing ever happens, you have plenty of time to read. </seg>
<seg id="89"> And I read a lot, days on end, weeks on end, book after book, book after book... </seg>
<seg id="90"> You can't imagine the number of books I read, even re-read the ones I like best: </seg>
<seg id="91"> "The Palace of Nine Frontiers", "Degrees", "Hatred", "Geometry", "A Treatise on Pleasure", "Nero", "The Two Torches"... All books by Onoff. He's my favorite writer. In my humble opinion, he's a genius. </seg>
<seg id="92"> You couldn't have made a worse choice. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Onoff... I know his biography like the back of my hand. </seg>
<seg id="94"> You see, old man, walking in the rain at night isn't too serious by itself. </seg>
<seg id="95"> Leaving your ID at home in a jacket pocket is merely stupid. Attempting to escape police custody, even the most inept, by assaulting officers of the law is a bit riskier. </seg>
<seg id="96"> But doing it all in the space of a few hours, then giving a false identity, that's... very, very risky. </seg>
<seg id="97"> Andre! </seg>
<seg id="98"> I'm ready, sir! It may not be necessary, I doubt it'll take long. Who is winning? Me, but he has the Mikado. The Mikado doesn't beat a steady hand. Fix me a cup of coffee. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Stand up. </seg>
<seg id="100"> What's your name? </seg>
<seg id="101"> Let's not waste time. Your name? </seg>
<seg id="102"> What's your name? </seg>
<seg id="103"> What's your name? Shit! </seg>
<seg id="104"> "He was standing by the armoire when Mrs. d'Oneiras' car drove into the courtyard. </seg>
<seg id="105"> The maid hurried out. She held the door open, curtseyed, then ushered her in. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Mrs. d'Oneiras slowly climbed the semicircular staircase. </seg>
<seg id="107"> She was beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="108"> She took a morsel of cooked fish from the pocket of her skirt and proceeded to eat it. </seg>
<seg id="109"> As she ate, she stared straight ahead, seeing nothing... </seg>
<seg id="110"> When she came in, he moved away from the armoire and went toward her, but she didn't look at him. </seg>
<seg id="111"> She passed by him, barely a centimeter away, as if he didn't exist." </seg>
<seg id="112"> That Mrs. d'Oneiras... </seg>
<seg id="113"> The bit of herring in the skirt pocket... </seg>
<seg id="114"> That's from "Degrees". It's when Mrs. d'Oneiras breaks off with him. </seg>
<seg id="115"> The middle of the book. Not "Degrees". </seg>
<seg id="116"> "Stairways", Inspector. </seg>
<seg id="117"> "Stairways", chapter three, </seg>
<seg id="118"> "The return of the Druze". </seg>
<seg id="119"> Giving a false identity is very risky, Leonardo Da Vinci, old prick! </seg>
<seg id="120"> Prince Cosimo's speech, before laying the tiles? </seg>
<seg id="121"> "That's why I followed you here, and that's why this park if full of kneeling men..." "...and derelict dancers..." </seg>
<seg id="122"> "And that's why in this frescoed corner, where these two walls meet..." "...you see squatting figures, defecating in the shadows." </seg>
<seg id="123"> Correct? </seg>
<seg id="124"> You say you know my biography like the back if your hand. </seg>
<seg id="125"> I am 48 years old. I've written novels, articles, songs, plays. </seg>
<seg id="126"> I myself directed, very badly, my last play, "Nero". </seg>
<seg id="127"> I've published nothing for 6 years. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Is that enough? </seg>
<seg id="129"> Onoff! </seg>
<seg id="130"> The great Onoff, here! </seg>
<seg id="131"> How could I not have recognized you right away? </seg>
<seg id="132"> It's... I... What can I say to apologize? Allow me to shake your hand. </seg>
<seg id="133"> I am sorry about the shabby welcome we gave you. </seg>
<seg id="134"> Never mind. Not a big deal. You're soaking wet! </seg>
<seg id="135"> Towels, quickly, and dry clothes! And shoes, too. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Would you like coffee? </seg>
<seg id="137"> Another coffee! </seg>
<seg id="138"> Just a moment, Mr. Inspector. May I make a call? Well, of course, but... The lines are busy. </seg>
<seg id="139"> How... how... How could I possibly have failed to recognize you? </seg>
<seg id="140"> I must have seen your face hundreds of times. </seg>
<seg id="141"> You know, flash bulbs, news, shots, TV... </seg>
<seg id="142"> - They conceal more than reveal. - Of course, but... </seg>
<seg id="143"> What is someone like you doing here in the middle of nowhere? </seg>
<seg id="144"> - I owe a house in the mountain, where sometimes... - Women! </seg>
<seg id="145"> If it pleases you to think so... I shouldn't pry into what doesn't concern me. I'm seldom here, unfortunately. </seg>
<seg id="146"> I go there to work. It helps me concentrate. </seg>
<seg id="147"> A new book? </seg>
<seg id="148"> You are writing a new book, er! I've guessed, have I? </seg>
<seg id="149"> Bravo, you've guessed. </seg>
<seg id="150"> And... have you been here long? Three or four days. </seg>
<seg id="151"> I got there Thursday, today's Sunday. That makes four. </seg>
<seg id="152"> The beard! That's it! You always had a beard, that's why I didn't recognize you! </seg>
<seg id="153"> Coffee, Mr. Inspector. </seg>
<seg id="154"> I brought you shoes. Can you open the door? Yes. I am going. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The gardener's boots. </seg>
<seg id="156"> A bit too big, but at least they're dry. Doesn't matter. Thanks. Thanks. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Sorry about what happened earlier. How is your hand? </seg>
<seg id="158"> Don't worry. I'll survive. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Thanks for the boots. </seg>
<seg id="160"> Well, Inspector, nothing left but to thank you  for your kind words about my work. </seg>
<seg id="161"> No, I'm the one to thank you. </seg>
<seg id="162"> You don't know how happy I am to have met you, to have shaken the hand that creates the world where I so enjoyed living. </seg>
<seg id="163"> I wouldn't like to abuse your hospitality but, if you could have me driven home... </seg>
<seg id="164"> Yes, of course. That way, I can return the clothes and the boots. </seg>
<seg id="165"> Of course. Of course, but... this is very awkward... how to tell you... </seg>
<seg id="166"> My ID? I'll send that back, too. </seg>
<seg id="167"> No, it's not that. </seg>
<seg id="168"> What is it, then? Nothing serious, I assure you... </seg>
<seg id="169"> But... You'll have to stay a while longer. </seg>
<seg id="170"> - All right, if you think it's necessary... - As I said, nothing major. A few questions. Just a formality. </seg>
<seg id="171"> It won't take long. I'd appreciate that, I'm very tired. </seg>
<seg id="172"> You wanted to make a phone call. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Give me a number, I'll have it put through. </seg>
<seg id="174"> Easy to remember. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Is it your number? </seg>
<seg id="176"> No... A lady friend of mine. </seg>
<seg id="177"> Andre... Put this number through to my direct line, 93... </seg>
<seg id="178"> What's the subject of your new book? </seg>
<seg id="179"> Is this an interview? </seg>
<seg id="180"> Since you know me so well, you know I quit giving them years ago. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Yes, of course. Though I never understood why. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Interviews are pointless. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Someone visits you to make you say, what he already knows, for the pleasure of hearing you repeat it. In a way, yes. </seg>
<seg id="184"> But it's different with me. </seg>
<seg id="185"> I want you to tell me everything you did today. Today, Sunday. And that, I assure you, is something I don't know. </seg>
<seg id="186"> So it's not an interview. It's an interrogation. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Call it what you like... But I ask you to bear with me. </seg>
<seg id="188"> It's not easy to put these questions to a man I admire so much. - Then don't do it. I must, Mr. Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="189"> I must. It's your own interest. </seg>
<seg id="190"> As you see, we are alone, noting you say will be taken down. </seg>
<seg id="191"> Tell me how you spent your day, and when you are finished, I give you my word, we'll leave you in peace. </seg>
<seg id="192"> Got a cigarette? I am sorry, nobody here smokes... </seg>
<seg id="193"> All right, never mind. Forget it. </seg>
<seg id="194"> You smoke a lot? </seg>
<seg id="195"> Three packs a day. A bit more lately. </seg>
<seg id="196"> And today? Today I broke all records. </seg>
<seg id="197"> What time did you wake up this morning? I always wake up in 3:30 in the morning. </seg>
<seg id="198"> How can you be so precise? I don't sleep much. An hour, an hour and a half... Never more than two. Every day for the last ten years I've woken up at exactly 3:30 in the morning. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Just like Shannon in "Geometry". Right, like the hero of "Geometry". </seg>
<seg id="200"> - It's an obsession with you. - I guess it is. </seg>
<seg id="201"> I must say I was surprised when you didn't recognize my quote: </seg>
<seg id="202"> "Those lips pleaded for a final whimper". It's magnificent... </seg>
<seg id="203"> Do you remember the names of all you suspects? Everyone you arrested, questioned, sent to jail? </seg>
<seg id="204"> You remember their faces, their hair, every word they said? Frankly, I doubt it. </seg>
<seg id="205"> No one can remember everything. </seg>
<seg id="206"> That passage you quoted, might be from "The Palace...", maybe... </seg>
<seg id="207"> That's it, that's it! </seg>
<seg id="208"> Beginning of the last chapter! It is magnificent! We were discussing insomnia. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Yes. I had insomnia, too. For years. </seg>
<seg id="210"> I tried everything, every remedy possible or imaginable... </seg>
<seg id="211"> Sleeping pills by truckload. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Nothing helped. </seg>
<seg id="213"> Then, a few years ago, all at once it stopped, like that. Overnight. </seg>
<seg id="214"> Don't lose hope. Maybe it'll happen to you. </seg>
<seg id="215"> I don't want my insomnia cured. </seg>
<seg id="216"> It suits me fine, it's my number-one collaborator. It means I can write while others sleep. </seg>
<seg id="217"> Did you also work last night? - Less than usual. - Did you went back to sleep? No. </seg>
<seg id="218"> No? Then, what did you do? </seg>
<seg id="219"> I stared for ages at the ceiling. And the ceiling stared for ages at me. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Alone? </seg>
<seg id="221"> I mean, you were alone in bed? </seg>
<seg id="222"> You, Inspector, are a man of boundless tact. </seg>
<seg id="223"> Yes, I was alone. You were alone. And then? </seg>
<seg id="224"> Then I got up before cock-crow. </seg>
<seg id="225"> I put on my robe and my slippers, one by one. </seg>
<seg id="226"> I went down to the kitchen. </seg>
<seg id="227"> I drank a cup of coffee accompanied by a spoonful of sugar. </seg>
<seg id="228"> I took a huge crap. </seg>
<seg id="229"> I scratched my head. I washed myself, dressed. Made a phone call, tore up everything I'd written yesterday, and made notes on what I'd write tomorrow. </seg>
<seg id="230"> And then I went for a walk. </seg>
<seg id="231"> After that I came back home and reorganized the attic. </seg>
<seg id="232"> And then? </seg>
<seg id="233"> Then, I drove to the train station to pick up my agent. </seg>
<seg id="234"> What's your agent's name? - Danielle. - Danielle what? </seg>
<seg id="235"> Danielle February. </seg>
<seg id="236"> You drove to the train station to pick up Danielle February? </seg>
<seg id="237"> - Then? We had lunch, we talked about work... </seg>
<seg id="238"> Later on I took her back to the station. What time? </seg>
<seg id="239"> Between 5 and 6 in the evening. </seg>
<seg id="240"> She left and I went home. What time? </seg>
<seg id="241"> About 7. And then? </seg>
<seg id="242"> Then... - Then? Then? </seg>
<seg id="243"> I don't remember very well. </seg>
<seg id="244"> You don't remember very well? </seg>
<seg id="245"> No, I don't remember. </seg>
<seg id="246"> You don't remember? </seg>
<seg id="247"> But...You went back home, after the station, in 7 in the evening... </seg>
<seg id="248"> I can't remember... I've forgotten, I've... It's ridiculous! </seg>
<seg id="249"> You don't remember what you did just a few hours ago? </seg>
<seg id="250"> You think that's normal? Is it a crime to forget? </seg>
<seg id="251"> You are bullshitting me, Mr. Onoff! </seg>
<seg id="252"> Bullshitting me! Up my ass, Inspector! </seg>
<seg id="253"> What do you think I did? Why does it matter? </seg>
<seg id="254"> - What do you care? - OK, let's begin again. From the top. </seg>
<seg id="255"> This changes everything, Mr. Genius. </seg>
<seg id="256"> I sincerely wanted to help you, </seg>
<seg id="257"> I have the greatest respect for what you do, for you work... But until you and your memory make contact, you are not leaving here. </seg>
<seg id="258"> Help me? I don't need help. What do you suspect in your hidebound little hick-cop brain? </seg>
<seg id="259"> Let's start. Name? </seg>
<seg id="260"> What's your name? </seg>
<seg id="261"> It's a simple question, dammit! </seg>
<seg id="262"> I won't answer until I've made a phone call. You can't call and you won't call. </seg>
<seg id="263"> You can't call. </seg>
<seg id="264"> I have the right to call my lawyer! </seg>
<seg id="265"> I won't answer your stupid questions without my lawyer! </seg>
<seg id="266"> Look here... - I know your rights. </seg>
<seg id="267"> You've refused me everything from the start! </seg>
<seg id="268"> First your guardian angels: "Ask the Inspector, wait for the Inspector". Then you... "Give me the number, I'll get it on my direct line". </seg>
<seg id="269"> Why can't I call from this jerkwater dump? </seg>
<seg id="270"> The lines are out of order. Good enough? </seg>
<seg id="271"> Well, Inspector, in all my career as a writer I never indulged in such exuberant flights of fancy. Hats off! </seg>
<seg id="272"> It's true, Mr. Onoff. whenever there is a storm, the first thing to go is the phone. In fact, it's a wonder we still have power. </seg>
<seg id="273"> - You should've said before. - I give my word, </seg>
<seg id="274"> once the lines are fixed, you'll be the first to call. </seg>
<seg id="275"> Go on. Your name? - Why? - Why what? These questions. Please, your name. Why this interrogation, Inspector? </seg>
<seg id="276"> Someone was murdered tonight not far from your house. </seg>
<seg id="277"> Sit down. </seg>
<seg id="278"> Congratulations, Inspector, you've already got your killer. </seg>
<seg id="279"> I don't think for a second that you are a killer. But if you keep trying me to make me believe that you don't remember a thing you did after 7 in the evening, I'll be forced to think you are. </seg>
<seg id="280"> So, your name, if you please. My name is Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="281"> Place and date of birth. February 3, 1946, in Vercere. </seg>
<seg id="282"> - Profession. - Writer. - Married? - Twice married. </seg>
<seg id="283"> Meaning... My first wife died not long after our wedding. </seg>
<seg id="284"> In what circumstances? Cancer. </seg>
<seg id="285"> You remarried? I divorced nine years ago. </seg>
<seg id="286"> Children? None. </seg>
<seg id="287"> Prior offences? Like what? How many times I ripped off a supermarket? How many people I killed before tonight? </seg>
<seg id="288"> Denies any prior offences. </seg>
<seg id="289"> What brought you to this wasteland? I've already told you twice. </seg>
<seg id="290"> I came to my farmhouse to concentrate. Away from everything. Away from police inspectors. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Were you alone? Just a second, sir. </seg>
<seg id="292"> - Were you alone when you came to the house? - No. </seg>
<seg id="293"> Who was with you? My wife. </seg>
<seg id="294"> You married a third time? </seg>
<seg id="295"> No, I mean my second wife. My former second wife, if you prefer. </seg>
<seg id="296"> - You reconciled? No, no. We see each other regularly. </seg>
<seg id="297"> You might say we've become friends. Well... almost friends. </seg>
<seg id="298"> How many bedrooms is there in your farmhouse? </seg>
<seg id="299"> When we are together we sleep together if that's the question. </seg>
<seg id="300"> So, when you woke at 3:30 in the morning to contemplate the ceiling, you weren't alone? </seg>
<seg id="301"> Obviously not. Why did you tell me you were? </seg>
<seg id="302"> I didn't say that. Read the transcript. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Not now! Before you said you woke up just before cock-crow and you were alone. I made a mistake! </seg>
<seg id="304"> Anyway, we are always alone. </seg>
<seg id="305"> How long have you been here? About nine days. </seg>
<seg id="306"> How can you be sure? How can I be sure? </seg>
<seg id="307"> If I say nine days, it's nine days! - Why did you tell me four? - I didn't say four! You did, you said four days. So, I counted wrong. </seg>
<seg id="308"> I loose all track of time when I work Besides... That's why we work: to lose consciousness. </seg>
<seg id="309"> Listen to me, Mr. Onoff. If you contradict yourself in your novels or your poems, that's fine. But if you keep contradicting yourself in a murder investigation, then that's... </seg>
<seg id="310"> Any more and we'll all drawn! </seg>
<seg id="311"> We'll take care of it, Mr. Inspector. </seg>
<seg id="312"> How can you live in a place like that? </seg>
<seg id="313"> How can we live in a place like this! </seg>
<seg id="314"> We are ready, Mr. Inspector. </seg>
<seg id="315"> Excuse me! </seg>
<seg id="316"> Yes? </seg>
<seg id="317"> A while back, I noticed... Bottles. I think it was wine. </seg>
<seg id="318"> Could I have some? </seg>
<seg id="319"> It's a good wine. </seg>
<seg id="320"> Best in the region. </seg>
<seg id="321"> - Here. - Thanks. </seg>
<seg id="322"> Thanks. </seg>
<seg id="323"> - Good, eh? - I'll say! </seg>
<seg id="324"> Have some more. To bring you luck. </seg>
<seg id="325"> It's February 3rd. You birthday, right? </seg>
<seg id="326"> So it is. Yes, indeed. </seg>
<seg id="327"> Can I ask you a question? What else do you do here? </seg>
<seg id="328"> When I whistled that tune before, you got mad, remember? </seg>
<seg id="329"> It wasn't you I was mad at. I am sorry. I apologize. </seg>
<seg id="330"> Let's give them a hand. </seg>
<seg id="331"> No, it's because... I know I whistle off key but... - You recognized the tune? - I recognized it. </seg>
<seg id="332"> I guess everyone in the world had told you that. But... To me that song is a big part of my life. </seg>
<seg id="333"> Here we go! What'd I tell you! </seg>
<seg id="334"> Come sit down please. </seg>
<seg id="335"> Andre, I don't know where the candles are. </seg>
<seg id="336"> Look around, they are over there! </seg>
<seg id="337"> Hurry up! </seg>
<seg id="338"> Mister! Mister! I'll pour you some more wine. Where's your glass? </seg>
<seg id="339"> Andre, open up! What's going on? Break down the door! </seg>
<seg id="340"> - Your name? - Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="341"> Date and place of birth. </seg>
<seg id="342"> February 3, in Vercere. Saint Blaise's day. </seg>
<seg id="343"> - Year? - 1946. </seg>
<seg id="344"> - Profession? - Writer. </seg>
<seg id="345"> - Married? - Twice. </seg>
<seg id="346"> - Children? - None. </seg>
<seg id="347"> How many days ago did you come to your country house? </seg>
<seg id="348"> Four. </seg>
<seg id="349"> First you said four, then nine. Now it is four again? </seg>
<seg id="350"> Four. </seg>
<seg id="351"> Who did you come with? </seg>
<seg id="352"> My ex-second wife. </seg>
<seg id="353"> - What's your ex-second wife name? - Danielle. </seg>
<seg id="354"> Danielle February. </seg>
<seg id="355"> Isn't that your agent? The same thing. </seg>
<seg id="356"> What does that mean? It means my ex-second wife is my agent. </seg>
<seg id="357"> So she is the one you took to the train station? Yes. </seg>
<seg id="358"> What time? Before dusk. </seg>
<seg id="359"> What did you do then? I stayed home. </seg>
<seg id="360"> You stayed home? Or you went home? </seg>
<seg id="361"> I stayed home all day long. </seg>
<seg id="362"> All day long... </seg>
<seg id="363"> Can I have some wine? </seg>
<seg id="364"> If you didn't leave home all day long, how could you take Danielle February to the station? </seg>
<seg id="365"> I didn't take her. She went by herself. </seg>
<seg id="366"> After she left, who came to see you? </seg>
<seg id="367"> Nobody. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Are you sure? I am sure. </seg>
<seg id="369"> I didn't go out all evening. Please believe me. </seg>
<seg id="370"> What did you do after your ex-second wife left? Answer. What did you do? </seg>
<seg id="371"> I don't remember what I did next. </seg>
<seg id="372"> But you say you didn't go out all day. </seg>
<seg id="373"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="374"> How do you know, if you don't remember what you did? </seg>
<seg id="375"> Don't remember... </seg>
<seg id="376"> Could we say you didn't go out during the time you remember? Yes. </seg>
<seg id="377"> So it's possible you went out... afterward. </seg>
<seg id="378"> I don't remember. </seg>
<seg id="379"> I no longer ask you to remember. </seg>
<seg id="380"> Merely to admit you've been talking a load of crap! </seg>
<seg id="381"> First you claimed you came here alone, your agent came to visit, and you took her to the station. Somewhere between 5 and 5:30. </seg>
<seg id="382"> Then thinking it over, you came with your wife. Your ex-wife. Your ex-second wife, who's also your agent. </seg>
<seg id="383"> Only you didn't take her to the station, she took herself to the station. </seg>
<seg id="384"> Mr. Onoff... </seg>
<seg id="385"> At that station... At that station, not so much as one lousy train has stopped for one lousy minute since you came to your farmhouse. For the simple reason that there's never been a station here! </seg>
<seg id="386"> Never! </seg>
<seg id="387"> You are not worthy of the books you've written. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Your novels, your poems, your plays, your songs are a better bargain then you are. I hope so. </seg>
<seg id="389"> Now let's say the truth. Confess! You are making the biggest mistake of your career, which I would guess is not particularly brilliant. </seg>
<seg id="390"> Then why did you try to run off like a thief? </seg>
<seg id="391"> Why don't you prove your innocence? Why not put an end to my suspicions? </seg>
<seg id="392"> I'll tell you why. Because tonight you committed murder. </seg>
<seg id="393"> I don't know if anyone was murdered. </seg>
<seg id="394"> If someone was murdered, I don't know where. If somewhere someone actually was murdered, I don't know who. A little old lady, a child, a goat, a scarecrow! </seg>
<seg id="395"> You don't know a thing, yet it's you who'll tell us who the victim is. </seg>
<seg id="396"> You accuse me of murder and I'm supposed to name the victim? You are supposed to tell me who it is! </seg>
<seg id="397"> What kind of cop are you? A retard, a madman? </seg>
<seg id="398"> I was never an ace detective and maybe I never will be. But during my not particularly brilliant career </seg>
<seg id="399"> I've handled a lot of homicides. Some I never solved. In others I made some fancy deductions which turned out to be all wrong. Once in a while I was lucky enough to stumble on the right trail and discover a few little keys which worked very nicely in a few little locks. </seg>
<seg id="400"> Very rarely I broke the case using my own intelligence. </seg>
<seg id="401"> But this is the first homicide I've dealt with where the only mystery left to solve is the identity of the corpse. </seg>
<seg id="402"> Unfortunately, I can't do it. The victim's face is horribly mutilated and we can't start identification proceedings until tomorrow. </seg>
<seg id="403"> Know what I think? </seg>
<seg id="404"> No. </seg>
<seg id="405"> I think you are the murderer. </seg>
<seg id="406"> You killed the guy, and the ideal scapegoat came along just at the right time! </seg>
<seg id="407"> How do you know it's a man? - What man? - You said: "Know what I think? You are the murderer. You killed the guy." </seg>
<seg id="408"> You're twisting my words! </seg>
<seg id="409"> But you do know it's a man! </seg>
<seg id="410"> I don't know anything! You are trying to confuse me. </seg>
<seg id="411"> You know very well whether it's a man or a woman. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Either way, you have no evidence against me. </seg>
<seg id="413"> A trivial lapse of memory doesn't prove a thing. </seg>
<seg id="414"> "Trivial lapse of memory"... </seg>
<seg id="415"> "So as not to die of anguish or of shame, men are eternally condemned to forget the unpleasant moments of their lives. </seg>
<seg id="416"> And the more unpleasant they are, the faster they are forgotten." </seg>
<seg id="417"> This... That's by you, my dear Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="418"> The man who has written this must have done something very unpleasant indeed to make him forget this actions of just a few hours ago. If writers knew whose mouths end up spewing out their works, they'd cut off their hands. </seg>
<seg id="419"> And it would be a pity. </seg>
<seg id="420"> You believe in God? After all, He is the Great Writer. </seg>
<seg id="421"> If He'd had to allow for the morons who'd later lay claim to His works, to give up too many plans. It's not hard to believe in God. </seg>
<seg id="422"> I believed in Him many times. But I must say I was often ashamed for Him. </seg>
<seg id="423"> He would've been an excellent writer, if only He'd stuck to describing scenery. </seg>
<seg id="424"> Excuse me, Mr. Inspector. I didn't quite get that. </seg>
<seg id="425"> Mr. Onoff, here present, claims God is a second rate writer. </seg>
<seg id="426"> Why do you get so annoyed when I quote your books? </seg>
<seg id="427"> My job is to write. Hearing about my works doesn't interest me. </seg>
<seg id="428"> Language no longer has any purpose in today's world. </seg>
<seg id="429"> It's only good for police interrogations. </seg>
<seg id="430"> I see why you haven't published in six years. </seg>
<seg id="431"> I thought it was another of your creative breakdowns. </seg>
<seg id="432"> What are you talking about? </seg>
<seg id="433"> Three years of silence preceding "The Palace of Nine Frontiers". </seg>
<seg id="434"> It's a long time ago, but... I recall the press went on about breakdown. Breakdown, an endless terror of the blank page, right? </seg>
<seg id="435"> Bravo! </seg>
<seg id="436"> You know more about me than I remember myself. That's for sure! </seg>
<seg id="437"> Disappointed? </seg>
<seg id="438"> Frankly, yes. </seg>
<seg id="439"> We should never come face to face with our own idols. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Seen close up, they turn out to have pimples. </seg>
<seg id="441"> We may find out that the great works which inspired our dreams were thought up while sitting on the john, during a bout of diarrhea! </seg>
<seg id="442"> Aside from me, do you have many enemies? Oh, yes! </seg>
<seg id="443"> One made a face at me just today and I don't know why, but I killed him. </seg>
<seg id="444"> Have you ever owned a gun? </seg>
<seg id="445"> No. Sure? </seg>
<seg id="446"> I've never owned a weapon of any kind. </seg>
<seg id="447"> I don't know how to shoot, I've never shot. </seg>
<seg id="448"> You are going in circles, Inspector. You'd better to question the body you hid down below. </seg>
<seg id="449"> What makes you think it's a body? I saw it myself when you took it out of the van. Look, all you can accuse me of is manhandling a couple of cops. The rest is hocus-pocus! You have no solid evidence! </seg>
<seg id="450"> No grounds to hold me for murder! </seg>
<seg id="451"> You don't even know the victim's name! </seg>
<seg id="452"> Tomorrow I have a meeting with the Minister of Culture! </seg>
<seg id="453"> You'd better release me, or else... You're about to commit another crime! </seg>
<seg id="454"> I advise you to keep quiet. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Sit. </seg>
<seg id="456"> I'll take your advise and keep quiet. </seg>
<seg id="457"> My dear Onoff, I don't rule out the possibility that I'll fail to prove your guilt. </seg>
<seg id="458"> No.In a way, I hope that's the case. But you won't have any meeting with any Minister till you tell me what you did after dusk. Even at the risk of hearing you spent the whole time parked on the john with a monumental bout of diarrhea! </seg>
<seg id="459"> D'you want me to move the desk, Mr. Inspector? </seg>
<seg id="460"> It'll keep us awake. </seg>
<seg id="461"> We're in for a long night. </seg>
<seg id="462"> Right, get on with it. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Does your ex-second wife remarry? </seg>
<seg id="464"> Does she live with someone? </seg>
<seg id="465"> Does she have a lover? </seg>
<seg id="466"> I'll take your advise and keep quiet. Improbable as it seems, let's suppose neither you nor your ex-second wife knew the area. So she didn't go to the "station", but went to "look for a station". To look for a station nearby, in order to leave. </seg>
<seg id="467"> But in this case how would you get the car back? </seg>
<seg id="468"> I'll take your advise and keep quiet. </seg>
<seg id="469"> Maybe... She went to look for a station with someone else. Someone who afterward went back to your place. Who? </seg>
<seg id="470"> I'll take your advise and keep quiet. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Or simpler still, she never left. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Maybe she stayed with you to keep your company? But in this case, where was she when my men arrested you? </seg>
<seg id="473"> Why were you running so out of breath you couldn't talk? </seg>
<seg id="474"> I'll take your advise and keep quiet. </seg>
<seg id="475"> is that your ex-second wife's number? </seg>
<seg id="476"> I'll take your advise and keep quiet. </seg>
<seg id="477"> You expressly asked to call that number! Then you implied the victim could be a man! To cover your ass. To throw us off course. </seg>
<seg id="478"> Is the victim the woman whose number is 93633396? </seg>
<seg id="479"> If it's not her, how many potential victims does a man have, a man of renown, a recluse, whom no one has seen for several years? </seg>
<seg id="480"> How many know you well enough to know where to find you, here, in the middle of nowhere, where even you say you seldom come? </seg>
<seg id="481"> The list can't be enormous. </seg>
<seg id="482"> A friend? </seg>
<seg id="483"> A mistress? </seg>
<seg id="484"> A relative? </seg>
<seg id="485"> The chauffeur? The secretary? </seg>
<seg id="486"> Your doctor? Your lawyer? </seg>
<seg id="487"> One of your collaborators? </seg>
<seg id="488"> A journalist? </seg>
<seg id="489"> A photographer, chasing a scoop? </seg>
<seg id="490"> A student who's pestered you for years with a series of inane questions? </seg>
<seg id="491"> Your editor? </seg>
<seg id="492"> Which one came to see you yesterday afternoon? </seg>
<seg id="493"> I'll take your advise and keep quiet. </seg>
<seg id="494"> You come from a military family. Your father was a hero in the war. You yourself were an officer. And I'm to believe you've never held a gun? </seg>
<seg id="495"> Go on, take my advice and keep quiet! </seg>
<seg id="496"> That's enough, Onoff! </seg>
<seg id="497"> Stop it, stop it. </seg>
<seg id="498"> We've changed the tune, Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="499"> Nobody plays games with me. </seg>
<seg id="500"> As your biography is world-famous, I know it by heart. </seg>
<seg id="501"> He was born in a ditch, at the edge of a field. </seg>
<seg id="502"> She who borne him severed the cord with her teeth, tied it off and left. </seg>
<seg id="503"> They baptized him Blaise February, because he was found on a freezing night in February, and because it was the feast day of Saint Blaise. </seg>
<seg id="504"> I am Blaise February! </seg>
<seg id="505"> My biography is a lie, </seg>
<seg id="506"> from beginning to end. I wrote it myself. </seg>
<seg id="507"> An old man made up a new name for me, worthy of a writer. The name Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="508"> He was called Faubin. He was my best friend. </seg>
<seg id="509"> It's thanks to him that I became great. </seg>
<seg id="510"> I was never in the army, </seg>
<seg id="511"> never fired a gun. </seg>
<seg id="512"> I grew up in an orphanage. </seg>
<seg id="513"> They gave us milk... every day warm milk, morning and evening. </seg>
<seg id="514"> I detest warm milk. </seg>
<seg id="515"> Paula, get me a cup of coffee, would you? </seg>
<seg id="516"> I've had a nightmare... a terrifying nightmare. </seg>
<seg id="517"> I dreamt I killed my editor, and took back my manuscript. I ran and ran and ran to your place. </seg>
<seg id="518"> But your house had turned into a police station with a strange inspector... He recited all my books by heart. </seg>
<seg id="519"> Paula, get me some paper, I have to write all this down. </seg>
<seg id="520"> Paula... </seg>
<seg id="521"> It's a mess... </seg>
<seg id="522"> I've never seen the inspector like this. </seg>
<seg id="523"> If you ask me, he's stumped. It's a funny situation. Proof, he needs proof. </seg>
<seg id="524"> - The captain says not. - That asshole. </seg>
<seg id="525"> Ignore him. He's basically OK. They're all nice here... </seg>
<seg id="526"> I still have to get used to it, I need time. I never thought... </seg>
<seg id="527"> What time is it? </seg>
<seg id="528"> You slept an hour. </seg>
<seg id="529"> Cold; want to warm yourself? </seg>
<seg id="530"> Can I have some paper? I want to make some notes. </seg>
<seg id="531"> Well... sure. </seg>
<seg id="532"> Give him some hot wine. </seg>
<seg id="533"> - An idea for a new book? - You don't write because you have an idea, but because you can't do anything else. </seg>
<seg id="534"> Shit! </seg>
<seg id="535"> Shit! </seg>
<seg id="536"> - Really, that... - Shut up. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Just shut up. </seg>
<seg id="538"> When I tell people this, nobody'll believe me. </seg>
<seg id="539"> How can a place as absurd as this possibly exist? </seg>
<seg id="540"> True. It's no place for a world traveler like you. </seg>
<seg id="541"> We don't have anything. It's not a big city. Nothing here but the forest. I've had my job here for fifteen years. </seg>
<seg id="542"> I've always liked it fine. Wouldn't catch me in a city, not even dead. </seg>
<seg id="543"> The typewriter. Could I use the typewriter? </seg>
<seg id="544"> It's logical, it's logical, but... - Yes, come on. - ...but you have to ask the Inspector. </seg>
<seg id="545"> Is it possible to kill and not remember? </seg>
<seg id="546"> Remember, to remember... It's so easy to look back, old memories trapped in amber, pain and sorrow tingled with black, everything in amber, everything in amber. We must learn how to forget, A much harder thing to do, we must go on without regret, Wipe clean the slate and start anew. Erase the past and look ahead... </seg>
<seg id="547"> Ever seen this man, Mr. February? </seg>
<seg id="548"> Seems to me I know him. </seg>
<seg id="549"> Who is he? </seg>
<seg id="550"> My math teacher, when I was in high school. </seg>
<seg id="551"> What else? </seg>
<seg id="552"> It's to him I owe my passion to numbers, for symmetry, geometric reasoning. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Professor Trivarchi... </seg>
<seg id="554"> He set forth theorems as if they were fables. </seg>
<seg id="555"> His words didn't go through our ears, they went directly to our minds. </seg>
<seg id="556"> His lessons were sincere and pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="557"> "Two parallel lines can never meet. Nonetheless, it is possible to imagine the existence of a point so far out of space, so far into infinity, that we can admit and acknowledge, that our two lines do in fact meet there. </seg>
<seg id="558"> So it is. </seg>
<seg id="559"> We shall call this point the ideal point". </seg>
<seg id="560"> - Never saw her before. - Are you sure? </seg>
<seg id="561"> Well? Yes... </seg>
<seg id="562"> Yes, I know her. And..? </seg>
<seg id="563"> She's a girl I once loved. </seg>
<seg id="564"> Can you tell me when you saw her last? </seg>
<seg id="565"> One morning I left her sleeping at the hotel. I went to the airport. I didn't even say goodbye. </seg>
<seg id="566"> That was twenty years ago. </seg>
<seg id="567"> Where did you find these pictures? </seg>
<seg id="568"> Figure it out for yourself! I've been looking for them for so long... </seg>
<seg id="569"> Were you looking last night, too? </seg>
<seg id="570"> Yes... Last night, too. </seg>
<seg id="571"> I've been looking high and low for ages and ages, and never found them. Not just these two. There were a whole lot of them... A mountain of pictures. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Why are they so important? </seg>
<seg id="573"> I don't know. They are relics of a strange habit of mine, or, if you prefer, a vice I practiced almost all my life. </seg>
<seg id="574"> I always used to carry a small camera. I collected the faces of everyone I met, everywhere I went. Sort of an unorthodox way of keeping a diary. </seg>
<seg id="575"> A game I gave up, the very day I made up my mind to retire from public life. </seg>
<seg id="576"> After that I mislaid them. </seg>
<seg id="577"> All my friends and all my enemies are in those pictures. The people I love and used to love, those I didn't know how to or didn't want to love. </seg>
<seg id="578"> Those who shook my hand and smiled, and those who looked at me just looked without saying anything. Thousands and thousands and thousands of faces. </seg>
<seg id="579"> Where did you get them? We simply searched your farmhouse. </seg>
<seg id="580"> You obviously didn't look very heartily. </seg>
<seg id="581"> All these faces... </seg>
<seg id="582"> Who is he? </seg>
<seg id="583"> Faubin. </seg>
<seg id="584"> Faubin? </seg>
<seg id="585"> The man who made up the name of Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="586"> A bum! </seg>
<seg id="587"> Yes... </seg>
<seg id="588"> A bum. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Is he the one who's... the one you met yesterday evening? </seg>
<seg id="590"> How could I have! </seg>
<seg id="591"> It's to his memory that I dedicated "The palace..." </seg>
<seg id="592"> Dedicated? </seg>
<seg id="593"> You should know that. You never dedicated a book to anyone. </seg>
<seg id="594"> Everyone knows that. </seg>
<seg id="595"> That... That's impossible. </seg>
<seg id="596"> Impossible? </seg>
<seg id="597"> Please don't stain it. </seg>
<seg id="598"> It... It's impossible! </seg>
<seg id="599"> Maybe you dedicated to him a book that... a book that was never published? An unsubmitted book? </seg>
<seg id="600"> No... </seg>
<seg id="601"> It could only be this one. </seg>
<seg id="602"> Why? Why this one particularly? </seg>
<seg id="603"> Faubin vas a vagrant. </seg>
<seg id="604"> The most intelligent man I ever met. </seg>
<seg id="605"> I never managed to learn anything about his past. </seg>
<seg id="606"> He refused to talk about it. </seg>
<seg id="607"> But I always believed he'd been someone really important. </seg>
<seg id="608"> When my books began to sell, I offered to help him, but he wouldn't give up his hideaways under the bridges. </seg>
<seg id="609"> He was a bit crazy. </seg>
<seg id="610"> He spent his time writing on the backs of old calendars or in notebooks, whatever he could find in garbage cans. </seg>
<seg id="611"> He wrote floods and floods and floods of words that made no sense. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Then one day, I got a letter from him. I opened it. I saw that for the first time, he'd written something intelligible, more than intelligible. Each... each... each phrase reflected the most subtle rules of grammar. </seg>
<seg id="613"> I understood that he was dead. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Yes, but... why say you dedicated a book to him if you didn't do it? </seg>
<seg id="615"> Some time later, I went through a terrible dry spell. </seg>
<seg id="616"> I couldn't write. I couldn't live. </seg>
<seg id="617"> For weeks on end I sat at my desk and found I have nothing to say. </seg>
<seg id="618"> I often thought about that deluge of nonsense, those thousands and thousands of words which were Faubin's gift to me. </seg>
<seg id="619"> I began to read and re-read it all. - Looking for what? - I couldn't believe that before he died he wrote such a touching letter, so perfect... while he'd spent his life rummaging through humanity's garbage, stringing words together without rhyme nor reason. </seg>
<seg id="620"> For three years all I did was work on this gargantuan puzzle. </seg>
<seg id="621"> Right, the press talked about my silence, breakdown. Writer's block, misantropia. But I managed to channel my hunger into a fever of excitement. </seg>
<seg id="622"> A thousand times I took apart this ocean of words, syllable by syllable. And at last I found the solution to the mystery. </seg>
<seg id="623"> It was unbelievably simple. </seg>
<seg id="624"> Faubin didn't write, he merely copied what was already written in his head. </seg>
<seg id="625"> He transcribed the words into 9 notebooks, all at the same time, breaking down sentences the way you break down a number. </seg>
<seg id="626"> It was rare to find two words which made any sense, next to each other, unless it was by accident. </seg>
<seg id="627"> It was extraordinary! </seg>
<seg id="628"> When I'd finally reconstructed his work, it was simply magnificent! </seg>
<seg id="629"> I never would've believed anyone could write something so pure, so... so unique. </seg>
<seg id="630"> I wish I could've read it. </seg>
<seg id="631"> You did. </seg>
<seg id="632"> I published it under the title of "The Palace of Nine Frontiers". "The Palace of Nine Frontiers", signed by me. </seg>
<seg id="633"> It was a phenomenal success after all those years of silence. </seg>
<seg id="634"> But I was finished, and only I new it. </seg>
<seg id="635"> Alcohol became my only joy, and I needed joy every second. </seg>
<seg id="636"> I despise to my soul everything I've written since. </seg>
<seg id="637"> I'll never reach such heights again. </seg>
<seg id="638"> But I'm condemned to write despite everything, because when I write, it's as if I were drinking. </seg>
<seg id="639"> My art is no more than a contemptible drug. </seg>
<seg id="640"> I hate the people who keep pushing me to publish what I write. </seg>
<seg id="641"> What I write solely to keep from drinking. </seg>
<seg id="642"> Who is pushing you to publish? </seg>
<seg id="643"> My editor, for one. </seg>
<seg id="644"> When was the last time you saw him? I don't remember. </seg>
<seg id="645"> Yesterday? </seg>
<seg id="646"> You think I killed him? Did he visit you at your house on the Choron? </seg>
<seg id="647"> I don't remember. What did you do yesterday, after you looked for the pictures? </seg>
<seg id="648"> I don't know. I kept on looking... Looking for this? Yes. </seg>
<seg id="649"> Where did you go after that? </seg>
<seg id="650"> After that... I set down and stared... Haven't you ever stared out of the window for hours and hours, without seeing anything? </seg>
<seg id="651"> Then? </seg>
<seg id="652"> Paula came. </seg>
<seg id="653"> Paula? </seg>
<seg id="654"> Up to now, you've said you were with Danielle February! </seg>
<seg id="655"> Only Paula came to the farmhouse. </seg>
<seg id="656"> I never see Danielle. Who's Paula? </seg>
<seg id="657"> Who's Paula? </seg>
<seg id="658"> Who's Paula? </seg>
<seg id="659"> She's everything... </seg>
<seg id="660"> Why wouldn't you talk about her before? </seg>
<seg id="661"> Because you always feel great embarrassment at being loved. </seg>
<seg id="662"> Paula. </seg>
<seg id="663"> So... Paula came to the farmhouse with you. </seg>
<seg id="664"> She stayed a few days, then left. </seg>
<seg id="665"> Maybe even yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="666"> Then she came back, in the afternoon. Right? </seg>
<seg id="667"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="668"> Why'd she come back so soon? What happened? </seg>
<seg id="669"> I don't want to go back home. </seg>
<seg id="670"> She wants to take you home? </seg>
<seg id="671"> Why does Paula to take you away? </seg>
<seg id="672"> I want to be alone. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Go with them. Go with Stephane... </seg>
<seg id="674"> Who's with Paula? </seg>
<seg id="675"> Friends. Insufferable friends. </seg>
<seg id="676"> Stephane? </seg>
<seg id="677"> Who's Stephane, your editor? </seg>
<seg id="678"> Go on. Go, I'll join you tonight. </seg>
<seg id="679"> Why do you want to be alone? </seg>
<seg id="680"> You cut your hair? </seg>
<seg id="681"> Yes. Why? </seg>
<seg id="682"> Why did you shave off your beard? </seg>
<seg id="683"> I want to look... to look at myself. </seg>
<seg id="684"> You want to see yourself as you haven't seen yourself in years. </seg>
<seg id="685"> Then? What happened then? </seg>
<seg id="686"> I can't find the words. </seg>
<seg id="687"> I don't know what to say. </seg>
<seg id="688"> You tried to write something? </seg>
<seg id="689"> You wrote this. </seg>
<seg id="690"> "I have nothing to say that can be said. </seg>
<seg id="691"> I would've preferred silence, my faithful friend. Elegant, flawless, suitable for every occasion. But for all that I've been able to live in isolation of the most absolute kind. I now feel an absolute desire to say thank you, to apologize and give some explanations, a sign, though I don't know what. Forget me often. Forget... Onoff." </seg>
<seg id="692"> The only one you didn't recognize. </seg>
<seg id="693"> Faubin took it. </seg>
<seg id="694"> I think... I think I was five. </seg>
<seg id="695"> I gave you my word. </seg>
<seg id="696"> If you still want to call... </seg>
<seg id="697"> Hello? Paula, it's me. It's me, Paula. Me, Onoff. Do you hear me? - There is nobody there - I have to talk to you. To tell you so many... Listen, please listen to me! Hello? It's me, Onoff. I have to tell you something important, you hear? - You hear? - Hello? Forgive me, Paula. - Anybody there? - I am sorry, I've done something... something terrible. Why can't you hear me! </seg>
<seg id="698"> Tell the Minister not to expect me. </seg>
<seg id="699"> Drink this, it'll do you good. </seg>
<seg id="700"> Go on. </seg>
<seg id="701"> - Is it milk? - Yes. </seg>
<seg id="702"> Warm milk. Drink it. </seg>
<seg id="703"> He doesn't know yet? You didn't know, either. Neither did I, They didn't either, or the Inspector. Nobody knows when they first come here. </seg>
<seg id="704"> Going to be a nice day. </seg>
<seg id="705"> A good sign, Mr. Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="706"> Can I ask you something? Of course. </seg>
<seg id="707"> Can I take my pictures with me? </seg>
<seg id="708"> We don't have the right to do this, because whatever I take away must be put back exactly as it was. </seg>
<seg id="709"> But who's going to miss a few photographs you yourself mislaid? </seg>
<seg id="710"> In my office... on the table... - Above the left-hand drawer... - Your manuscript? The manuscript of my new novel. Did you take it? </seg>
<seg id="711"> No. </seg>
<seg id="712"> Too bad... But I read a few pages. It's good, It's sufficient just to have a look to say it's extraordinary. It's really very, very good, superb. </seg>
<seg id="713"> I think it's your best work, better than the others you wrote. Better than the one you didn't write, as well. </seg>
<seg id="714"> It's going to be a huge success. </seg>
<seg id="715"> Excellent... Have a nice trip. </seg>
<seg id="716"> Have a nice trip, Mr. Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="717"> Thank you, Mr. Inspector. </seg>
<seg id="718"> By the way, what's your name? </seg>
<seg id="719"> Call me Leonardo Da Vinci. </seg>
<seg id="720"> Thanks, Mr. Leonardo Da Vinci. </seg>
<seg id="721"> You are in a good job. Difficult, but... </seg>

<seg id="8"> Well ', listen... THUNDER </seg>
<seg id="9"> (Marie-Cécile) Why do you say that? Turn to some agent. </seg>
<seg id="10"> These actresses, young and brave. - Yes  I can handle it. </seg>
<seg id="11"> At that time a woman was married at Vanda's age... </seg>
<seg id="12"> .. had five children and had come down with tuberculosis. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Instead today all girls talk like they're ten years old... </seg>
<seg id="14"> .. and have breathed helium: "Too, too cool!" </seg>
<seg id="15"> "It's one thing that rocks!" </seg>
<seg id="16"> I have a parade of more than thirty bitches... </seg>
<seg id="17"> ..Half dressed as bitches and the other half as lesbians. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Vanda or I would be better than most of those girls. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Just put on a dress and a pair of socks you're done. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Hello? Hello, darling? </seg>
<seg id="21"> Oh, damn... Hello? </seg>
<seg id="22"> - Fuck! (Vanda) Knock, knock. </seg>

<seg id="24"> Holy shit! - If you are coming for "Venus in Fur"... </seg>
<seg id="25"> .. everyone left half an hour ago. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I'm sorry, but I was on the other side of Paris. </seg>
<seg id="27"> My phone was charging, I broke a heel... </seg>
<seg id="28"> .. on one of those ventilation grilles that no one knows where they are. </seg>
<seg id="29"> And then there was a guy on the subway who rubbed himself on me... </seg>
<seg id="30"> .. Everything's this way. </seg>
<seg id="31"> And finally, the storm came. I'm soaked to the bone! </seg>
<seg id="32"> Holy cow, it's my day. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Holy shit bitch! </seg>
<seg id="34"> Maybe there's a Valium in the medicine cabinet, want to look? </seg>
<seg id="35"> No, it's just my luck. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Thank you, Lord, for making my life easier. </seg>
<seg id="37"> By the way, let me introduce myself. </seg>
<seg id="38"> - Vanda Jourdain. - Who? Vanda? </seg>
<seg id="39"> Do you understand? </seg>
<seg id="40"> I even have the right name. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Do you know a lot of girls who call themselves "Vanda"? </seg>
<seg id="42"> I was made for that part... </seg>
<seg id="43"> .. and she takes the subway stop in the tunnel with the turn. </seg>
<seg id="44"> - And your name is? - Thomas Novachek. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Pleasure... Hey, wait a minute! </seg>
<seg id="46"> - You are the author. - Yes, well... no. </seg>
<seg id="47"> I did the script. </seg>
<seg id="48"> - Yes, but you are also the director, right? - Yes, I would say yes. </seg>
<seg id="49"> I love your work at least the ones I know. </seg>
<seg id="50"> "Anatomy of a shadow," great! I saw it twice! </seg>
<seg id="51"> Not me. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Oh! But that was stupid. </seg>
<seg id="53"> - I meant that other one. - What other? - What a shame. </seg>
<seg id="54"> However, this one is too radical, at least from what I've read. </seg>
<seg id="55"> And rather risqué, right? Sexy in my opinion. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Or erotic, kind if you like humiliation and stuff like that. </seg>
<seg id="57"> I do not usually go around dressed in leather wearing a dog collar... </seg>
<seg id="58"> .. I'm a reserved type. </seg>
<seg id="59"> But I thought that I would help me get into the part. </seg>
<seg id="60"> - It's S & M stuff? - Not exactly. </seg>
<seg id="61"> - It's set in 1870. - Ah, I see. </seg>
<seg id="62"> - Not much of this in 1870, right? - No, not really. </seg>
<seg id="63"> - Perhaps the sadomasochistic ones dressed like this. - Yeah, I'll go find out. </seg>
<seg id="64"> - I brought a photo and a resume. - Very well, thank you. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Where are they? Here... </seg>
<seg id="66"> - Here's the picture... and the script. - Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="67"> True, it's a bit short but I was made for this part. </seg>
<seg id="68"> I starred in Hedda Gabbler and they said I was fabulous. </seg>
<seg id="69"> - The Theatre of the urinal? - Yes </seg>
<seg id="70"> I have not had the pleasure of following their last season. </seg>
<seg id="71"> You had an appointment for this audition? </seg>
<seg id="72"> At 2 pm or 3... a little 'time ago. </seg>
<seg id="73"> - Vanda... what did you say? - Jourdain? </seg>
<seg id="74"> Everyone always asks me if it's a stage name. </seg>
<seg id="75"> I don't see your name here. </seg>
<seg id="76"> Really? My agent swore that it was all right. </seg>
<seg id="77"> - I'm not on the list? - Please, leave. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Fuck! Well, thanks, sir. </seg>
<seg id="79"> - But since I'm here... - Wait, what does? </seg>
<seg id="80"> I also know the scene! </seg>
<seg id="81"> - No! - Wait! </seg>
<seg id="82"> - I even have a costume. - It's useless. </seg>
<seg id="83"> - You don't want me to audition? - I do not want to do it. No! </seg>
<seg id="84"> - Since I'm here we might try. - They're all gone. </seg>
<seg id="85"> - There is no one to run your lines. - You can do it. </seg>
<seg id="86"> For me it would be an honor to have the author do the scene with me. </seg>
<seg id="87"> - The author. - Fantastic! </seg>
<seg id="88"> - Directly from the author. - Okay, stop! </seg>
<seg id="89"> - To tell the truth, Miss... - Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="90"> - Try something different. - Oh yeah? </seg>
<seg id="91"> - Who do you want? - Someone a bit more... </seg>
<seg id="92"> .. how to say... </seg>
<seg id="93"> Okay, don't try so hard. Someone who is not me. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Too short, too tall, too old, too young... </seg>
<seg id="95"> My resume is too short, okay I understand. </seg>
<seg id="96"> - But no, wait. - I've pissed you off. </seg>
<seg id="97"> - Calm down. - It's not fair. </seg>
<seg id="98"> Really, I've had enough. </seg>
<seg id="99"> My day was a nightmare. </seg>
<seg id="100"> You can arrange other auditions. </seg>
<seg id="101"> I'm here now, I'd avoid having to come back tomorrow. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Even my day was very stressful too. </seg>
<seg id="103"> I auditioned an army of failures. </seg>
<seg id="104"> One even had braces on her teeth. </seg>
<seg id="105"> - Now would not be the time. - Okay. - I need to rest. </seg>
<seg id="106"> - Then I'll have some for dinner. - Yes, I understand. </seg>
<seg id="107"> It will be better to do it when I'm less tired. </seg>
<seg id="108"> Thank you for coming and congratulations on the dress. </seg>
<seg id="109"> - I'll see you soon. - I wish it were so, but it's nice to say it. </seg>
<seg id="110"> You look like a decent person. </seg>
<seg id="111"> This is a shitty job... </seg>
<seg id="112"> .. not to mention the thirty euros for this shitty costume. </seg>
<seg id="113"> - Do not you find this face "1800 something"? - Of course! </seg>
<seg id="114"> - It is very Vanda, right? - Very lovely. </seg>
<seg id="115"> I think wearing a dress this long... </seg>
<seg id="116"> .. because at that time everyone hated asses. </seg>
<seg id="117"> - This is a misstatement. - I see how it is. </seg>
<seg id="118"> CELLPHONE RINGS Please, be nice! </seg>
<seg id="119"> - Yes? - Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="120"> Oh, I must have lost track of the time. </seg>
<seg id="121"> No, no! </seg>
<seg id="122"> I am not speaking to you, someone has just came in. </seg>
<seg id="123"> No, No. I don't know. </seg>
<seg id="124"> Then I'll take the sushi just get takeout. </seg>
<seg id="125"> Hello. </seg>
<seg id="126"> Can you help me close it? </seg>
<seg id="127"> Thomas Novachek in person will give me the lines. </seg>
<seg id="128"> It won't be much help, I'm not an actor. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Come on, you're perfect. You'll crush Kowalski. </seg>
<seg id="130"> - No, Kushemski. - Kushemski. </seg>
<seg id="131"> - You are Kushemski. - OK, all done. </seg>
<seg id="132"> At your service, sir. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Where do we start? You choose. I don't care.. </seg>
<seg id="134"> Let's try the first scene. </seg>
<seg id="135"> Okay. </seg>
<seg id="136"> - It has its fair share? - Yes </seg>
<seg id="137"> - It's a bit the worse for wear. - Is that the full text? </seg>
<seg id="138"> - Who gave it to you? - I don't know. </seg>
<seg id="139"> - I got it from my agent. - And where did he get it? </seg>
<seg id="140"> Is this a problem? Is it top secret? Should not I see it? </seg>
<seg id="141"> It's not important. </seg>
<seg id="142"> - Have you read it? - Yes, in passing, on the subway. </seg>
<seg id="143"> I have seen that is adapted from something. </seg>
<seg id="144"> From a song by Lou Reed "Venus in furs?" </seg>
<seg id="145"> No, it is taken from a novel by an Austrian author </seg>
<seg id="146"> "The Venus in Fur" by Leopold von Sacher Masoch. </seg>
<seg id="147"> I bet you know how to read Austrian and have read it in the original version. </seg>
<seg id="148"> Actually yes. </seg>
<seg id="149"> The book caused a scandal when it was published in 1870. </seg>
<seg id="150"> I believe it! It's a porn BDSM. </seg>
<seg id="151"> - This is not a porn BDSM. - You don't think it's porn? </seg>
<seg id="152"> Not even a little? </seg>
<seg id="153"> Since it was written in the Middle Ages, in 1800 or something? </seg>
<seg id="154"> "Venus in Fur" is a beautiful love story... </seg>
<seg id="155"> It's a masterpiece. It's one of the great texts of world literature. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Ah, yes? For me, it's a porno. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Sadomasochism, I know what it is, I work in the theater. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The term "masochism" comes from Sacher-Masoch and from this book. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Ah! Masochism-Masoch. I get it! </seg>
<seg id="160"> So this guy has given his name to sadomasochism. </seg>
<seg id="161"> - It was not his intention. - I see. </seg>
<seg id="162"> He believed he had written a good novel and they all said it was porn. </seg>
<seg id="163"> - You have plagiarized the book? - No, I adapted it. </seg>
<seg id="164"> I reinvented the dialogue, the situations and... </seg>
<seg id="165"> - There is so much of me in here. - Great! </seg>
<seg id="166"> Genius! Where does it take place? </seg>
<seg id="167"> In a hotel that is located on a remote mountain in the eastern part of... </seg>
<seg id="168"> .. the Imperial Austro-Hungarian Empire. - Let me remember. </seg>
<seg id="169"> - It's complicated. - It's a nice place? </seg>
<seg id="170"> Yes, it is a spa for wealthy people... </seg>
<seg id="171"> .. a luxurious place. </seg>
<seg id="172"> The curtain rises and Kushemski is in his room. </seg>
<seg id="173"> He is reading his book while drinking coffee. </seg>
<seg id="174"> And then... knock knock! Cue Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="175"> It is symbolic from the point of view of the character? </seg>
<seg id="176"> No, but there are still people who read the book. </seg>
<seg id="177"> - Sometimes even the real book, on paper. - Ah, you caught me. </seg>
<seg id="178"> This fellow, what's his name? Sevran, Severan, Savrìne .. </seg>
<seg id="179"> - Severin Von Kushemski. - That's it. </seg>
<seg id="180"> What kind of person is he? </seg>
<seg id="181"> Tell me some adjectives. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Rich, idle, typical of his era, smart traveler, cultured. </seg>
<seg id="183"> - An intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="184"> - So to speak. - Ah, "so to speak." I love it. </seg>
<seg id="185"> - I haven't heard anyone talk like that in a long time. - I wouldn't know. </seg>
<seg id="186"> - So she is a distinct type? - You want me to talk about the character? </seg>
<seg id="187"> Yes, I know it by heart... but yes, please, if you like! </seg>
<seg id="188"> I would say that from many points of view she is a young woman of her time... </seg>
<seg id="189"> .. in spite of the principles she professes, but... </seg>
<seg id="190"> - In spite of what? Of the principles she professes. </seg>
<seg id="191"> At first glance she is a person in place, poised and very cultured. </seg>
<seg id="192"> As you say! Anything else? </seg>
<seg id="193"> Something that I do not already know? </seg>
<seg id="194"> Never mind, I'll manage. </seg>
<seg id="195"> - Will it bother you if I change lighting? - The lighting! </seg>
<seg id="196"> It's a bit' too much, don't you think? </seg>
<seg id="197"> Please, make yourself at home. </seg>
<seg id="198"> Is that better? </seg>
<seg id="199"> Not bad. </seg>
<seg id="200"> Wait. </seg>
<seg id="201"> I don't know how to work that. </seg>
<seg id="202"> OK. That's much better. </seg>
<seg id="203"> I guess this is the sofa. </seg>
<seg id="204"> Yes, it's the sofa. </seg>
<seg id="205"> A desk? </seg>
<seg id="206"> The book that is discussed? </seg>
<seg id="207"> There is a postcard, fantastic! </seg>
<seg id="208"> What is this? </seg>
<seg id="209"> - A phallic symbol? - There are remnants of the previous show. </seg>
<seg id="210"> A Belgian production of... </seg>

<seg id="223"> "The Lord Almighty struck him and put him in the hands of a woman." </seg>
<seg id="224"> Is a quote that appears in the novel, It's taken from the Book of Judith. </seg>
<seg id="225"> It's in the Bible? - In the Apocryphal books of the Bible, yes. </seg>
<seg id="226"> I do not know anything about that. </seg>
<seg id="227"> - Ah, yes. Don't you think it's sexist? </seg>
<seg id="228"> "The Lord Almighty struck him and put him in the hands of a woman." </seg>
<seg id="229"> I just mentioned the novel of Sacher-Masoch. </seg>
<seg id="230"> Yes, but since you put it on page zero... </seg>
<seg id="231"> It does not matter, does not concern me, I'm just an actress. But you... </seg>
<seg id="232"> Forgot the fur! </seg>
<seg id="233"> - She's wearing a stole, right? - Yes, indeed. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Fur, fur... </seg>
<seg id="235"> soft fur... </seg>

<seg id="248"> My name is Vanda von Dunayev. </seg>
<seg id="249"> I am in the room above you. </seg>
<seg id="250"> Last night I found this book, a copy of "Faust"... </seg>
<seg id="251"> .. with your bookmark inside. </seg>
<seg id="252"> I was sitting under the birches, near the statue of Venus. </seg>
<seg id="253"> Thank you very much. </seg>
<seg id="254"> I had just asked the waitress to look for it.. </seg>
<seg id="255"> I found it and there is a postcard inside. </seg>
<seg id="256"> This is a Titian, right? </seg>
<seg id="257"> Yes </seg>
<seg id="258"> "Venus in the mirror," one of my favorite paintings. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Your Venus looks to be well used... </seg>
<seg id="260"> .. just like your book. </seg>
<seg id="261"> She is faithful? </seg>
<seg id="262"> - Excuse me? - Original? </seg>
<seg id="263"> Yes, it is a copy... faithful to the original. </seg>
<seg id="264"> I understand your infatuation, it's a ravishing picture. </seg>
<seg id="265"> Thanks for having troubled to bring it back. </seg>
<seg id="266"> I could not help noticing the strange poem written on the back. </seg>
<seg id="267"> "Venus In Fur". Did you write it? </seg>
<seg id="268"> - Those are poor, poor verses. - Shoddy? really? </seg>
<seg id="269"> "To love and be loved, or as a charm..." </seg>
<seg id="270"> ".. yet, stronger, more beautiful still .." </seg>
<seg id="271"> ".. is this torment that consumes me." </seg>

<seg id="279"> I appreciate your discretion. </seg>
<seg id="280"> Want to sit for a moment? </seg>
<seg id="281"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="282"> - May I take your coat? - Very kind of you. </seg>
<seg id="283"> This fur is a tartar, right? </seg>
<seg id="284"> A sable of the Caucasus? I would say of Kazakhstan. </seg>
<seg id="285"> Yes, a tartar sable from Kazakhistan, exactly. </seg>
<seg id="286"> Kushemski, standing, observes the fur between his hands. </seg>
<seg id="287"> But you are trembling Kushemski. </seg>
<seg id="288"> Yes, I pray you to forgive me. </seg>
<seg id="289"> - Can I get you something to drink? - Gladly. </seg>
<seg id="290"> - A coffee would be perfect. - Then take mine. </seg>

<seg id="293"> I hope the noise above doesn't bother you when I walk in heels. </seg>
<seg id="294"> I'd give anything in the world. </seg>
<seg id="295"> To hear you walk so well in your heels. </seg>
<seg id="296"> So you're a poet, Herr Kuskhemski? </seg>
<seg id="297"> A waste of time. </seg>
<seg id="298"> And a passionate expert on fur? </seg>
<seg id="299"> The love of fur... </seg>
<seg id="300"> - Skip this measure, the following is ... - No, read it. </seg>
<seg id="301"> The love of fur is innate. </seg>
<seg id="302"> a passion given to all by nature. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Put in a little more effort. </seg>
<seg id="304"> The love of fur is innate. </seg>
<seg id="305"> a passion given to all by nature. </seg>
<seg id="306"> Caress a soft and thick fur... </seg>
<seg id="307"> .. hear that particular crackle, that electricity... </seg>
<seg id="308"> I think that it is not only a gift of nature. </seg>
<seg id="309"> Your mother wrapped you up in a sable when you were little? </seg>
<seg id="310"> But that's indiscreet. </seg>
<seg id="311"> I beg your pardon. - No, I... </seg>
<seg id="312"> It was one of my aunts who had a real passion for fur. </seg>
<seg id="313"> - So that explains it. - We are all easily explained. </seg>
<seg id="314"> - But we remain intractable. - Inextricable? </seg>
<seg id="315"> - What do you mean? - Life makes us what we are? </seg>
<seg id="316"> End of page three. </seg>
<seg id="317"> THUNDER </seg>
<seg id="318"> Actually yes... </seg>
<seg id="319"> - That was going very well, Vanda. - I was looking for footholds. </seg>
<seg id="320"> - I did what I could. - Seemed very solid. </seg>
<seg id="321"> That's what it means to be able to create an atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="322"> - I am a professional. - Really, it was... </seg>
<seg id="323"> - Stop it, I'll blush. - I did not say it was perfect. </seg>
<seg id="324"> - No, of course. - Let's go on a little more. </seg>
<seg id="325"> Kushemski - After that he makes his big speech... </seg>
<seg id="326"> .. you go to... </seg>
<seg id="327"> - Read, it helps me to get into character. Please recite. </seg>
<seg id="328"> - You read well, Thomas. - No, it's an impression. </seg>
<seg id="329"> You read really well. </seg>
<seg id="330"> - Have you already thought of someone for Kushemski? - Not really. </seg>
<seg id="331"> - I have several options. - You could do it yourself. </seg>
<seg id="332"> - Yes, of course! - I think so seriously. </seg>
<seg id="333"> - You would be very good. - No, it's quite difficult. </seg>
<seg id="334"> - Does the director inflict this on all the actors? - It is his job. </seg>
<seg id="335"> - I'm directing for the first time. - Doesn't look like it. </seg>
<seg id="336"> I decided to do this because directors never understand anything. </seg>
<seg id="337"> - You have no idea what I have endured... - That's why it's perfect. </seg>
<seg id="338"> - You know what to do. - I have everything in my head. </seg>
<seg id="339"> I want to use the "Lyric Suite" by Alban Berg for the transitions... </seg>
<seg id="340"> - a great idea! - He knows the "Lyric Suite"? </seg>
<seg id="341"> No, but you understand what I mean? </seg>
<seg id="342"> You know the story of the inner life, of the characters, everything! - Yes. </seg>
<seg id="343"> What accent Kushemski should have... </seg>
<seg id="344"> .. or something of the kind. - He's a distinguished man. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Yes, distinguished - And with that, I don't know... </seg>
<seg id="346"> .. an aristocrat. </seg>
<seg id="347"> he moves like this... </seg>
<seg id="348"> Or is that just stupid? </seg>
<seg id="349"> a little. It's silly but it is fantastic. </seg>
<seg id="350"> - For this scene he would wear a dressing gown? - Yes </seg>
<seg id="351"> - You're joking! - Want to try it? </seg>
<seg id="352"> Buck up, I'll help. </seg>
<seg id="353"> But it is magnificent. </seg>
<seg id="354"> - Am I wrong or is it vintage? - So I'm told. </seg>
<seg id="355"> Siegfried Mueller... </seg>
<seg id="356"> .. Vienna... </seg>
<seg id="357"> .. 1869. </seg>
<seg id="358"> I hadn't seen that. </seg>
<seg id="360"> Seems tailor-made for him. </seg>
<seg id="361"> - How does it look? - Very good. </seg>
<seg id="362"> It is close to my size. </seg>
<seg id="363"> - You look great. - Yes </seg>
<seg id="364"> Hello, sweet guy. </seg>
<seg id="365"> And the dog collar? </seg>
<seg id="366"> It is a reminder of the period in which I beat the pavement. </seg>
<seg id="367"> Joke! </seg>
<seg id="368"> Let's pick up a few lines back. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Your mother wrapped you up in a sable when you were a little baby? </seg>
<seg id="370"> That was indiscreet, please forgive me. </seg>
<seg id="371"> It was one of my aunts who had a real passion for fur. </seg>
<seg id="372"> - For him it is tough to say this. - Yes, it's no wonder. </seg>
<seg id="373"> - Then take courage. - Yes </seg>
<seg id="374"> That was indiscreet, please forgive me. </seg>
<seg id="375"> It was one of my aunts who had a real passion for fur. </seg>
<seg id="376"> - So that explains it. - We are all easily explained. </seg>
<seg id="377"> But we remain inexplainable. </seg>
<seg id="378"> Inexplainable? </seg>
<seg id="379"> What do you mean? </seg>
<seg id="380"> Life makes us what we are in an unpredictable moment. </seg>
<seg id="381"> Is the coffee to your liking? </seg>
<seg id="382"> I just tasted it. It's excellent. </seg>
<seg id="383"> This is symbolic, right? The coffee is... </seg>
<seg id="384"> .. and she has just tasted but is already excited. </seg>
<seg id="385"> Ln fact, I was suprised. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Have you ever experienced such a surprising moment Mister Kushemski? </seg>
<seg id="387"> In reality, yes, but I will not bother you. </seg>
<seg id="388"> On the contrary, it fascinates me. </seg>
<seg id="389"> Like one of those English detective novels </seg>
<seg id="390"> He had a mysterious aunt who loved fur. </seg>
<seg id="391"> - We could skip this part. - No, read it. I want to hear it. </seg>
<seg id="392"> He had a mysterious aunt who loved fur. </seg>
<seg id="393"> I was a child from hell... </seg>
<seg id="394"> .. spoiled and cruel. </seg>
<seg id="395"> Mean to our maids and our cat. </seg>
<seg id="396"> I behaved very badly with one of my aunts. </seg>
<seg id="397"> The Countess was a woman majestic, voluptuous and terrible .. </seg>
<seg id="398"> - What is it? - Nothing. </seg>
<seg id="399"> just saying aloud the words that I wrote ... </seg>
<seg id="400"> .. two in the morning on a screen looked different. </seg>
<seg id="401"> You're doing great! </seg>
<seg id="402"> What did your aunt do? </seg>
<seg id="403"> One evening he is avenged. </seg>
<seg id="404"> She came into my room... </seg>
<seg id="405"> .. with her big black Russian fox coat </seg>
<seg id="406"> In her hand she held a rod, a branch of birch... </seg>
<seg id="407"> .. With her were the cook and the maid. </seg>
<seg id="408"> She took off her coat and she rolled up his sleeves... </seg>
<seg id="409"> .. I tried to escape... </seg>
<seg id="410"> .. but the other two women took hold of me,.. </seg>
<seg id="411"> I lowered my pants and she threw me on the fur. </seg>
<seg id="412"> I held still while my aunt punished me with the rod. </seg>
<seg id="413"> My buttocks and my naked thighs were on fire. </seg>
<seg id="414"> The maid encouraged her. </seg>
<seg id="415"> She made fun of me, treated me like a sissy </seg>
<seg id="416"> I danced away but my aunt continued to hit me... </seg>
<seg id="417"> .. until such time as I begged her to stop... </seg>
<seg id="418"> .. out of pity. </seg>
<seg id="419"> When she finally stopped, she forced me to thank her... </seg>
<seg id="420"> .. and kiss her feet. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Then she left room threatening to come back. </seg>
<seg id="422"> And all this in the presence of the maids... </seg>
<seg id="423"> .. and our cat. </seg>
<seg id="424"> From that moment... </seg>
<seg id="425"> .. fur to me more than simple fur... </seg>
<seg id="426"> .. nor a birch branch a simple branch. </seg>
<seg id="427"> In a moment she made me who I am... </seg>
<seg id="428"> - And she came back? - Yes </seg>
<seg id="429"> In my dreams, with her black fur and her rod. </seg>
<seg id="430"> She comes to visit me again, night after night. </seg>
<seg id="431"> - My poor friend. Poor? </seg>
<seg id="432"> She taught me the most valuable thing in the world </seg>
<seg id="433"> - And what did she teach you? - That nothing is more sensual than pain. </seg>
<seg id="434"> That nothing is more exciting than degradation. </seg>
<seg id="435"> The Countess did her job well. </seg>
<seg id="436"> It has become my ideal. </seg>
<seg id="437"> From that day I seek her double. </seg>
<seg id="438"> And when I meet this woman I will marry her. </seg>
<seg id="439"> This step is sensational! </seg>
<seg id="440"> Thanks, it took a lot of work. </seg>
<seg id="441"> In practical terms, it's like a play child abuse? </seg>
<seg id="442"> It has nothing to do with it. </seg>
<seg id="443"> What the fuck does the maltreatment of children have to do with this story? </seg>
<seg id="444"> Holy cow, this craze nowadays... </seg>
<seg id="445"> .. bring everything to a social problem of cock. </seg>
<seg id="446"> - The abuse is not only... - Do not follow stereotypes! </seg>
<seg id="447"> Do not talk about anthropology or sociology! </seg>
<seg id="448"> - Let's make theater. - Yes, but... </seg>
<seg id="449"> Here there is much more at stake than the issue of corporal punishment. </seg>
<seg id="450"> Okay, I'm sorry! </seg>
<seg id="451"> Most of the world live impoverished and dull lives! </seg>
<seg id="452"> Why do we always try to bring everything to something else? </seg>
<seg id="453"> What else will we pull out now? sexism, racism, class struggle? </seg>
<seg id="454"> Well, you're certainly unique, Herr Kushemski. </seg>
<seg id="455"> If I were you, I would be careful. </seg>
<seg id="456"> Your ideal woman could prove more cruel than desired. </seg>
<seg id="457"> I am ready to take the risk. </seg>
<seg id="458"> I know what she is... A supersensual person. </seg>
<seg id="459"> An ascetic of pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="460"> And you, Frau von Vanda Dunayev, who or what are you? </seg>
<seg id="461"> I am a pagan. </seg>
<seg id="462"> Does that mean I'm young, beautiful, rich... </seg>
<seg id="463"> .. and by that account able to derive more benefits than possible to others. </seg>
<seg id="464"> I do not deny anything. </seg>
<seg id="465"> I have the utmost respect for your principles. </seg>
<seg id="466"> I beg your pardon, but I do not care for your respect. </seg>
<seg id="467"> I shall love the man in whom I take delight... </seg>
<seg id="468"> .. and take pleasure from the man who will make me happy... </seg>
<seg id="469"> .. but only until he ceases to make me happy and then I'll find another. </seg>
<seg id="470"> For a man there is no greater cruelty than the infidelity of a woman. </seg>
<seg id="471"> For a woman, it gets worse: forced loyalty. </seg>
<seg id="472"> - I can move? - Yes, yes... go ahead, move. </seg>
<seg id="473"> In our society... </seg>
<seg id="474"> woman can have power except through the intercession of a man. </seg>
<seg id="475"> What will become of the woman, when she becomes equal to men? </seg>
<seg id="476"> When she becomes herself? </seg>
<seg id="477"> The Little Vanda is way ahead of her time! </seg>
<seg id="478"> How do you know all the lines? </seg>
<seg id="479"> - I don't know. I learn quickly. - You know all the text by heart! </seg>
<seg id="480"> You had said that Vanda is very much in place in spite of what? </seg>
<seg id="481"> - Of the principles she professes. - There are those. - Yes </seg>
<seg id="482"> According to her Vanda does not believe in all these stories. </seg>
<seg id="483"> 'what it says... Women's Rights, blah blah blah... </seg>
<seg id="484"> But she does, jerk7, She has character, a mind of her own. </seg>
<seg id="485"> As said: " the principles she professes" and not "her principles." </seg>
<seg id="486"> I think I very much liked the alliteration: "of the principles she professes." </seg>
<seg id="487"> I see! </seg>
<seg id="488"> He sold his soul for alliteration. </seg>
<seg id="489"> 'true, I plead guilty. </seg>
<seg id="490"> Just between us, Thomas, she is a true tomboy. </seg>
<seg id="491"> If you allow, I would say that... </seg>
<seg id="492"> You are better than a pagan. Seems to me you are a goddess. </seg>
<seg id="493"> - Really? And what? - Venus. </seg>
<seg id="494"> And Vanda? Is Venus really me or am I making this up? </seg>
<seg id="495"> Venus took the likeness of a human to come to haunt him? </seg>
<seg id="496"> Not really. </seg>
<seg id="497"> - Or rather, not exactly. - Okay, it's so, and she wanted it. </seg>
<seg id="498"> - She wants it to be ambivalent. - Ambiguous. - Yes, that one. </seg>
<seg id="499"> In fact it is the story of "The Bacchae." </seg>
<seg id="500"> Exactly. What was "The Bacchae"? </seg>
<seg id="501"> - It's an old play, right? - It's a very old play. </seg>
<seg id="502"> "Citizens of Corinth. I stand before you a Testiculus... </seg>
<seg id="503"> .. a poor mortal cursed by the gods for his offenses... </seg>
<seg id="504"> .. and totally fucked up till the end of time." </seg>
<seg id="505"> - It's this kind of play? - Yes </seg>
<seg id="506"> Dionysus descends to Earth and is the arrogant king of Thebes... </seg>
<seg id="507"> A quivering jelly dressed as a woman. - It looks exciting. </seg>
<seg id="508"> After that, the wild women of Thebes The Bacchae, broke him in pieces. </seg>
<seg id="509"> - And Dionysus returns to his home, triumphant. - I think I saw it. </seg>
<seg id="510"> In our case, however, it is not Dionysus but Aphrodite. </seg>
<seg id="511"> Of course. Who is that? </seg>
<seg id="512"> - She is the Greek version of Venus. - But it is the same person. </seg>
<seg id="513"> The same goddess. - Hail Aphrodite! </seg>
<seg id="514"> Hail, oh Aphrodite. Am I unbearably pedantic? </seg>
<seg id="515"> Yes, but I find it cute. </seg>
<seg id="516"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="517"> What do we do? </seg>
<seg id="518"> Seems to me a goddess... </seg>
<seg id="519"> Really? What? </seg>
<seg id="520"> Venus. </seg>
<seg id="521"> But Venus can rule only in a world of slaves. </seg>
<seg id="522"> Then I'd better find one. </seg>
<seg id="523"> Would you like to be my slave, Kushemski Herr Doktor? </seg>
<seg id="524"> I already am. </seg>
<seg id="525"> I became your slave the moment you entered this room. </seg>
<seg id="526"> Really? Are you already in love with me? </seg>
<seg id="527"> Deeply. </seg>
<seg id="528"> I am suffering as if I knew it all along. </seg>
<seg id="529"> - Submit to me. - Stand up straight and turn away from me. </seg>
<seg id="530"> I must confess this intrigues me. </seg>
<seg id="531"> I love your frankness and the clarity of your thought. </seg>
<seg id="532"> From a physical point of view, You have charms, no doubt. </seg>
<seg id="533"> But if a man submits himself to me, I set a trap... </seg>
<seg id="534"> I don't care about traps. Love me! </seg>
<seg id="535"> - You see? He has already begun to give orders. - Marry me! </seg>
<seg id="536"> I am a frivolous woman, Herr Kushemski. </seg>
<seg id="537"> To love me, you will have to give proof of great courage . </seg>
<seg id="538"> - I have already explained my principles. - I do not care. </seg>
<seg id="539"> - I want you to be my wife. - You do not know anything about me. </seg>
<seg id="540"> - I submit to you - That's absurd. </seg>
<seg id="541"> I'll give you complete power over me, for eternity. </seg>
<seg id="542"> Do with me what you wish. </seg>
<seg id="543"> - I submit, hit me if you want. - This is unexpected news to me. </seg>
<seg id="544"> - Let's try it a new way. - What way? </seg>
<seg id="545"> - Put yourself center stage upstage. - No, I'm fine here. </seg>
<seg id="546"> You should move there! </seg>
<seg id="547"> Take the power and stand in a position of power. </seg>
<seg id="548"> OK. Continue. </seg>
<seg id="549"> - This is unexpected news to me. - This isn't working. </seg>
<seg id="550"> Do not move, try it here. </seg>

<seg id="554"> - This is unexpected news to me. - You don't even pretend to try? </seg>
<seg id="555"> You wanted me to go here, So I went here. </seg>
<seg id="556"> It's just an audition. </seg>
<seg id="557"> I am listening also to see if you agree. </seg>
<seg id="558"> Do what I say and stay there. </seg>
<seg id="559"> I'll give you complete power over me for eternity, unconditionally. </seg>
<seg id="560"> Do with me what you want. I submit. </seg>

<seg id="567"> .. to offer you stockings, to put on your shoes .. . </seg>
<seg id="568"> .. to no longer have my own will. </seg>
<seg id="569"> And that you call that love? - It's the only love there is. </seg>
<seg id="570"> In love, as in politics only one of the parties must have the power. </seg>
<seg id="571"> One must be the hammer and the other the anvil. </seg>
<seg id="572"> I gladly accept to be the anvil. </seg>
<seg id="573"> Enough. </seg>
<seg id="574"> Go on, I like it! </seg>
<seg id="575"> Thomas, you are intelligence, especially with regard to women. </seg>
<seg id="576"> - You really understand women. - Yes, yes... years of study. </seg>
<seg id="577"> - Where was I? - You are an anvil. </seg>
<seg id="578"> Vanda, I try my pain is your pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="579"> You should not ever let the feelings of others dominate. </seg>
<seg id="580"> The servant of his mistress lives to serve her. </seg>
<seg id="581"> I submit, squeeze me like a lemon. </seg>
<seg id="582"> You are incredible. </seg>
<seg id="583"> If you do not want me as a husband, take me as a slave. </seg>
<seg id="584"> Treat me with divine cruelty. </seg>
<seg id="585"> Why should I mistreat those who love me? </seg>
<seg id="586"> - But I'd love it even more. - I do not want to be adored. </seg>
<seg id="587"> All women want to be worshiped, as our Creator. </seg>
<seg id="588"> I am created! I am ruined! I am reduced to a thing! </seg>
<seg id="589"> CELLPHONE RINGS </seg>
<seg id="590"> One moment, please excuse me. </seg>
<seg id="591"> Hello? Yes </seg>
<seg id="592"> No, they are not out yet. </seg>
<seg id="593"> It's all right. </seg>
<seg id="594"> It's all good just... </seg>
<seg id="595"> I don't know. </seg>
<seg id="596"> At times, eh? </seg>
<seg id="597"> I'll call you when I get out? </seg>
<seg id="598"> Yeah, me too, my love. </seg>
<seg id="599"> - Yeah, so... Yes, all right. </seg>
<seg id="600"> Excuse me, huh? </seg>
<seg id="601"> You're not listening. </seg>
<seg id="602"> This time it's a temporary agency, maybe they have something for me? </seg>
<seg id="603"> A typist? Night work in a major law firm. </seg>
<seg id="604"> The contract is for tomorrow. Blah Blah Blah </seg>
<seg id="605"> I don't know! </seg>
<seg id="606"> What will be, will be. </seg>
<seg id="607"> That's life. That's life little one. Bye! </seg>
<seg id="608"> - Crazy! - Your better half? </seg>
<seg id="609"> You think so? - What did you call him? </seg>
<seg id="610"> - I don't know... asshole? - Ah, okay. </seg>
<seg id="611"> - You wonder why I lied to you? - No, it does not concern me. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Why do you say that Vanda? </seg>
<seg id="613"> "I do not deny anything, There are other fish in the sea." </seg>
<seg id="614"> - Why do you talk like that? - You're the hammer, he's the anvil. </seg>
<seg id="615"> What should I say? "Yes, dear, whatever you want"? </seg>
<seg id="616"> This has nothing to do with love, but with my ass. </seg>
<seg id="617"> If I say so, You have to take it. </seg>
<seg id="618"> - This is dialogue from the play. - Oh yeah? </seg>
<seg id="619"> You're making fun of me? </seg>
<seg id="620"> - I do not know, do you think I am? - Will you stop pretending. </seg>
<seg id="621"> For once I cannot tell what you are thinking. </seg>
<seg id="622"> Talking with you is more complicated than doing the tango. </seg>
<seg id="623"> Want to go for a coffee? </seg>
<seg id="624"> Why do you say that? </seg>
<seg id="625"> - You're hitting on me? - Absolutely not! </seg>
<seg id="626"> I'm just offering you a coffee. </seg>
<seg id="627"> - But it's symbolic coffee. - No, no, it's a real coffee. </seg>
<seg id="628"> What would she say if your wife saw you give me a "real coffee"? </seg>
<seg id="629"> - I'm not married. - Ah yes... </seg>
<seg id="630"> I thought so before the phone call. </seg>
<seg id="631"> - It was my fiancee. - It's the same thing. </seg>
<seg id="632"> You would think that? In an interview you said: </seg>
<seg id="633"> "The theater is the best way to get girls into bed." </seg>
<seg id="634"> Don't tell me that you read that stuff. </seg>
<seg id="635"> I was young, it was my first interview. </seg>
<seg id="636"> - You have never been married? - Never. </seg>
<seg id="637"> - You still live with your mother? - I'm weird, but not that weird. </seg>
<seg id="638"> I fox fur her passion? </seg>
<seg id="639"> - No, it's love. - She is really strange. </seg>
<seg id="640"> And I want my woman to be my muse. </seg>
<seg id="641"> So your girlfriend has a pair of wings and everything else? </seg>
<seg id="642"> In the vision of love one must jump completely in. </seg>
<seg id="643"> And she dives right in? - Yes, like a fish... </seg>
<seg id="644"> .. with fireworks, dizziness and thunder. </seg>
<seg id="645"> So, coffee yes? Or no coffee? </seg>
<seg id="646"> I can't conceive of a man giving me his life only by becoming my slave. </seg>
<seg id="647"> I would say that we are not at all compatible Herr Kushemski. </seg>
<seg id="648"> We will cancel each other out. </seg>
<seg id="649"> And I would say that we are made for each other. </seg>
<seg id="650"> Is that not what he feels, Vanda? Is not that what you feel? </seg>
<seg id="651"> I propose we try a contract, as in business. </seg>
<seg id="652"> You will have a year to prove you are the man I need. </seg>
<seg id="653"> - A year is a long time. - I have not finished yet. </seg>
<seg id="654"> - I beg your pardon. - You will be my slave for a year. </seg>
<seg id="655"> So you prepared everything. </seg>
<seg id="656"> You planned everything before entering here. </seg>
<seg id="657"> - Do you believe that? - Stop being naive. </seg>
<seg id="658"> - It's you, you're the author of this. - I'm not sure I had everything ready. </seg>
<seg id="659"> I'm being sincere, I swear. </seg>
<seg id="660"> So you wanted this? You seem ambivalent. </seg>
<seg id="661"> - Ambiguous. - That yes. </seg>
<seg id="662"> Or is it a slut you crave, ready to enjoy everything. </seg>
<seg id="663"> A craving whore? I had never thought of you as that. </seg>
<seg id="664"> It can be even more complicated. </seg>
<seg id="665"> "Be my slave for a year and then I'll let you fuck me." </seg>
<seg id="666"> - She is always ambivalent, right? - Ambiguous. </seg>
<seg id="667"> - Ambiguous. - From my point of view, rather than Kushemski's... </seg>
<seg id="668"> This could be his last chance. Maybe the only one. </seg>
<seg id="669"> And to do what? </seg>
<seg id="670"> - To live. - Ok, good. </seg>
<seg id="671"> He loves the whip and wants to know if she likes it too. </seg>
<seg id="672"> - He told her this? - She understands him. </seg>
<seg id="673"> He is a weirdo and she is an object, like all women of the 1800s. </seg>
<seg id="674"> What? </seg>
<seg id="675"> Who is she, then, Frau Vanda Jourdain? </seg>
<seg id="676"> - I am a pagan. - No, I'm serious. </seg>
<seg id="677"> Try again. </seg>
<seg id="678"> Where did you get this? What is your story? </seg>
<seg id="679"> Daughter of the military, grew up around soldiers, An orphan. </seg>
<seg id="680"> Where have you been? ln which cities and which countries? </seg>
<seg id="681"> I will write a contract stipulating that you will be my slave for a year. </seg>
<seg id="682"> - I'll be at your command. - Done deal. </seg>
<seg id="683"> Let's shake on it. </seg>
<seg id="684"> - There's a real Greek at the hotel. A Greek? - Yes </seg>
<seg id="685"> He's from Athens. </seg>
<seg id="686"> Mounts a stallion as white as snow wearing boots and black leather. </seg>
<seg id="687"> I want you to get me the number of his room. </seg>
<seg id="688"> - But, Vanda... What is it? </seg>
<seg id="689"> - Already reluctant to obey me? - I beg your pardon. </seg>
<seg id="690"> Tomorrow I'll wait in the birch forest, near the statue of Aphrodite. </seg>
<seg id="691"> - At what time? Wait for me until such time as I decide to come. </seg>
<seg id="692"> - Very good. - Don't come without the room number of the Greek. </seg>
<seg id="693"> Now kiss my foot. </seg>
<seg id="694"> And he kneels and kisses her foot. </seg>
<seg id="695"> I love this part, it is very direct. </seg>
<seg id="696"> Pass me my fur now. </seg>
<seg id="697"> S�verin, how will it end? </seg>
<seg id="698"> This depends only on you, Vanda Frau von Dunayev, not on me. </seg>
<seg id="699"> Thanks for the coffee, slave. </seg>
<seg id="700"> OK, I'm leaving right now. A coffee sounds good. </seg>
<seg id="701"> That was intense. The handshake was electric. </seg>
<seg id="702"> The happiness of a time when people were more introverted. </seg>
<seg id="703"> A simple conversation emanated eroticism. </seg>
<seg id="704"> Conversation. The only thing to put between your teeth. </seg>
<seg id="705"> The book begins like this, right? </seg>
<seg id="706"> - The book? - Yes </seg>
<seg id="707"> Where is the beginning scene... </seg>
<seg id="708"> .. when Venus appears to be naked wearing fur in front of the fireplace? </seg>
<seg id="709"> - You've read "The Venus in Furs"? - I looked it over. </seg>
<seg id="710"> When you said you did not know about it you lied. </seg>
<seg id="711"> OK, I lied a little. </seg>
<seg id="712"> - Why didn't you keep that scene? - I did not know how to use it. </seg>
<seg id="713"> Just put it at the beginning, before the guy with Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="714"> You can not think of doing "The Venus in Furs" without Venus. </seg>
<seg id="715"> You can use the same actress for Vanda and Venus. </seg>
<seg id="716"> - Naked on stage? That's no problem. - Yes, I'll think about it. </seg>
<seg id="717"> - Why don't we improvise? It'll give you some ideas. - How? </seg>
<seg id="718"> You have to change the lights. </seg>
<seg id="719"> - Where we are at the beginning of the play? - In Kushemski's room... </seg>
<seg id="720"> .. in the middle of the night. </seg>
<seg id="721"> Ok, middle of the night, two in the morning. </seg>
<seg id="722"> Let's turn them down a little... </seg>
<seg id="723"> Fire in the fireplace, side garden. There! </seg>
<seg id="724"> Yes, very well. </seg>
<seg id="725"> Kushemski What are you doing? </seg>
<seg id="726"> - I do not know... is he in bed? - What a fantasy! </seg>
<seg id="727"> Too obvious? </seg>
<seg id="728"> He is reading when he meets Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="729"> Do not read too early, we are not in the library. </seg>
<seg id="730"> Perhaps he could be writing in his diary. </seg>
<seg id="731"> I like that. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Yes </seg>
<seg id="733"> OK I'm Venus. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Ah shit, who cares? </seg>
<seg id="735"> Face me as if you were naked. - You're hitting on me? </seg>
<seg id="736"> Imagine that I'm your girlfriend and this is unexpected. </seg>
<seg id="737"> - Ah, it's the first time I've done this. - You say that to all the girls. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Yes, but for me it is the truth. </seg>
<seg id="739"> The fire in the fireplace comes to life, we see Venus naked... </seg>
<seg id="740"> .. lasciviously wrapped in a fur coat... - Uh huh </seg>
<seg id="741"> Now wrap me in fur. </seg>
<seg id="742"> You're the director. </seg>
<seg id="743"> I said "lascivious." </seg>
<seg id="744"> Now you go to the desk. </seg>
<seg id="745"> Become the character. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Write in his diary. </seg>
<seg id="747"> - Really write. - I'm doing it. </seg>
<seg id="748"> But out loud, we are in the theater! If not, how do we know who he is? </seg>
<seg id="749"> We are at the beginning of the play. </seg>
<seg id="750"> The scene is illuminated little by little... </seg>
<seg id="751"> We hear the ticking of a grandfather clock. </seg>
<seg id="752"> Tic tac... </seg>
<seg id="753"> .. tick... </seg>
<seg id="754"> .. tick... </seg>
<seg id="755"> ..tic tac! </seg>
<seg id="757"> Two in the morning. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Living in a spa... </seg>
<seg id="759"> .. surrounded by forests and mountains. </seg>
<seg id="760"> It's a moonless night, darkness and silence reign. </seg>
<seg id="761"> (VANDA WHISTLING) A Moment! I hear a sparrow. </seg>
<seg id="762"> - A nightingale. - A nightingale. </seg>
<seg id="763"> VANDA MEOWS </seg>
<seg id="764"> And the cry of a cat in heat. </seg>
<seg id="765"> I feel terribly alone... </seg>
<seg id="766"> .. unhappy, unfulfilled. </seg>
<seg id="767"> (In German) Good evening Sir. </seg>
<seg id="768"> Well, the Germans have invaded again? </seg>
<seg id="769"> I hope I did not disturb you. </seg>
<seg id="770"> Absolutely not. </seg>
<seg id="771"> Hail, Aphrodite. </seg>
<seg id="772"> - So now you have not forgotten me? - Forget? </seg>
<seg id="773"> My most dear old enemy? </seg>
<seg id="774"> - You're too kind. - Yes </seg>
<seg id="775"> I do not have a right to a little kiss? </seg>
<seg id="776"> - That's better, but Thomas... - Oh! - I told Thomas? Oops! </seg>
<seg id="777"> It's so cold in here! </seg>
<seg id="778"> Every time I come to visit you, I am cold. </seg>
<seg id="779"> (SNEEZES) See? </seg>
<seg id="780"> I already catching a cold. </seg>
<seg id="781"> If you dodidn't pass the time walking around naked... </seg>
<seg id="782"> However, I am Venus, I have to be naked. </seg>
<seg id="783"> It is part of the job. </seg>
<seg id="784"> Do not you want to take off those rough clothes and come here and hold me close to you? </seg>
<seg id="785"> There is so much room here under my fur. </seg>
<seg id="786"> No, thank you. </seg>
<seg id="787"> I brought this vision to you, directly from Olympus. </seg>
<seg id="788"> It is divine! </seg>
<seg id="789"> - Do you not see the label? Made in Olympus. </seg>
<seg id="790"> Why should I care about your vision? </seg>
<seg id="791"> I know your small flaw. </seg>
<seg id="792"> You're not interested in women. </seg>
<seg id="793"> You just like their fur, should marry an otter. </seg>
<seg id="794"> I understand it better with an otter than with a woman. </seg>
<seg id="795"> But if I spread legs under my mink... </seg>
<seg id="796"> .. would you refuse a little love? </seg>
<seg id="797"> Is it t 'a little' love you suggest? </seg>
<seg id="798"> No, it is the power that interests you. </seg>
<seg id="799"> - Dare you resist me? - Yes, I dare. </seg>
<seg id="800"> Séférin, I want you on the ground, at my feet. </seg>
<seg id="801"> - Beg me. - Never. </seg>
<seg id="802"> You already belong to me and I will belong until the end of time. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - Never. - (In German) Goodbye my friend. </seg>
<seg id="804"> I'll be back. </seg>
<seg id="805"> And then, poof, she disappears. </seg>
<seg id="806"> Whew! - Not bad, eh? </seg>
<seg id="807"> - Not bad?... - You could write it down and put it in a play. </seg>
<seg id="808"> That's a good idea. </seg>
<seg id="809"> - In this context... - her accent could be like Marlene Dietrich. </seg>
<seg id="810"> Yes, that would work very well. </seg>
<seg id="811"> This gives a different picture of Kushemski. </seg>
<seg id="812"> Yes, in the middle of the night there is a vision of Venus... </seg>
<seg id="813"> .. and then the next morning with Vanda: "I saw her, I beg you." </seg>
<seg id="814"> We conclude by lowering the lights... </seg>
<seg id="815"> .. and then when you get up in the morning again comes knock, knock... </seg>
<seg id="816"> .. and then Venus reappears disguised as Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="817"> - To take revenge. - But yes, it's great! </seg>
<seg id="818"> So are you? - What? </seg>
<seg id="819"> Are you he? </seg>
<seg id="820"> Kushemski - Novacek, Novacek - Kushemski. </seg>
<seg id="821"> - No, not me. You said that there is a lot of you in there. </seg>
<seg id="822"> Then maybe you are Vanda? </seg>
<seg id="823"> - The play has nothing to do with me. - Sure, you're just the author. </seg>
<seg id="824"> Oops, the adapter. </seg>
<seg id="825"> Type: "If a critic says that that's me, kill him." </seg>
<seg id="826"> - I have the right to invent characters. - Of course adapter Novacek. </seg>
<seg id="827"> Just by chance you came across in the characters in a novel about sadomasochism. </seg>
<seg id="828"> No, it's a famous book and I... </seg>
<seg id="829"> Didn't you experience this "unpredictable moment" at the age of twelve? </seg>
<seg id="830"> - No. - ln the library... </seg>
<seg id="831"> - No! - With a cat. </seg>
<seg id="832"> No. </seg>
<seg id="833"> She's still waiting for your "big moment"? </seg>
<seg id="834"> It's not a damn bit like that! </seg>
<seg id="835"> I find the relationship between the two characters both fascinating and complex. Very rich. </seg>
<seg id="836"> - Of course! - I love the emotional depth of the characters. </seg>
<seg id="837"> Don't you see more of this kind of thing nowadays. </seg>
<seg id="838"> Don't you see more of this kind rage nowadays. </seg>
<seg id="839"> - I should submit it some friends of mine. - Okay. </seg>
<seg id="840"> Very well, then I don't understand anything about anything. </seg>
<seg id="841"> When you return home, your fiancee doesn't tie you to the bed and whip you? </seg>
<seg id="842"> No. </seg>
<seg id="843"> You should ask her and see if your fiancee will do it. </seg>
<seg id="844"> - Stop calling her "fiancee." - Excuse me. </seg>
<seg id="845"> Should I call her your better half? </seg>
<seg id="846"> - I don't like that very much. - Would you tell me if you were afraid? </seg>
<seg id="847"> This is not about us. </seg>
<seg id="848"> Let me guess about your... </seg>
<seg id="849"> Marie-Cécile. </seg>
<seg id="850"> Marie-Cécile. I bet she's younger than you. </seg>
<seg id="851"> Good deduction. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Definitely grew up in a nice little house a good family in Provence. </seg>
<seg id="853"> - I bet from La Baule. - Nantes, actually. </seg>
<seg id="854"> But I bet her family spent the weekend in La Baule... </seg>
<seg id="855"> .. in a beautiful villa with a garden. </seg>
<seg id="856"> She goes sailing and loves seafood. </seg>
<seg id="857"> Yes, it's true. </seg>
<seg id="858"> She is tall, slightly authoritarian, but without being disagreeable. </seg>
<seg id="859"> with wonderful hair... </seg>
<seg id="860"> .. Long legs and a nice pair of... </seg>
<seg id="861"> .. eyes. </seg>
<seg id="862"> A mind to be respected. </seg>
<seg id="863"> She went to preparatory school in Paris, of course to Louis Le Grand. </seg>
<seg id="864"> Am I wrong? </seg>
<seg id="865"> Henry IV, School of Economic Sciences - And she has a doctorate? </seg>
<seg id="866"> - She is finishing her thesis in sociology. - She has a dog? </seg>
<seg id="867"> Let's see... I would say a labrador. </seg>
<seg id="868"> It's called... </seg>
<seg id="869"> It has an unusual name that is a little 'intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="870"> - Bourdieu? - Derrida. </seg>
<seg id="871"> You are not lacking in culture I see. </seg>
<seg id="872"> I bet that she's a blonde... </seg>
<seg id="873"> .. she likes a small seedy theater and has a Belgian cactus... </seg>
<seg id="874"> .. Not exactly the Comédie Française. </seg>
<seg id="875"> No, there is taste in her family. Am I right? </seg>
<seg id="876"> Of course, I'm right. Good. </seg>
<seg id="877"> But she is an artist and you lost your head over this Marie-Cécile... </seg>
<seg id="878"> .. and her sensitivity. </seg>
<seg id="879"> "You're perhaps the first man I have ever met... </seg>
<seg id="880"> .. who has a real sensitivity." </seg>
<seg id="881"> She loves books, the opera, the ballet things like that. </seg>
<seg id="882"> In the evening, watch and talk about the Arts last Goncourt... </seg>
<seg id="883"> .. and then fuck quietly. </seg>
<seg id="884"> Nothing is better than a quiet sex session to relax. </seg>
<seg id="885"> But there's a voice that echoes in his head... </seg>
<seg id="886"> .. a voice that demands other things. </seg>
<seg id="887"> I do not know what it is but it echoes. </seg>
<seg id="888"> Boom. </seg>
<seg id="889"> Boom. </seg>
<seg id="890"> Boom. </seg>
<seg id="891"> In the meantime you are happy. </seg>
<seg id="892"> You truly, truly love her... </seg>
<seg id="893"> .. and spend a quiet life looking Arty... </seg>
<seg id="894"> .. and talking about the latest Goncourt. </seg>
<seg id="895"> You will have children who will live just like you and then you will die. </seg>
<seg id="896"> Shall we continue to read? </seg>
<seg id="897"> Yes, let's continue. </seg>
<seg id="898"> The meeting in the birch forest? - Okay. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Let's pretend that's the statue of Venus. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Hail, Aphrodite. </seg>
<seg id="901"> Hail, Aphrodite... </seg>
<seg id="902"> re-read the text quickly? </seg>
<seg id="903"> No, Séνerin. </seg>
<seg id="904"> No, no, this is not good. </seg>
<seg id="905"> All these stories of bondage and domination... </seg>
<seg id="906"> You have corrupted me with all this talk. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I am convinced that she would feel pleasure to dominate a man. </seg>
<seg id="908"> - No. - Maybe even to torture. </seg>
<seg id="909"> - No. - Admit it. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Not for me. </seg>
<seg id="911"> - How can I make you see reason? - To hell with reason! </seg>
<seg id="912"> Séνerin, do you really not understand? </seg>
<seg id="913"> You will never be safe in the hands of a woman... </seg>
<seg id="914"> .. whoever she is. </seg>
<seg id="915"> But this play is sexist. I want to yell! </seg>
<seg id="916"> What is so sexist? </seg>
<seg id="917"> "You will never be safe in the hands of a woman." </seg>
<seg id="918"> - But it's in the book... - you can't change anything? </seg>
<seg id="919"> - The book is sexist. - The book is not sexist. </seg>
<seg id="920"> - On the contrary, it is something... - A classic of world literature. </seg>
<seg id="921"> - That's what you were about to say? - Not exactly. </seg>
<seg id="922"> And this? </seg>
<seg id="923"> We do not have a certain Titian here, sweetheart. </seg>
<seg id="924"> - It's a nice BDSM porno. - What the...? </seg>
<seg id="925"> This story is nothing more than a big cliche. - And why is it a chiche? </seg>
<seg id="926"> He is spanked and suddenly he likes to be whipped? </seg>
<seg id="927"> - It's what happened to the author. - And it happened to you? - No! </seg>
<seg id="928"> Then what? </seg>
<seg id="929"> For me it is a play about two people who are united eternally. </seg>
<seg id="930"> their hearts are handcuffed to each other. </seg>
<seg id="931"> - Shackled in perversion. - No, handcuffed in passion. </seg>
<seg id="932"> - Yes, but it's his passion! - They have a chemistry... </seg>
<seg id="933"> .. it's the meeting of two people lighting fire to the powder. </seg>
<seg id="934"> This is the struggle of the sexes, and classes. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Vanda is an innocent woman who runs into a pervert. </seg>
<seg id="936"> - But then you do not understand anything! - Vanda says: "He has corrupted me!" </seg>
<seg id="937"> And what if if her thirst for domination was asleep inside her? </seg>
<seg id="938"> Kushemski? If he was to awaken it? </seg>
<seg id="939"> And if she was simply a woman? </seg>
<seg id="940"> This text brochure looks like it was written by an old Austrian misogynist. </seg>
<seg id="941"> He forces her to a game of power and then blames her. </seg>
<seg id="942"> - That's not it. - That's exactly it! </seg>
<seg id="943"> - How? - Look at the end for example. - Yes? </seg>
<seg id="944"> Vanda tells the Greek to whip him... </seg>
<seg id="945"> Kushemski .. then leaves him there with his cock in hand... </seg>
<seg id="946"> .. and it would be her fault even though he was the one to want it? </seg>
<seg id="947"> No, I think that little Kushemski has the hots for the Greek. </seg>
<seg id="948"> I wonder how you can be so bitchy at this point. </seg>
<seg id="949"> How can you interpret Vanda so well... </seg>
<seg id="950"> .. and then be bitchy at this point? </seg>
<seg id="951"> Stupid cocksucking actress! </seg>
<seg id="952"> What a cunt! </seg>
<seg id="953"> Shit! </seg>
<seg id="954"> - I'm sorry. - Excuse me? </seg>
<seg id="955"> I'm sorry, I screwed up. </seg>
<seg id="956"> Yes, but what is said is said. </seg>
<seg id="957"> Let's say that the meaning of the play is "beware of your desires." </seg>
<seg id="958"> Since you knock on this door... </seg>
<seg id="959"> here is the argument of the play... .. you do not take the piss out of a goddess: </seg>
<seg id="960"> .. so to speak. </seg>
<seg id="961"> So to speak. </seg>
<seg id="962"> What is the modern way of saying "so to speak"? </seg>
<seg id="963"> "asshole". </seg>
<seg id="964"> If you say so. </seg>
<seg id="965"> Luckily goddesses do not exist otherwise we would be in deep shit. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Okay, you're right. </seg>
<seg id="967"> I accept everything you said. </seg>
<seg id="968"> Can we... can we continue? </seg>
<seg id="969"> Please Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="970"> You do not understand that you will never be safe in the hands of a woman? </seg>
<seg id="971"> Whoever she is. </seg>
<seg id="972"> We are two adventurers, Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="973"> Let's explore the limits of human nature. </seg>
<seg id="974"> You're sick. </seg>
<seg id="975"> You have been poisoned by the countess and now suffer the effects. </seg>
<seg id="976"> - But she adores effects like me. - No... </seg>
<seg id="977"> You like having complete power over me. - No. </seg>
<seg id="978"> Your desires are my orders. </seg>
<seg id="979"> I beg and crawl at your feet. </seg>
<seg id="980"> Do with me whatever you want. </seg>
<seg id="981"> You are a mad visionary, a fanatic. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Who is willing to do anything, to realize his dream. </seg>
<seg id="983"> - But my dream is you. - Get away from me, Séνerin. </seg>
<seg id="984"> Before it is too late. </seg>
<seg id="985"> - Do you love me? - I do not know. </seg>
<seg id="986"> Decide, do something to be convinced. </seg>
<seg id="987"> - How? - Do what all lovers do. </seg>
<seg id="988"> - Let me suffer. - This disgusts me. </seg>
<seg id="989"> And I hate to pretend. </seg>
<seg id="990"> I'm not the countess, your aunt. I am myself. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Repeat the line, the challenge. </seg>
<seg id="992"> I'm not the countess, your aunt. I am myself. </seg>
<seg id="993"> - Again, get angry! - What do you want from me, Thomas? </seg>
<seg id="994"> I'm not your fucking aunt, I am me! What do you want? </seg>
<seg id="995"> - I don't know!! - This time it is no longer the play. </seg>
<seg id="996"> - I want a lot more. - But you're not her. </seg>
<seg id="997"> I'm just a poor bitch who needs the work. </seg>
<seg id="998"> And I'm not your aunt, I am me. Okay so? </seg>
<seg id="999"> Yeah, okay. Very well. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> I can't do this part. It's too hard. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> Don't go, please. Vanda. Stay here. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> Say "I beg you." </seg>
<seg id="1003"> I beg you. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> - You're bad. - I'm completely in your power. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> Liar, you are not in my power, I am in your hands. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> You're supposed to be my slave but it is you who dominates me. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> - It's true isn't it? - What? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> You never stop saying that I have the power but you've got it. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> The more he submits the more he dominates. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> It's complex, yes. </seg>
<seg id="1011"> Here is the contract that we talked about. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> It establishes that you agree to a test of total submission. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> You will be my slave. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> Completely give up your own identity. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> Your body, your soul, your honor will all belong to me. </seg>
<seg id="1016"> Forever. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> Sign at the bottom. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> Well? </seg>
<seg id="1019"> I thought my commitment would be for a year. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> - What? You are trying to dictate conditions to me? - Can I re-read the contract? </seg>
<seg id="1021"> Why? Maybe you don't trust me? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Sign. </seg>
<seg id="1023"> Good. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> From now on you will call me Madame... </seg>
<seg id="1025"> .. and you will speak only when allow it. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> You will serve me meals and await my orders in the hallway. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> In the morning you will dress me and you will dress me in the evening. </seg>
<seg id="1028"> Bring me my socks and put on my shoes. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> - I'll call you Thomas. - But I'm Gregoir in the text. </seg>
<seg id="1030"> I changed it. Henceforth, I will call you Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> You will serve as my valet and bring my coat with my coat of arms. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> And as a gentleman... - You have to keep your word. </seg>
<seg id="1033"> Don't we have a signed a contract which states that you are my slave? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> - But I'm not your slave, I'm your valet. - The difference escapes me. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> - Is it a game? - This is what I am. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> I'm Stubborn, strong-willed, greedy... </seg>
<seg id="1037"> .. and when I start something, I see it through to the end. </seg>
<seg id="1038"> The more you resist, the more I persist. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> But, deep down, your nature is noble. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> What do you know about my nature aside from what you think you know? </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Please forgive me, I was despicable. </seg>
<seg id="1042"> Give me your passport and your money. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> - But .. - give it to me! </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Tomorrow we leave for Florence. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> I will travel in first class, you in third. </seg>
<seg id="1046"> - In third class? - You will eat and sleep with the servants. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> - What is it, Thomas? You have something to say? - Where will this end? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> End? We havn't even started. </seg>
<seg id="1049"> But Vanda, I... </seg>
<seg id="1050"> She slaps him... </seg>
<seg id="1051"> .. kisses him... </seg>
<seg id="1052"> .. and caresses his cheek... </seg>
<seg id="1053"> Did I hurt you, my dear? </seg>
<seg id="1054"> Yes, you are deliciously evil. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> Well. </seg>
<seg id="1056"> What did you learn about the handsome Greek? </seg>
<seg id="1057"> His name is Alexis, he is a count. </seg>
<seg id="1058"> - He's beautiful, isn't he? - Ah, he's fascinating. </seg>
<seg id="1059"> Kushemski, you said you had a crush on the Greek. </seg>
<seg id="1060"> I have to take a room next to his tonight. </seg>
<seg id="1061"> I will allow Count Alexis to seduce me. </seg>
<seg id="1062"> Ah, but Vanda... </seg>
<seg id="1063"> What is it? Am I not free to do what I please? </seg>
<seg id="1064"> - You turns me on. - Silence, dog! </seg>
<seg id="1065"> Bring me a rod of birch wood. </seg>
<seg id="1066"> He takes the branch to her... </seg>
<seg id="1067"> Listen to this hiss? </seg>
<seg id="1068"> This sound vibrates my nerves like a tuning fork. </seg>
<seg id="1069"> I have only one desire: to hear you groan under the blows. </seg>
<seg id="1070"> Feel Herr Doktor Kushemski what I crave... </seg>
<seg id="1071"> .. crying like a little girl, my heart leaps in my chest. </seg>
<seg id="1072"> The air is hot. </seg>
<seg id="1073"> What have you done? What have you done? Bla bla bla bla bla bla! </seg>
<seg id="1074"> How bla bla bla? - No. What do you mean? </seg>
<seg id="1075"> Vanda turns into evil witch. </seg>
<seg id="1076"> Air glowing, my nerves are a tuning fork... </seg>
<seg id="1077"> Let's have lightning and drum rolls while we're at. </seg>
<seg id="1078"> Tomas, I really, really love it so much. </seg>
<seg id="1079"> I like it too, but this has already been seen and reviewed. </seg>
<seg id="1080"> What do you mean? </seg>
<seg id="1081"> The play is... my play! </seg>
<seg id="1082"> It's a superb play and no one will make me change my mind. </seg>
<seg id="1083"> Damn! </seg>
<seg id="1084"> You don't know anything... </seg>
<seg id="1085"> I do not believe, I refuse to demolish my work... </seg>
<seg id="1086"> .. Whether you are in the play or not! Go to hell. </seg>
<seg id="1087"> Okay, it's you who decides. </seg>
<seg id="1088"> She takes a knife and puts it to his throat. </seg>
<seg id="1089"> God, how I hate you. </seg>
<seg id="1090"> What are you doing? What's going on? </seg>
<seg id="1091"> Do you think I don't understand your game? </seg>
<seg id="1092"> Do you think you can use me, I could subdue... </seg>
<seg id="1093"> I do not want anything of the kind, I swear. </seg>
<seg id="1094"> If you only knew how delicious this sensation is. </seg>
<seg id="1095"> You know what? </seg>
<seg id="1096"> I'll go to the Labour Court... </seg>
<seg id="1097"> -since you have has not yet decided if I will get this part. </seg>
<seg id="1098"> - I'd like to give you the part. - Now you say this. </seg>
<seg id="1099"> Will you put it in writing? CELLPHONE RINGS </seg>
<seg id="1100"> Wait, I'm sorry. </seg>
<seg id="1101"> - Yes? - Fuck you, Marie-Cécile! </seg>
<seg id="1102"> No, I'm still here. </seg>
<seg id="1103"> - I have things to finish. - He's fucking me Marie-Cécile! </seg>
<seg id="1104"> He's buggering me on all fours on the stage. - Soon. </seg>
<seg id="1105"> He fucks like a Labrador in heat! </seg>
<seg id="1106"> Yes, soon. You start eating without me, then I'll come. OK? </seg>
<seg id="1107"> But it's leftovers? Leg of lamb from yesterday? </seg>
<seg id="1108"> I'll call you when I leave and then... Later, yes. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> Yeah, okay. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> I don't know. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> I'll be back when I get back, okay? </seg>
<seg id="1112"> Fuck you. Ciao. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> - Excuse me. - There was no one on the line, right? </seg>
<seg id="1114"> What? - You pretended. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> - You pretended to talk to someone. - I was talking with my sweetheart. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> - Who is this guy? - Who says it's a guy? </seg>
<seg id="1117"> And why did you pretend? </seg>
<seg id="1118"> According to you? </seg>
<seg id="1119"> I didn't like that I had to answer the phone. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> Type  "female revenge"? Or something like that? </seg>
<seg id="1121"> Something like this, yes. </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Any other director I would have already jumped on him. </seg>
<seg id="1123"> - I am not "any other director." - Bullshit. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> If you thought you could, you would have already done it. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> Not true. </seg>
<seg id="1126"> Though I him I allowed? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> How did you know all those things about Marie-Cecile? </seg>
<seg id="1128"> I met her at the gym. - You saw her! </seg>
<seg id="1129"> She seemed very nice and very beautiful. Really. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> We were talking while we were changing in the locker room... </seg>
<seg id="1131"> .. Series "talks between girls." </seg>
<seg id="1132"> I told her I'm an actress... </seg>
<seg id="1133"> .. But I also am a private detective, on the side. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> And she told me about her boyfriend. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> A very mysterious type, a writer. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> She gave me a bit 'of money to investigate you... </seg>
<seg id="1137"> .. to find out who you are, if you seriously love her, things like that. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> I do prenuptial agreements... </seg>
<seg id="1139"> I do research on criminal record and financial status. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> I have to meet her later at a hotel... </seg>
<seg id="1141"> .. and give her a full account. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> She has a nice body, huh? Congratulations </seg>
<seg id="1143"> You're amazing! </seg>
<seg id="1144"> - When a man tells me that I sniff a trap. - Ah, touché. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> - Marie-Cécile never showers at the gym. - Ah, no? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> Yet she was wet. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> Let's finish? </seg>
<seg id="1148"> Yes </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Put this on. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Thomas, you made me wait. - I'm sorry, ma'am. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> I cleaned the silverware. </seg>
<seg id="1152"> You really look stylish wearing your uniform. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> - Thank you, ma'am. - Turn around. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> Oh yes. Definitely irresistible. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> I might even forget that you are a valet. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> - But something is missing. - Where's this coming from? It's not on... </seg>
<seg id="1157"> I'm improvising. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> Something's missing. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> Yes, really chic! </seg>
<seg id="1160"> The icing on the cake. </seg>
<seg id="1161"> - You like it? - It is very nice my lady. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> I could almost fall in love with you when I see you with this collar. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> "Almost fall in love"? This means that you don't love me! </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I get bored, I whine constantly. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> Your Count? Is he? </seg>
<seg id="1166"> You're in love with him? </seg>
<seg id="1167"> He followed me to Florence! </seg>
<seg id="1168"> He does not love you. He just wants you, as he wanted a thousand others. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> Insolent animal! How dare you speak to me in that tone? </seg>
<seg id="1170"> - Bring me my boots. - Yes, ma'am. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> Not there. In the bag... idiot. </seg>
<seg id="1172"> Yes, ma'am. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> From now on you will call me Mistress. It is more degrading. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> Yes, Mistress. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> Do you like my boots? </seg>
<seg id="1176"> Yes, Mistress. </seg>
<seg id="1177"> Do you like them? </seg>
<seg id="1178"> Yes, Mistress. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> And my legs. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> Yes, Mistress. </seg>
<seg id="1181"> Tomorrow maybe I will tie you to the fig tree that stands in the garden... </seg>
<seg id="1182"> .. and sting you with my golden clasp. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Or I could attach you naked to a plow... </seg>
<seg id="1184"> .. and lash you. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> Would you like this? </seg>
<seg id="1186"> Yes, Mistress. </seg>
<seg id="1187"> I am very pleased with you, Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> I might even give you a piece of candy. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Will there be anything else? </seg>
<seg id="1190"> Yes, one last thing. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> Call your Marie-Cécile tonight and tell her you are not coming home. </seg>
<seg id="1192"> - I can't do that. - Ah, no? </seg>
<seg id="1193"> You can't? </seg>
<seg id="1194"> No, I can't. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Don't lie to her. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> (Marie-Cécile) Hello? - Yes, Marie-Cecile? It's me. </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Tonight I cannot come home. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> - Tonight I cannot come home. - Do not explain why. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> - No, I can not tell you why. - Tell her goodbye. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> Goodbye. </seg>
<seg id="1201"> Hang up and turn off your cell phone. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> Don't you feel great? </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Colluding here the two of us together... </seg>
<seg id="1204"> This place is so nice. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> And also so quiet. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> I do not know even where I am. - But think about it. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> A new life ahead of you, of us. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> There's just us. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> We and your friend, the Count. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> Stop bothering me by speaking about him. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> Haven't I punished you enough? here's the problem. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> Just when I wanted to take you in my arms. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> you were going to... really? </seg>
<seg id="1214"> Come on. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Come here. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Take me in your arms. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> You see? </seg>
<seg id="1218"> For an hour I'll let you imagine you are free. </seg>
<seg id="1219"> In the end you will understand that you are what I want. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> An animal. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> An object. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> An empty space to fill. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> No, I will not allow it. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> - I will not, I refuse. - I beg your pardon? </seg>
<seg id="1225"> - I wrote you a letter. - A letter? </seg>
<seg id="1226"> A "Dear John" letter, perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> "The degradation is too much, you have already become unbearable." </seg>
<seg id="1228"> The degradation claiming you... </seg>
<seg id="1229"> I can not recite this passage. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> - I do not see that happening. - How would it be? </seg>
<seg id="1231"> Yet it is clear enough. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> What should I do? In your head as you see the scene? </seg>
<seg id="1233"> But it is the time when... What was the line? </seg>
<seg id="1234"> - "I wrote you a letter." - A letter... </seg>
<seg id="1235"> A "Dear John" letter, perhaps? </seg>
<seg id="1236"> - The degradation claiming you... - Lay down a bit '. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> The degradation claiming you, you've already become unbearable? </seg>
<seg id="1238"> You have to listen to her for days... </seg>
<seg id="1239"> .. you have been afraid to show it. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> So? Where is it? </seg>
<seg id="1241"> Show me this masterpiece. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> A little 'fun would not make me sick. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> That's great, Tom. Are you strong. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> You should do you Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> No, no... </seg>
<seg id="1246"> But yes! </seg>
<seg id="1247"> You have to be Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> You understand her character better than me, you created her... </seg>
<seg id="1249"> .. you know her intimately. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> - I do not know her lines. - But of course you know them. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> - Pay attention, Séverin. - I do the best I can, Mistress. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> But as usual your best is not up to par. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> - Bring me my coat. - Yes, Mistress. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> Prepare a bottle of champagne and two cocktails. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> The Count Alexis will arrive at any moment. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> - But mistress... - If you don't like it, you can leave. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> Far from my sight. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> Your fur, Mistress. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> You will marry the Count Alexis, Mistress? </seg>
<seg id="1260"> I will not lie anymore, Séνerin. That man makes me shudder. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> Great! </seg>
<seg id="1262"> Wait! </seg>
<seg id="1263"> Sit down. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> It lives in my thoughts, I can not drive it away. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> It lives in my thoughts, I can not drive it away. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> - I'm suffering. - You're magnificent. </seg>
<seg id="1267"> - Still you love this suffering. - Get up and come back a little later. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> If you ask me to become your wife, I will say yes. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> You are magical. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> You know it's very jealous of you? </seg>
<seg id="1271"> I told him everything about the two of us. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> He probably has threatened to kill you. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> In fact... </seg>
<seg id="1274"> - The Count hit you? Yes </seg>
<seg id="1275"> - You liked it? Yes, it was sublime. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> More intense. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> - Yes, and it was sublime. - Even more intense. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> - He slapped you in the face? - Yes </seg>
<seg id="1279"> And it was sublime. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> - Oh! - I'll kill you, both of you. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> I tear out your heart, throw it to the dogs! </seg>
<seg id="1282"> You are cursed! </seg>
<seg id="1283"> - What curse? Yes, kill me Séverin! </seg>
<seg id="1284"> I'm sick of this comedy. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> What comedy? </seg>
<seg id="1286"> But how can you love me? I was terrible with you. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> I have done everything to save you... </seg>
<seg id="1288"> .. to heal, to show you how much I love you. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> All to no avail? </seg>
<seg id="1290"> None. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> It was just a game? A play? And the contract? </seg>
<seg id="1292"> Oh, the contract... </seg>
<seg id="1293"> My little, sweet, silly... </seg>
<seg id="1294"> S�verin, I loved you from the first moment. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> I could not tell you why. I am not who you think. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I am weak, and lost... don't you understand? </seg>
<seg id="1297"> Not bad. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> It is I who should be submissive. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> I who should be whipped and tied up. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> I think I will tie you to the statue with a pair of your socks. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> That's What you want, right? - Yes, I beg you. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> Do with me what you wish. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> - Promise to never leave me. - I'll never leave you, I swear. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Turn around. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> The hands? </seg>
<seg id="1306"> I've dreamed of this moment ever since I met you. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> Louder, louder. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> I humble myself. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Mortify, subdue me, I implore you. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> Very well, Tom. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> This should be really good. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> This is great. But you know what is the problem? </seg>
<seg id="1313"> Whatever we say or do, this piece is degrading. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> It is an insult to women. Your pornography. </seg>
<seg id="1315"> - But what are you saying? - A damsel in distress... </seg>
<seg id="1316"> .. a poor defenseless bitch who humbles herself before a man: </seg>
<seg id="1317"> "Beat me, hurt me, I'm just a woman." </seg>
<seg id="1318"> Holy cow! </seg>
<seg id="1319"> - Damn! - Are these emotions too strong? </seg>
<seg id="1320"> That's good. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> "I don't see this kind of anger these days." </seg>
<seg id="1322"> But Vanda... </seg>
<seg id="1323"> Thank me. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Thanks to whom? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> Thank you, Mistress. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> You thought you could dupe the stupid starlet, huh? </seg>
<seg id="1328"> - To use her to satisfy your sick inclinations? - No. </seg>
<seg id="1329"> Like Frankenstein build yourself a little female of your own? </seg>
<seg id="1330"> - You believed you could use me to humiliate you? - No, Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> I swear! </seg>
<seg id="1332"> - Thank you, Mistress. - Thank you, goddess. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> Thank you... goddess. </seg>

<doc docid="zelig" genre="subtitles" origlang="en" sysid="sys">
<seg id="1"> ﻿He was the phenomenon of the '20s. </seg>
<seg id="2"> When you think, at the time, he was as well-known as Lindbergh, it's really quite astonishing. </seg>
<seg id="3"> His story reflected the nature of our civilization, the character of our times, yet it was also one man's story. And all the themes of our culture were there. Heroism, will, things like that. </seg>
<seg id="4"> But when you look back on it, it was very strange. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Well, it is ironic to see how quickly he has faded from memory, considering what an astounding record he made. </seg>
<seg id="6"> He was, of course, very amusing, but at the same time touched a nerve in people, perhaps in a way in which they would prefer not to be touched. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It certainly is a very bizarre story. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The year is 1928. </seg>
<seg id="9"> America, enjoying a decade of unequalled prosperity, has gone wild. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The Jazz Age, it is called. The rhythms are syncopated, the morals are looser, the liquor is cheaper, when you can get it. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It is a time of diverse heroes and madcap stunts, of speakeasies and flamboyant parties. </seg>
<seg id="12"> One typical party occurs at the Long Island estate </seg>
<seg id="13"> of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Porter Sutton, socialites, patrons of the arts. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Politicians and poets rub elbows with the cream of high society. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Present at the party is Scott Fitzgerald, who is to cast perspective on the '20s for all future generations. </seg>
<seg id="16"> He writes in his notebook about a curious little man named Leon Selwyn or Zelman, who seemed clearly to be an aristocrat, and extolled the very rich as he chatted with socialites. </seg>
<seg id="17"> He spoke adoringly of Coolidge and the Republican party, all in an upper-class Boston accent. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "An hour later," writes Fitzgerald, "I was stunned to see the same man speaking with the kitchen help." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "Now, he claimed to be a Democrat and his accent seemed to be coarse, "as if he were one of the crowd." It is the first small notice taken of Leonard Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Florida, one year later. </seg>
<seg id="21"> An odd incident occurs at the New York Yankees' training camp. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Journalists, anxious as always to immortalize the exploits of the great home-run hitters, notice a strange new player waiting his turn at bat after Babe Ruth. </seg>
<seg id="23"> He is listed on the roster as Lou Zelig, but no one on the team has heard of him. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Security guards are called, and he is escorted from the premises. </seg>
<seg id="25"> It appears as a small item in the next day's newspaper. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Chicago, Illinois, that same year. </seg>
<seg id="27"> There is a private party at a speakeasy on the South Side. </seg>
<seg id="28"> People from the most respectable walks of life dance and drink bathtub gin. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Present that evening was Calvin Turner, a waiter. </seg>
<seg id="30"> A lotta customers, a lotta gangsters came in the place. </seg>
<seg id="31"> 'Cause they always good tippers and take good care of us, and of course we try to take care of our customers. </seg>
<seg id="32"> But on this particular night, I looked over and here's a strange guy comin' in. I'd never seen him before, so I asked one of the others, I say, </seg>
<seg id="33"> "John, you know this guy? You ever seen him?" So he looks. "No, I ain't never seen him before." </seg>
<seg id="34"> "I don't know who he is, but I know he's a tough-looking hombre." </seg>
<seg id="35"> So I looked over, and next thing, the guy had disappeared. </seg>
<seg id="36"> I don't know where he went to, but about this time, the music usually gets started. and I looked, and here's a colored guy, a colored boy playin' trumpet. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Man, he was playin' back. I looked at the guy and said "Well, my goodness. "He looks just like that gangster, but the gangster was white "and this guy is black." So I don't know what's... What's happening. </seg>
<seg id="38"> New York City. It is several months later. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Police are investigating the disappearance of a clerk named Leonard Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Both his landlady and his employer have reported him missing. </seg>
<seg id="41"> They tell police he was an odd little man who kept to himself. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Only two clues are found in Zelig's Greenwich Village flat. </seg>
<seg id="43"> One, a photograph of Zelig with Eugene O'Neill, and one of him as Pagliacci. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Acting on a tip, they trace his whereabouts to Chinatown, where, in the rear of a Chinese establishment, a strange-looking Oriental who fits the description of Leonard Zelig is discovered. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Suspicious, the detectives try to pull off his disguise, but it is not a disguise, and a fight breaks out. </seg>
<seg id="46"> He is removed by force, and taken to Manhattan Hospital. </seg>
<seg id="47"> In the ambulance, he rants and curses in what sounds like authentic Chinese. </seg>
<seg id="48"> He is restrained with a straitjacket. </seg>
<seg id="49"> When he emerges from the car incredibly, he is no longer Chinese, but Caucasian. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Bewildered interns place him in the emergency room for observation. </seg>
<seg id="51"> At 7:00 a.m., Dr. Eudora Fletcher, a psychiatrist, makes her usual rounds. </seg>
<seg id="52"> When I first heard about this emergency case that had been brought in, I didn't think anything peculiar. And when I first laid eyes on him, it was a bit strange, because I mistook him for a doctor. </seg>
<seg id="53"> He had a very professional demeanor about him. </seg>
<seg id="54"> As a young psychiatrist, Eudora Fletcher is fascinated by Leonard Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="55"> She convinces the conservative staff at the hospital to allow her to pursue a study of the new admission. </seg>
<seg id="56"> - What do you do? - Oh, me? I'm a psychiatrist. </seg>
<seg id="57"> - Oh, yes? - Yes, yes, I work mostly with delusional paranoids. </seg>
<seg id="58"> - Tell me about it. - Oh, there's not much to tell. I... </seg>
<seg id="59"> I work mostly on the Continent, and I've written quite a few psychoanalytic papers. </seg>
<seg id="60"> I've studied a great deal. I worked with Freud in Vienna. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Yes, we broke over the concept of penis envy. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Freud felt that it should be limited to women. </seg>
<seg id="63"> FLETCHER: It's not that he was making any sense at all. </seg>
<seg id="64"> It was just a conglomeration of psychological double-talk </seg>
<seg id="65"> that he had apparently heard, or perhaps was familiar with through reading. </seg>
<seg id="66"> The funny thing was that his delivery was quite fluid, and might have been really quite convincing to someone who did not know any better. </seg>
<seg id="67"> Who was this Leonard Zelig that seemed to create such diverse impressions everywhere? </seg>
<seg id="68"> All that was known of him was that he was the son of a Yiddish actor named Morris Zelig, whose performance as Puck in the Orthodox version of A Midsummer Night's Dream, was coolly received. </seg>
<seg id="69"> The elder Zelig's second marriage is marked by constant violent quarrelling, so much so, that although the family lives over a bowling alley, it is the bowling alley that complains of noise. </seg>
<seg id="70"> As a boy, Leonard is frequently bullied by anti-Semites. </seg>
<seg id="71"> His parents, who never take his part and blame him for everything, side with the anti-Semites. </seg>
<seg id="72"> They punish him often by locking him in a dark closet. </seg>
<seg id="73"> When they are really angry, they get into the closet with him. </seg>
<seg id="74"> On his deathbed, Morris Zelig tells his son that life is a meaningless nightmare of suffering, and the only advice he gives him is to save string. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Though brother Jack has a nervous breakdown, and sister Ruth becomes a shoplifter and alcoholic, Leonard Zelig appears to have adjusted to life. </seg>
<seg id="76"> Somehow, he seems to have coped. </seg>
<seg id="77"> And then, suddenly, increasingly strange behavior. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Fascinated by the Zelig phenomenon, Dr. Fletcher arranges a series of experiments and invites the skeptical staff to observe. </seg>
<seg id="79"> With the doctors watching, Zelig becomes a perfect psychiatrist. </seg>
<seg id="80"> When two Frenchmen are brought in, Zelig assumes their characters and speaks reasonable French. </seg>
<seg id="81"> In the company of a Chinese person, he begins to develop oriental features. </seg>
<seg id="82"> By now, word has gotten out to the press, and a public thirsting for thrills and novelty is immediately captivated. </seg>
<seg id="83"> The clamor is so great that Dr. Allan Sindell is forced to issue a statement. </seg>
<seg id="84"> We're just beginning to realize the dimensions of what could be the scientific medical phenomenon of the age, and possibly of all time. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Fresh stories roll off the press every day about Zelig and his puzzling condition. </seg>
<seg id="86"> Although the doctors claim to have the situation in hand, no two can agree on a diagnosis. </seg>
<seg id="87"> I'm convinced that it's glandular in nature and although there's no evidence now of any misfunction, I'm sure that further tests will show a problem in the secretions. </seg>
<seg id="88"> I'm certain it's something he picked up from eating Mexican food. </seg>
<seg id="89"> This manifestation is neurological in origin. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Now, this patient is suffering from a brain tumor, and I should not be surprised if, within several weeks, he died. </seg>
<seg id="91"> Now, we have not as yet been able to locate the tumor, but we're still looking. </seg>
<seg id="92"> Ironically, within two weeks' time, it is Dr. Birsky himself who dies of a brain tumor. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Leonard Zelig is fine. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Throughout the weeks of testing and speculation, Eudora Fletcher begins to feel that the patient might be suffering not from a physiological disorder, but from a psychological one. </seg>
<seg id="95"> It is Zelig's unstable make-up, she suggests, that accounts for his metamorphoses. </seg>
<seg id="96"> The governing board of doctors is hostile to her notion. </seg>
<seg id="97"> They conclude that Zelig's malady can be traced to poor alignment of the vertebrae. </seg>
<seg id="98"> Tests prove them wrong, and cause a temporary problem for the patient. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Now, the press and public hang on every bit of news, thoroughly absorbed in the real-life drama. </seg>
<seg id="100"> The continuing saga of the strange creature at Manhattan Hospital goes on. </seg>
<seg id="101"> This morning, doctors report, experiments were conducted and several women of varying types were placed in close proximity to the subject, but no change occurred, leading authorities to conclude that the phenomenon does not occur with women. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Later today, doctors will be experimenting with a midget and a chicken. </seg>
<seg id="103"> Leonard Zelig continues to astound scientists at New York's Manhattan Hospital, where numerous tests have led nowhere in determining the nature of this astonishing manifestation. </seg>
<seg id="104"> He is confronted by two overweight men at the request of the doctors. </seg>
<seg id="105"> As the men discuss their obesity, an initially reticent Zelig joins in, swelling himself to a miraculous 250 pounds. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Next, in the presence of two Negro men, </seg>
<seg id="107"> Zelig rapidly becomes one himself. </seg>
<seg id="108"> What will they think of next? </seg>
<seg id="109"> Meanwhile, Americans all over have their own reactions. </seg>
<seg id="110"> I wish I could be Lenny Zelig, the changing man. </seg>
<seg id="111"> I'd be different people, and maybe someday my wishes will come true. </seg>
<seg id="112"> Leonard Zelig is one of the finest gentlemen in the United States of America! </seg>
<seg id="113"> He is the cat's pajamas! </seg>
<seg id="114"> Tell me why you assume the characteristics of the person you're with. </seg>
<seg id="115"> It's safe. </seg>
<seg id="116"> What do you mean? What do you mean, "safe"? </seg>
<seg id="117"> Safe to... To be like the others. </seg>
<seg id="118"> You want to be safe? </seg>
<seg id="119"> I wanna be liked. </seg>
<seg id="120"> Probing Zelig's unconscious, Dr. Fletcher gradually puts together the pieces of Zelig's behavioral puzzle. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Dividing her time between the hospital and the 42nd Street library, she writes her report. </seg>
<seg id="122"> A closed meeting of doctors listens as Dr. Fletcher describes Zelig as "a human chameleon." </seg>
<seg id="123"> Like the lizard that is endowed by nature with a marvelous protective device that enables it to change color and blend in with its immediate surrounding, Zelig, too, protects himself by becoming whoever he is around. </seg>
<seg id="124"> The doctors listen, and their reaction is skeptical. </seg>
<seg id="125"> "Impossible!" they claim."Preposterous!" </seg>
<seg id="126"> "If he's a lizard," quips one doctor, "then we should not spend good hospital money feeding him, "but simply catch him some flies." </seg>
<seg id="127"> We knew we had a good story this time 'cause it had everything in it. It had romance and it had suspense. </seg>
<seg id="128"> And then this fella, Zelig, you know, he grew up poor. </seg>
<seg id="129"> I remember my city editor came to me. He said "Ted, we want this story on page one every day." </seg>
<seg id="130"> And in those days, you'd do anything to sell papers. </seg>
<seg id="131"> To get a story, you'd jazz it up, exaggerate, even maybe play with the truth a little bit. </seg>
<seg id="132"> But here was a story. It was a natural. </seg>
<seg id="133"> You just told the truth and it sold papers. It never happened before. </seg>
<seg id="134"> Overnight, Leonard Zelig has become the main topic of conversation everywhere, and is discussed with amusement and wonder. </seg>
<seg id="135"> No social gathering is without its Leonard Zelig joke, and in a decade of popular dance crazes, a new one sweeps the nation. </seg>
<seg id="136"> What's brown and white and yellow and has four eyes? </seg>
<seg id="137"> Leonard Zelig at the League of Nations. </seg>
<seg id="138"> NARRATOR: Not everyone, however, was entranced by the human chameleon, and amongst the fanatics, he was a handy symbol of iniquity. </seg>
<seg id="139"> This creature personifies capitalist man! </seg>
<seg id="140"> A creature who takes many forms to achieve ends, the exploitation of the workers by deception. </seg>
<seg id="141"> To the Ku Klux Klan, Zelig, a Jew who was able to transform himself into a Negro or Indian, was a triple threat. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Meanwhile, Dr. Fletcher, certain that her findings are correct, begs for time with her patient to put her theories into operation. </seg>
<seg id="143"> Do you recall the first time you began behaving like the people you were around? </seg>
<seg id="144"> In school, some very bright people asked me if I read Moby Dick. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Yes? I was ashamed to say I never read it. </seg>
<seg id="146"> - And you pretended? - Yes. </seg>
<seg id="147"> When did the changes begin happening automatically? </seg>
<seg id="148"> Years ago. St. Patrick's Day. </seg>
<seg id="149"> Wandered into a bar. Wasn't wearing green. </seg>
<seg id="150"> They made remarks. I turned Irish. </seg>
<seg id="151"> You told them you were Irish? </seg>
<seg id="152"> My hair turned red, my nose turned up. </seg>
<seg id="153"> Spoke about the great potato famine and the little people. </seg>
<seg id="154"> We do not agree with Dr. Fletcher's ideas. </seg>
<seg id="155"> We believe those ideas are pipe dreams. </seg>
<seg id="156"> We believe that any change in Zelig's condition is going to be brought about through certain experimental drugs, which, although risky, have been known to work wonders. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Zelig is treated with the experimental drug Somadril hydrate. </seg>
<seg id="158"> He undergoes severe mood changes, and for several days will not come off the wall. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Then, suddenly, as Dr. Fletcher is beginning to make some progress, the question of Zelig's fate takes a new twist as his half-sister, Ruth, shocks everyone by removing him from the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="160"> He can be better cared for at home, she tells the doctors. </seg>
<seg id="161"> He will be looked after, she explains, by her and her dubious-looking lover, Martin Geist, a businessman and ex-carnival promoter. </seg>
<seg id="162"> There is very little resistance amongst the doctors, who are relieved to be rid of the frustrating case. </seg>
<seg id="163"> Only Dr. Fletcher cares about Zelig as a human being. </seg>
<seg id="164"> She insists he desperately needs special care, but it is to no avail. </seg>
<seg id="165"> No, no one was questioning her legal right to Zelig, </seg>
<seg id="166"> I mean, she was his half-sister and his guardian, but she had a strange boyfriend called Geist </seg>
<seg id="167"> that... He'd been in jail for real-estate fraud. </seg>
<seg id="168"> He was selling the same piece of property to a lot of the same people, and... </seg>
<seg id="169"> Matter of fact, a congressman from Delaware bought it twice. </seg>
<seg id="170"> NARRATOR: The crowds that lined the roads to glimpse the human chameleon tie up traffic for days. </seg>
<seg id="171"> He is a sight to behold for tourists and children. </seg>
<seg id="172"> People from all over the country fight for space to peek at this new wonderment. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Selling mementos while her brother is allowed to be on exhibition is only the beginning for Ruth Zelig and Martin Geist. </seg>
<seg id="174"> Admission is charged to twice-daily demonstrations of Leonard's stunning prowess. </seg>
<seg id="175"> He does not disappoint, changing appearance over and over upon demand. </seg>
<seg id="176"> Overnight, he has become an attraction, a novelty, a freak. </seg>
<seg id="177"> In this 1935 film based on the life of Zelig, called The Changing Man, the atmosphere is best summed up. </seg>
<seg id="178"> We can't give up custody of Leonard. I know if I'm given the chance, I can cure him. </seg>
<seg id="179"> It's no use. Even our attorney says it's hopeless. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Really, Dr. Fletcher. Uh... May I call you Eudora? </seg>
<seg id="181"> I tell you, somewhere behind that vacuous face, that zombie-like stare, </seg>
<seg id="182"> is a real human being, and I can bring it out. </seg>
<seg id="183"> - How? - I'll think up some new way. </seg>
<seg id="184"> Some technique. Whatever it is, it'll have to be personal. </seg>
<seg id="185"> There's not much I can do legally. I'll try, but... </seg>
<seg id="186"> They don't care about him. They'll exploit him. </seg>
<seg id="187"> All they see in him is a chance to make more money. Look at this. </seg>
<seg id="188"> Already they're selling this Leonard Zelig doll. </seg>
<seg id="189"> The film did not exaggerate. There were not only Leonard Zelig pens and lucky charms, but clocks and toys. There were Leonard Zelig watches and books, and a famous Leonard Zelig doll. </seg>
<seg id="190"> There were aprons, chameleon-shaped earmuffs and a popular Leonard Zelig game. </seg>
<seg id="191"> There were many popular songs inspired by Leonard Zelig, tunes that swept the nation. </seg>
<seg id="192"> In addition to the products and endorsements, there are the endless exhibitions. </seg>
<seg id="193"> In Hollywood, he is a great favorite and is offered a film contract. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Clara Bow invites him for a private weekend, and tells him to bring all his personalities. </seg>
<seg id="195"> In Chicago, he meets heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey, who clowns with Zelig at his training camp. </seg>
<seg id="196"> In Washington, DC, he is introduced to both Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover. </seg>
<seg id="197"> In France he is hailed as "Le Lézard." He is the toast of the Parisian music halls. </seg>
<seg id="198"> His performance endears him as well to many leading French intellectuals, who see in him a symbol for everything. </seg>
<seg id="199"> His transformation into a rabbi is so realistic that certain Frenchmen suggest he be sent to Devil's Island. </seg>
<seg id="200"> At the Folies-Bergère, Josephine Baker does her version of the Chameleon dance, and later tells friends she finds Zelig amazing, but a little lost. </seg>
<seg id="201"> Everyone used to be at my place, that is, everyone who was someone. And occasionally, someone would bring Zelig in... Leonard in. </seg>
<seg id="202"> Cole Porter was fascinated by Leonard, and he once wrote a line in a song... </seg>
<seg id="203"> Uh..."You're the tops, you're Leonard Zelig." But then he couldn't find anything to rhyme with "Zelig." </seg>
<seg id="204"> I'm flyin' high 'Cause I've got a feelin' I'm fallin' Fallin' for nobody else but you </seg>
<seg id="205"> You caught my eye Now I got a feelin' I'm fallin' </seg>
<seg id="206"> Show me that ring and I'll jump right through </seg>
<seg id="207"> I used to travel single, oh We chanced to mingle, oh Now I'm a-tingle over you </seg>
<seg id="208"> Hey, Mr. Zelig, stand by 'Cause I've got a feelin' I'm fallin' Fallin' for nobody else but you, wow! </seg>
<seg id="209"> Though the shows and parties keep Zelig's sister and her lover rich and amused, Zelig's own existence is a nonexistence. </seg>
<seg id="210"> Devoid of personality, his human qualities long since lost in the shuffle of life, he sits alone, quietly staring into space, a cipher, a non-person, a performing freak. </seg>
<seg id="211"> He who wanted only to fit in, to belong, to go unseen by his enemies and be loved, neither fits in nor belongs, is supervised by enemies, and remains uncared for. </seg>
<seg id="212"> The board at the hospital has all but forgotten Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="213"> Only Dr. Fletcher continues to fight for his custody. </seg>
<seg id="214"> The court turns her final appeal down. </seg>
<seg id="215"> Throughout her valiant legal battle, she is frequently in the company of her attorney, Charles Koslow. </seg>
<seg id="216"> He falls in love with her and presses for her hand in marriage. </seg>
<seg id="217"> She is ambivalent. </seg>
<seg id="218"> Reluctantly, she is beginning to abandon all hope of recovering Leonard Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="219"> That summer, Geist has booked them in Spain. </seg>
<seg id="220"> It is the last leg of a European tour that has been wildly successful. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Relations between Martin Geist and Ruth Zelig have grown strained. </seg>
<seg id="222"> They have become bored with one another, and quarrel frequently. </seg>
<seg id="223"> The situation grows worse when she meets Luis Martinez, a mediocre and cowardly bullfighter with whom she falls in love. </seg>
<seg id="224"> Though he wishes to impress Ruth Zelig, </seg>
<seg id="225"> Martinez displays his usual panic in the arena. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Good fortune is with him, however, as the bull gives himself a brain concussion. </seg>
<seg id="227"> Martinez takes credit for the kill, and, cutting off the bull's ear, presents it to his lover with great bravado. </seg>
<seg id="228"> That evening, in a jealous rage, Martin Geist returns to his hotel room and confronts Ruth Zelig. He demands that she give him the ear. </seg>
<seg id="229"> She refuses. Geist insists upon possession of the ear. </seg>
<seg id="230"> They quarrel furiously, and Martinez is discovered hiding in the closet. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Geist pulls a revolver and shoots him. </seg>
<seg id="232"> He turns the gun on Zelig's half-sister and kills her, then he takes his own life. In an orgy of jealous violence, Leonard Zelig's life is turned upside down. </seg>
<seg id="233"> At first, the news reverberates around the world. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Then, just as quickly, the thrill-hungry public becomes apathetic. </seg>
<seg id="235"> Fresh scandals appear and make headlines. </seg>
<seg id="236"> Events in the Jazz Age move too rapidly, like Red Grange. </seg>
<seg id="237"> A population glutted with distractions is quick to forget. </seg>
<seg id="238"> The '20s come to a crashing climax, and still Leonard Zelig is nowhere to be found. </seg>
<seg id="239"> Dr. Eudora Fletcher searches in vain to locate him. When several leads prove disappointing, she gives up, discouraged. </seg>
<seg id="240"> I felt it was a shame, because here was this unique case that I could make my reputation on. </seg>
<seg id="241"> Not that I knew how to cure him, but if I could have him alone and feel my way and be innovative and creative, </seg>
<seg id="242"> I felt that I could change his life, if I only had the chance. </seg>
<seg id="243"> Borne on the shoulders of 12 attendants, </seg>
<seg id="244"> the seat of the gestatoria carrying the Holy Father is drawn out to the central balcony, where he bestows his blessing on Rome and all the world. </seg>
<seg id="245"> This is the first time that this ritual has been performed in 63 years, and brings to a climax on Easter Sunday the religious ceremonies of Holy Week. </seg>
<seg id="246"> Oh, but what's this? A commotion next to the Papal Father? </seg>
<seg id="247"> Somebody doesn't belong up there. </seg>
<seg id="248"> The guards are summoned amidst chaos, as His Holiness Pope Pius XI tries to swat the intruder with a sacred decree. </seg>
<seg id="249"> The faithful can't believe it. </seg>
<seg id="250"> It is, of course, Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="251"> He is returned to the United States by Italian authorities and readmitted to Manhattan Hospital. </seg>
<seg id="252"> "I welcome this opportunity to treat Leonard Zelig, "now that he's back as a ward of the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="253"> "I'm grateful that the board has given me this chance. </seg>
<seg id="254"> "I sincerely hope to return him to society a useful, self-possessed citizen "no longer a curiosity with no life of his own." </seg>
<seg id="255"> Dr. Fletcher has no time now to think of marriage. All her attention must be devoted to Leonard Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="256"> Her plan is to bring him to her country home. </seg>
<seg id="257"> She will set up a neutral environment away from society. </seg>
<seg id="258"> Here, she will begin searching for some new way to treat him in the hopes of penetrating his unique malady. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Aware of the significance of her work, </seg>
<seg id="260"> Eudora Fletcher arranges to keep a filmed record of the proceedings. </seg>
<seg id="261"> For this, she contacts her first cousin, Paul Deghuee, an inventor and part-time photographer. </seg>
<seg id="262"> And she said "I want to make a record of this case for future generations "and the world of science, </seg>
<seg id="263"> "and I want you to keep the camera very quiet." </seg>
<seg id="264"> And I said, "Why don't you just take notes and write it up?" </seg>
<seg id="265"> She said, "Paul, when a man changes his physical appearance, you want to see it. </seg>
<seg id="266"> "You can't read about it. Besides which, I am planning to make history." </seg>
<seg id="267"> The "White Room" is carefully arranged for maximum serenity. </seg>
<seg id="268"> It is a small study in Dr. Fletcher's house, sparsely furnished. </seg>
<seg id="269"> Clumsy photographic lights are nailed to the wall to provide sufficient illumination. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Microphones are hidden in specially selected places. </seg>
<seg id="271"> The camera shoots through a pane of glass which renders it relatively unobtrusive. </seg>
<seg id="272"> Only the noise of the motor is a problem, but this is muffled with a blanket and anything else handy. </seg>
<seg id="273"> From this cramped vantage point, photographer Paul Deghuee will record the famous "White Room Sessions, " a remarkable document in the history of psychotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="274"> By today's standards, the White Room Sessions would seem very primitive, and yet they were really quite effective in developing a very strong personal relation between doctor and patient. </seg>
<seg id="275"> The question whether Zelig was a psychotic or merely extremely neurotic was a question that was endlessly discussed among us doctors. </seg>
<seg id="276"> Now, I myself felt that, uh... His feelings were really not all that different from the normal, maybe what one would call the well-adjusted, normal person, only carried to an extreme degree, to an extreme extent. </seg>
<seg id="277"> I myself felt that one could really think of him as the ultimate conformist. </seg>
<seg id="278"> Leonard, do you know why you're here? </seg>
<seg id="279"> To discuss psychiatry, right? </seg>
<seg id="280"> You're a doctor? </seg>
<seg id="281"> Yes, I am. I am. Perhaps you've read my latest paper on delusional paranoia? </seg>
<seg id="282"> Turns out the entire thing is mental. </seg>
<seg id="283"> Now, suppose I tell you you're not a doctor. </seg>
<seg id="284"> Well, uh... I would say that you're making a joke. </seg>
<seg id="285"> Is it always so bright in here? </seg>
<seg id="286"> Oh, I'm recording these sessions on film, if you don't mind? </seg>
<seg id="287"> - No. Somebody's behind there, right? - Mmm-hmm. That's right. </seg>
<seg id="288"> - That's a camera. </seg>
<seg id="289"> Leonard... Leonard, why don't we start with simple reality? </seg>
<seg id="290"> - Leonard, you're not a doctor. - No? </seg>
<seg id="291"> No. You're a patient. I'm the doctor. </seg>
<seg id="292"> Well, I wouldn't tell that to too many people if I were you. </seg>
<seg id="293"> Leonard, you're not a doctor. </seg>
<seg id="294"> Is she gonna be all right? 'Cause... Is this a... </seg>
<seg id="295"> I've gotta get back to town. Really. I have an interesting case, treating two sets of Siamese twins with split personalities. I'm getting paid by eight people. </seg>
<seg id="296"> "The first week's sessions did not go too well, " writes Dr. Fletcher in her diary. </seg>
<seg id="297"> "Leonard identifies with me and is convinced that he is a doctor. </seg>
<seg id="298"> "He is guarded and suspicious. </seg>
<seg id="299"> "There is something appealing about him, too. He's quick-witted and energetic. </seg>
<seg id="300"> "Perhaps it is his very helplessness that moves me. </seg>
<seg id="301"> "I must keep flexible and play the situation by ear." </seg>
<seg id="302"> How are you today, Leonard? </seg>
<seg id="303"> Fine. And I... Uh... I gotta get back to town soon. You know, </seg>
<seg id="304"> I teach a course at the psychiatric institute in masturbation and... </seg>
<seg id="305"> - I see. - I'm a doctor, you know, and I... "Guilt-related masturbation." No, no, not guilt-related. I... I teach advanced. </seg>
<seg id="306"> - I'm quite a respected doctor there. - Leonard, I'd like you... ...eyes follow this pen and just let yourself breathe deeply. </seg>
<seg id="307"> - Why? What... - Relax. </seg>
<seg id="308"> No. You're trying to hypnotize me, obviously. </seg>
<seg id="309"> - Do you mind? - Of course I mind. I'm a doctor. I'm... </seg>
<seg id="310"> - Leonard, you're not a doctor. - I am a doctor! </seg>
<seg id="311"> - Just relax. - No, I can't. I'm... I'm due back in town. </seg>
<seg id="312"> I... I have this masturbation class. </seg>
<seg id="313"> If I'm not there, they start without me. </seg>
<seg id="314"> As the weeks go by, Dr. Fletcher grows more and more frustrated. </seg>
<seg id="315"> "Leonard continues to insist he is a doctor, "and even refuses to let me hypnotize him," she writes. </seg>
<seg id="316"> "I believe his experiences of the past year "have made him more defensive than ever. It is discouraging." </seg>
<seg id="317"> She was under great pressure, you could tell. She was moody and nervous. He was fine. Napping, sitting in his chair reading... He used to refer to himself as Dr. Zelig. He was reading books on psychiatry. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I told her "You'd better get away for a day and relax. "The strain is becoming too much for you." </seg>
<seg id="319"> Leaving Zelig alone, Dr. Fletcher takes Paul Deghuee's advice and she and her fiancé spend some hours off relaxing. </seg>
<seg id="320"> They go to Broadway, then to a well-known nightclub, where, despite a lively stage show, Dr. Fletcher is distracted and uneasy. </seg>
<seg id="321"> She is unable to think of anything but her patient. </seg>
<seg id="322"> The atmosphere with her fiancé, Koslow, is awkward and strained. </seg>
<seg id="323"> He is put off by her total obsession with Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Ironically, it is in the noisy and smoke-filled atmosphere of the nightclub that Eudora Fletcher is struck by a brilliant and innovative plan that will create a major breakthrough in the case. </seg>
<seg id="325"> - Dr. Zelig? - Yes? </seg>
<seg id="326"> I... I wonder if you could help me with a problem. </seg>
<seg id="327"> Well, I'll certainly try. Of course, we can't promise anything, you know. </seg>
<seg id="328"> You see, last week I was with a group of fairly erudite people who were discussing the novel Moby Dick, and I... I was afraid to admit that I hadn't read it, so I lied. </seg>
<seg id="329"> You see, I want so badly to be liked, to be like other people so that I don't stand out. </seg>
<seg id="330"> - That's natural. - I go to such extreme lengths to blend in. </seg>
<seg id="331"> Well... You're a doctor, you know? You... should know how to handle that. </seg>
<seg id="332"> No, but the truth of the matter is, I... I'm not an actual doctor. </seg>
<seg id="333"> - You're not? - No, Doctor. </seg>
<seg id="334"> No, I've... I've been pretending to be a doctor to fit in with my friends. </seg>
<seg id="335"> You see, they're doctors. </seg>
<seg id="336"> That's... That's something. </seg>
<seg id="337"> But you're a doctor, and you can help me. You have to help me. </seg>
<seg id="338"> Actually... I don't feel that well, actually. </seg>
<seg id="339"> But my... My whole life's just been a lie. </seg>
<seg id="340"> I've been posing as one thing after another. </seg>
<seg id="341"> Well, you... You need help, lady. Um... </seg>
<seg id="342"> Last night... Last night, I dreamt that I was falling into fire. </seg>
<seg id="343"> What does that mean? </seg>
<seg id="344"> That's terrible. I don't know. You know, I... Please, Doctor. I know I'm a very complicated patient. </seg>
<seg id="345"> - Jesus. I don't feel that well. - What am I suffering from? </seg>
<seg id="346"> How should I know? I'm not a doctor. </seg>
<seg id="347"> - You're not? - No. Am I? </seg>
<seg id="348"> - Who are you? - What do you mean, who am I? </seg>
<seg id="349"> - I don't know. These are tough questions. - Leonard Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="350"> - Yes, definitely. Who is he? - You. </seg>
<seg id="351"> No. I'm nobody. I'm nothing. </seg>
<seg id="352"> Catch me, I'm falling. </seg>
<seg id="353"> Playing on Zelig's identity disorder, </seg>
<seg id="354"> Dr. Fletcher has manipulated him into momentary disorientation. </seg>
<seg id="355"> With his guard lowered, she quickly puts him under hypnosis. </seg>
<seg id="356"> Using posthypnotic suggestion, she will now be able to induce a trance at will. </seg>
<seg id="357"> My brother beat me. </seg>
<seg id="358"> My sister beat my brother. </seg>
<seg id="359"> My father beat my sister and my brother and me. </seg>
<seg id="360"> My mother beat my father and my sister and me and my brother. </seg>
<seg id="361"> The neighbors beat our family. </seg>
<seg id="362"> People down the block beat the neighbors and our family. </seg>
<seg id="363"> I'm 12 years old. </seg>
<seg id="364"> I run into a synagogue. </seg>
<seg id="365"> I ask the rabbi the meaning of life. </seg>
<seg id="366"> He tells me the meaning of life, but he tells it to me in Hebrew. </seg>
<seg id="367"> I don't understand Hebrew. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Then he wants to charge me $600 for Hebrew lessons. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Dr. Fletcher's therapy consists of a two-pronged attack. </seg>
<seg id="370"> In the trance state, the personality will be deeply probed and then restructured. In the conscious state, she will provide love and affection, unconditional positive regard. </seg>
<seg id="371"> You will be completely honest. </seg>
<seg id="372"> You're in a deep trance. </seg>
<seg id="373"> You will become, not who you think I want you to be, but you'll be yourself. </seg>
<seg id="374"> Now, how do you feel about it here? </seg>
<seg id="375"> It's the worst. </seg>
<seg id="376"> I hate the country. </seg>
<seg id="377"> I hate the grass and the mosquitoes. </seg>
<seg id="378"> And cooking... Your cooking is terrible. </seg>
<seg id="379"> Your pancakes... </seg>
<seg id="380"> They're... I dump them in the garbage when you're not looking. </seg>
<seg id="381"> - Uh-huh. - And the jokes you try and tell when... When you think you're amusing, they're long and pointless, there's no end to them. </seg>
<seg id="382"> I see. And what else? </seg>
<seg id="383"> I wanna go to bed with you. </seg>
<seg id="384"> Oh... That surprises me. I didn't think you liked me very much. </seg>
<seg id="385"> I love you. </seg>
<seg id="386"> You do? </seg>
<seg id="387"> You're very sweet, 'cause you're... You're not as clever as you think you are. </seg>
<seg id="388"> You're all mixed up, and nervous, and you're the worst cook. </seg>
<seg id="389"> Those pancakes... </seg>
<seg id="390"> Oh, I love you. </seg>
<seg id="391"> I wanna take care of you. </seg>
<seg id="392"> No more pancakes. </seg>
<seg id="393"> I started out by trying to use Leonard to make my reputation, and then I found that I had very strong feelings for him. </seg>
<seg id="394"> I never thought I was attractive. </seg>
<seg id="395"> I never had a real romance. </seg>
<seg id="396"> Charles Koslow was the type of man my mother felt I should marry. </seg>
<seg id="397"> Feeling more confident every day with her patient, Dr. Fletcher takes him for a cautious outing, an afternoon at her sister's house in nearby Teaneck. </seg>
<seg id="398"> Meryl Fletcher is an aviatrix, a fine professional pilot. </seg>
<seg id="399"> Eudora Fletcher is an amateur pilot, and the afternoon is spent relaxing and retelling old flying experiences. </seg>
<seg id="400"> As the weeks pass, Zelig is encouraged to open up more and more, to give his own opinions. </seg>
<seg id="401"> What was guarded at first soon becomes expansive. </seg>
<seg id="402"> I hated my stepmother, and I don't care who knows it. </seg>
<seg id="403"> I love baseball. </seg>
<seg id="404"> You know, it doesn't have to mean anything, it's just very beautiful to watch. </seg>
<seg id="405"> I'm a Democrat. I always was a Democrat. </seg>
<seg id="406"> Is it okay if I don't agree with you about that recording? </seg>
<seg id="407"> Of course. I mean, Brahms is just always too melodramatic for me. </seg>
<seg id="408"> You have to be your own person and make your own moral choices, even when they do require real courage, otherwise you're like a robot, or a lizard. </seg>
<seg id="409"> Are you really gonna get married to that lawyer? </seg>
<seg id="410"> I... I would much rather you didn't. </seg>
<seg id="411"> No, I don't agree. I think this guy Mussolini is a loser. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Uh... Are we ever gonna make love? </seg>
<seg id="413"> It has been three months, and the board wishes to examine the patient. </seg>
<seg id="414"> Dr. Fletcher says Zelig is not ready to leave the premises. </seg>
<seg id="415"> The doctors agree to visit him there. </seg>
<seg id="416"> The date is set, four days hence. </seg>
<seg id="417"> If progress is insufficient, she will be removed from the case. </seg>
<seg id="418"> I was very nervous, because in his waking state he never remembered anything from his trance state, and I wondered if there could be some way of locking these two things together. </seg>
<seg id="419"> And then I also was worried that if he was with strong personalities, he might lose his personality. </seg>
<seg id="420"> Sunday at noon. The doctors arrive. </seg>
<seg id="421"> They are greeted by Eudora Fletcher and Leonard Zelig and are shown around the grounds. </seg>
<seg id="422"> Though Dr. Fletcher is tense and alert, </seg>
<seg id="423"> Leonard Zelig seems calm and at ease. </seg>
<seg id="424"> Despite the fact that he is surrounded by physicians, he does not turn into one. </seg>
<seg id="425"> The encounter appears to be a resounding success, when Dr. Henry Mayerson comments innocently about the weather, saying that it is a nice day. </seg>
<seg id="426"> Zelig tells Dr. Mayerson that he does not agree that it is a nice day. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Dr. Mayerson is taken aback at the firmness of Zelig's conviction. </seg>
<seg id="428"> He points out that the sun is shining and that it is mild. </seg>
<seg id="429"> Zelig, trained to voice his own personal opinions fearlessly, is too aggressive. He has been molded too far in the other direction. He has become over-opinionated, and cannot brook any disagreement with his own views. </seg>
<seg id="430"> I had taken him too far in the other direction. </seg>
<seg id="431"> He had struck Dr. Mayerson and several board members with a rake. </seg>
<seg id="432"> This was not what we wanted, and yet I felt that I had accomplished something. </seg>
<seg id="433"> I felt if I could have him for two more weeks, I could do some fine-tuning and turn Leonard Zelig back into his own man. </seg>
<seg id="434"> Dr. Eudora Nesbit Fletcher, the hero, or should we say heroine, of the hour. </seg>
<seg id="435"> The beautiful and brilliant psychiatrist never lost faith in her conviction that Leonard Zelig, the human chameleon, was suffering from a mental disorder. </seg>
<seg id="436"> Working with her cousin, cameraman Paul Deghuee, the doctor managed to keep a vital record of the proceedings including rare footage of Zelig hypnotized. </seg>
<seg id="437"> The patient and his healer have become fast friends in the process, and enjoy one another's company even when she's not working on him. </seg>
<seg id="438"> The result of maintaining a courageous minority opinion is a resounding success for psychiatry. </seg>
<seg id="439"> Who says women are just good for sewing? </seg>
<seg id="440"> Now it's on to City Hall, where the town's newest celebrities are given the key to the city. </seg>
<seg id="441"> We're honored to present this key to New York City to the two of you. </seg>
<seg id="442"> And, uh... Jimmy Walker did wanna be here this afternoon and sing Leonard the Lizard, but he was just too busy. </seg>
<seg id="443"> After City Hall, Eudora Fletcher, the beautiful genius who cured Zelig of his science-defying condition, is honored by fellow scientists at New York's Waldorf-Astoria. </seg>
<seg id="444"> Present are luminaries from all over the world, not just in the field of psychiatry, but physics, biology, mathematics, and you name it. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Here she is exchanging theories with Nils Andersen, the father of modern blood disease. </seg>
<seg id="446"> Later in the week, Dr. Fletcher is again honored by the greatest city in the world, as she gets to christen her first ship. </seg>
<seg id="447"> Quite a success story for a little girl from the backwoods. </seg>
<seg id="448"> I'm speaking to you from the home of Mrs. Catherine Fletcher. She's the mother of Dr. Eudora Fletcher, the famous psychiatrist so much in the news these days. </seg>
<seg id="449"> And I'm going to be asking Mrs. Fletcher to... To begin with, to tell us something about what it's like to raise a medical genius. And I might ask you about the many sacrifices that you've made to put your daughter through medical school. </seg>
<seg id="450"> And could you speak right into the microphones, please? </seg>
<seg id="451"> Sacrifices, we had none. John was a stockbroker, he had plenty of money, and I came from a wealthy Philadelphia family, so... </seg>
<seg id="452"> Well, I'm sure that your daughter always wanted to be a doctor, ever since she could remember. </seg>
<seg id="453"> I don't think so. </seg>
<seg id="454"> I always thought she'd want to be a flier like her sister Meryl and raise a family. - But she was a very moody... - But still, a mother always dreams for her child to have the kind of success that your daughter has. </seg>
<seg id="455"> - She was a very difficult girl. - Well, tell me about your husband. </seg>
<seg id="456"> I understand that he is a simple businessman. </seg>
<seg id="457"> He must be so thrilled and pleased </seg>
<seg id="458"> to have his daughter achieve such recognition. </seg>
<seg id="459"> John had problems, depression. He drank. </seg>
<seg id="460"> Well, Mrs. Fletcher, thank you so much for speaking with us today. </seg>
<seg id="461"> Here at San Simeon, glorious dreamland of newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst, celebrities from all walks of society, sun or play. </seg>
<seg id="462"> There's Marie Dressler with Mr. Hearst. Always a popular guest at San Simeon, </seg>
<seg id="463"> Miss Dressler accepts a flower from an ardent admirer. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Along with her is Marion Davies. </seg>
<seg id="465"> When she works, Miss Davies is always dead serious, but here at this fabulous playground, she shows us her fun side. </seg>
<seg id="466"> There she is with you-know-who, Charlie Chaplin, always kidding. </seg>
<seg id="467"> Although New York is 3,000 miles away, </seg>
<seg id="468"> Jimmy Walker somehow appears through Mr. Hearst's enchanted gateway. </seg>
<seg id="469"> Another New Yorker is Leonard Zelig, here shown clowning with everybody's favorite cowboy, Tom Mix. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Won't Tony be jealous? </seg>
<seg id="471"> Tony is Tom's horse, and we always thought they went everywhere together. </seg>
<seg id="472"> There's that fellow Chaplin again, this time with Adolphe Menjou. </seg>
<seg id="473"> There's Claire Windsor and Dolores del Rio, and a very charming Eudora Fletcher chatting with Hollywood's newest dancing sensation, James Cagney. </seg>
<seg id="474"> Oh, and what have we here? </seg>
<seg id="475"> Only a beautiful lady named Carole Lombard. </seg>
<seg id="476"> And there's Dr. Fletcher and Leonard Zelig hitting a few with Bobby Jones on Mr. Hearst's golf course. </seg>
<seg id="477"> Unless Leonard can go back to his old chameleon personality and turn into a golf pro, I'd bet my money on Bobby. </seg>
<seg id="478"> But who cares, if they're having fun? </seg>
<seg id="479"> Leonard Zelig, do you want to give the kids of this country some advice? </seg>
<seg id="480"> I sure do. Kids, you gotta be yourself. You know, you can't act like anybody else just because you think that they have all the answers and you don't. </seg>
<seg id="481"> You have to be your own man and learn to speak up and say what's on your mind. </seg>
<seg id="482"> Now, maybe they're not free to do that in foreign countries, but that's the American way. </seg>
<seg id="483"> And you can take it from me, because I used to be a member of the reptile family, but I'm not anymore. </seg>
<seg id="484"> Zelig, no longer a chameleon, is at last his own man. </seg>
<seg id="485"> His point of view on politics, art, life and love is honest and direct. </seg>
<seg id="486"> Though his taste is described by many as lowbrow, it is his own. </seg>
<seg id="487"> He is finally an individual, a human being. </seg>
<seg id="488"> He no longer gives up his own identity to be a safe and invisible part of his surroundings. </seg>
<seg id="489"> Oh, his taste wasn't terrible. </seg>
<seg id="490"> He was the kind of man who preferred watching baseball to reading Moby Dick. And that got him off on the wrong foot, or so the legend goes. </seg>
<seg id="491"> It was much more a matter of symbolism. To the Marxists, he was one thing. </seg>
<seg id="492"> The Catholic Church never forgave him for the Vatican incident. </seg>
<seg id="493"> The American people, in the throes of the Depression as they were, found in him a symbol of possibility, of self-improvement and self-fulfillment. </seg>
<seg id="494"> And of course, the Freudians had a ball. They could interpret him in any way they pleased. </seg>
<seg id="495"> It was all symbolism, but there were no two intellectuals who agreed about what it meant. </seg>
<seg id="496"> I don't know if you could call it a triumph of psychotherapy. It seems more like a triumph of aesthetic instincts, because Dr. Fletcher's techniques didn't owe anything to then-current schools of therapy. </seg>
<seg id="497"> But she sensed what was needed and she provided it, and that was, in its way, a remarkable creative accomplishment. </seg>
<seg id="498"> When I think about it, it seems to me that his story reflected a lot of the Jewish experience in America, the great urge to push in and to find one's place and then to assimilate into the culture. </seg>
<seg id="499"> I mean, he wanted to assimilate like crazy. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Eudora Fletcher's life has also changed from this experience. </seg>
<seg id="501"> For her, fame and recognition are empty rewards and do not live up to the adolescent fantasies that prompted her ambition. </seg>
<seg id="502"> She and her patient have fallen in love, and it is no surprise when she forsakes the upwardly mobile attorney Koslow and announces wedding plans with Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="503"> It was wonderful to see my sister and Leonard together. </seg>
<seg id="504"> She drew strength from him, and they were so much in love with each other. She looked happier than she had in years. </seg>
<seg id="505"> I remember they decided to get married in the spring, and then, of course, the roof fell in. </seg>
<seg id="506"> Two weeks before the wedding, an ex-showgirl named Lita Fox comes forth and claims that she is married to Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="507"> She also claims to have had his child. </seg>
<seg id="508"> It is an immediate scandal. </seg>
<seg id="509"> We were married a year ago. He said he was an actor. </seg>
<seg id="510"> He sounded just like one, and I'm in show business, too. </seg>
<seg id="511"> So we drove to Baltimore and we were married, and I have a license to prove it. </seg>
<seg id="512"> He had married her while under a different personality. </seg>
<seg id="513"> When she read of the plans for his forthcoming wedding to Eudora Fletcher, she was mortified and decided to take legal action. </seg>
<seg id="514"> Zelig says he will fight it in court, but public opinion begins subtly to shift away from him. </seg>
<seg id="515"> Clever attorneys portray Lita Fox as an abandoned woman. </seg>
<seg id="516"> The child is neglected, poor and fatherless. </seg>
<seg id="517"> Zelig has sold his life story to Hollywood for a large sum of money. </seg>
<seg id="518"> When the scandal breaks, the studio demands its money back. </seg>
<seg id="519"> Zelig can only return half as the rest has already been spent. </seg>
<seg id="520"> Outraged, the studio gives him half his life back. They keep the best moments, and he is left with only his sleeping hours and mealtimes. </seg>
<seg id="521"> Zelig is shaken by the scandal, but it is only the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="522"> Now another woman steps forward. Helen Gray, a salesgirl from a Wisconsin gift shop claims that Zelig is the father of her twins. </seg>
<seg id="523"> She tells her lawyers that he passed himself off as a fur trapper. </seg>
<seg id="524"> Zelig has no recollection, but admits it could have happened when he was under one of his spells. </seg>
<seg id="525"> It is the signal for the floodgates to open. </seg>
<seg id="526"> He married me up at the First Church of Harlem. </seg>
<seg id="527"> He told me he was the brother of Duke Ellington. </seg>
<seg id="528"> He was the guy who smashed my car up. It was brand-new. </seg>
<seg id="529"> Then he backed up over my mother's wrist. </seg>
<seg id="530"> She's elderly, and uses her wrist a lot. </seg>
<seg id="531"> He painted my house a disgusting color. He said he was a painter. I couldn't believe the results. Then he disappeared. </seg>
<seg id="532"> That Zelig could be responsible for the behavior of each of the personalities he assumed means dozens of lawsuits. </seg>
<seg id="533"> He is sued for bigamy, adultery, automobile accidents, plagiarism, household damages, negligence, property damages, and performing unnecessary dental extractions. </seg>
<seg id="534"> I would like to apologize to everyone. </seg>
<seg id="535"> I'm awfully sorry for marrying all those women. </seg>
<seg id="536"> It just... I don't know, it just seemed like the thing to do. </seg>
<seg id="537"> And to the gentleman whose appendix I took out, I'm... I don't know what to say. </seg>
<seg id="538"> If it's any consolation, I may still have it somewhere around the house. </seg>
<seg id="539"> My deepest apology goes to the Trokman family in Detroit. </seg>
<seg id="540"> I... I never delivered a baby before in my life, and I, I just thought that ice tongs was the way to do it. </seg>
<seg id="541"> Thriving mercilessly on loopholes and technicalities, the American legal profession has a field day. </seg>
<seg id="542"> Zelig is branded a criminal. Despite Dr. Fletcher's insistence that he cannot be held responsible for his actions while in his chameleon state, it is no use. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Leonard Zelig sets a bad moral influence. America is a moral country. It's a God-fearing country. </seg>
<seg id="544"> We don't condone scandals, scandals of fraud and polygamy. </seg>
<seg id="545"> In keeping with a pure society, I say lynch the little Hebe! </seg>
<seg id="546"> Throughout the humiliating ordeal, Eudora Fletcher stands by the man she loves, valiantly. </seg>
<seg id="547"> Privately, she tells friends that she is worried about Zelig's emotional condition, which seems to her to be deteriorating under the weight of conservative moral opinion. </seg>
<seg id="548"> In public, he tries to keep up an appearance of composure, but it is increasingly difficult. </seg>
<seg id="549"> It is clear he is coming apart when he and Eudora Fletcher dine at a Greek restaurant, and in the midst of the meal, Zelig begins to turn Greek. </seg>
<seg id="550"> He longs desperately to be liked once again, to be accepted, to fit in. </seg>
<seg id="551"> Public clamor over his morality reaches a fever pitch, and on the eve of his sentencing, Leonard Zelig vanishes. </seg>
<seg id="552"> This is Chief Inspector of Police Thomas Dowd with a national broadcasting news break. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Leonard Zelig is missing. On the eve of his sentencing for an assortment of crimes and misdemeanors ranging from polygamy to fraud, he has disappeared. </seg>
<seg id="554"> We are searching for clues and would appreciate speaking with anyone who might have any information leading to his apprehension. </seg>
<seg id="555"> My sister was just shattered. </seg>
<seg id="556"> She tried, you know, she tried to keep up a calm front but she was just too upset. </seg>
<seg id="557"> And she wasn't a person who usually displayed emotion easily, except where Leonard was concerned. </seg>
<seg id="558"> Dr. Fletcher and the police confer daily. Together they make public appeals to anyone who might know of his whereabouts. </seg>
<seg id="559"> Apart from several crank telephone calls, there is little response. </seg>
<seg id="560"> Months go by and Zelig is not heard from. </seg>
<seg id="561"> Cars are searched. False leads pour in from everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="562"> His jacket is recovered in Texas. A manhunt in that state proves futile. </seg>
<seg id="563"> He is reported seen in Chicago, in California. </seg>
<seg id="564"> This still photo appears to have a man resembling him with a mariachi band in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="565"> Dr. Fletcher continues to search for Zelig, but hopes fade with each passing day. </seg>
<seg id="566"> All I could think of was Leonard and how much I missed him and loved him, and of all the terrific times we'd spent together. </seg>
<seg id="567"> It was really a very painful time for me. </seg>
<seg id="568"> The year ends, and Zelig is still missing. </seg>
<seg id="569"> I just moped around and wept. </seg>
<seg id="570"> And one night, after a very bad time, my sister Meryl said to me, "Come on, let's go out for dinner. "Let's go to a concert." I said, "No, I can't do it." But she insisted. </seg>
<seg id="571"> And we went out and finally ended up in a movie. </seg>
<seg id="572"> We saw Grand Hotel and with it, there was a newsreel. </seg>
<seg id="573"> Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist Party continue to consolidate gains in Depression-ridden Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="574"> Denouncing the Treaty of Versailles, the Nazis make fervent appeals to German patriotism, promising to rebuild... </seg>
<seg id="575"> Eudora Fletcher is stunned by what she sees. </seg>
<seg id="576"> Amongst the Brownshirts, she spots a figure who could be Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="577"> Yes, but then it really made sense, it made all the sense in the world, because although he wanted to be loved, craved to be loved, there was also something in him that desired immersion in the mass and anonymity, and fascism offered Zelig that kind of opportunity. So he could make something anonymous of himself by belonging to this vast movement. </seg>
<seg id="578"> She sails for Europe the following week. Ten days later, she arrives in Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="579"> Germany is a country deep in the throes of the Depression. </seg>
<seg id="580"> Militarism and unrest are in the air. </seg>
<seg id="581"> She searches everywhere and makes enquiries, but it is impossible. </seg>
<seg id="582"> After three weeks, the authorities begin to get suspicious. </seg>
<seg id="583"> They watch her. While she is out, they search her hotel room. </seg>
<seg id="584"> A fourth week goes by, and she is about to give up and go home, when news of a large rally at Munich catches her attention. </seg>
<seg id="585"> It is rumored that it will be the largest gathering to date of Nazi personnel. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Eudora Fletcher is counting on the hope that Zelig may also attend. And that if she can confront him, the strong feeling he has always had for her can be awakened. </seg>
<seg id="587"> At first, all appears hopeless. The crowd is huge, and it seems impossible to locate any one particular face. Then, suddenly, a figure flanking the Chancellor captures her attention. </seg>
<seg id="588"> Behind and to the right of Hitler, she spots Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Struggling to make contact, she manages to catch his eye. </seg>
<seg id="590"> Like a man emerging from a dream, Zelig notices her. </seg>
<seg id="591"> In a matter of seconds, everything comes back to him. </seg>
<seg id="592"> It was nothing like it happened in the movie. </seg>
<seg id="593"> When Leonard came down from the podium, they didn't know what to think. </seg>
<seg id="594"> We couldn't believe our eyes. Hitler's speech was ruined. </seg>
<seg id="595"> He wanted to make a good joke about Poland, but just then, Zelig interfered and Hitler was extremely upset. </seg>
<seg id="596"> The SS wanted to grab Zelig, but if they would have grabbed him, they probably would have tortured him, or maybe even shot him. </seg>
<seg id="597"> In the confusion, Fletcher and Zelig got out of the building through a side door. </seg>
<seg id="598"> They grabbed a car. They sped away in the car, and the SS after them, shot them... </seg>
<seg id="599"> In rare German newsreel footage, a quick glimpse of the escape was recorded. </seg>
<seg id="600"> I was flying! It was wonderful. And then... Suddenly, something happened. I was frightened. I lost control. We went into a dive. </seg>
<seg id="601"> Leonard was so terrified that he changed his personality, and before my eyes, because I was a pilot, he turned into one, too. </seg>
<seg id="602"> Zelig takes control of the airplane. Acting the role of pilot, he struggles valiantly with the aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="603"> The Germans, who are stunned, take a full 15 minutes before they follow in hot pursuit of their quarry. </seg>
<seg id="604"> With Eudora Fletcher unconscious, Zelig, who had never flown before in his life, not only escapes the German pilots, but sets a record for flying nonstop across the Atlantic upside down. </seg>
<seg id="605"> New York welcomes back Eudora Fletcher and Leonard Zelig, the human chameleon. </seg>
<seg id="606"> His remarkable feat of aviation fills the nation with pride and earns him a full presidential pardon. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Forgiving multitudes flock to see him as he sits by the side of his plucky bride-to-be. </seg>
<seg id="608"> Their journey of triumph leads to City Hall. </seg>
<seg id="609"> New York's greatest honor, the Medal of Valor, is bestowed on Zelig by Carter Dean. </seg>
<seg id="610"> You are a great inspiration to the young of this nation who will one day grow up and be great doctors and great patients. </seg>
<seg id="611"> This is a great thrill. </seg>
<seg id="612"> I'm glad we lived to see this day. </seg>
<seg id="613"> I've never flown before in my life, and it shows exactly what you can do if you're a total psychotic. </seg>
<seg id="614"> The thing was paradoxical, because what enabled him to perform this astounding feat was his ability to transform himself. </seg>
<seg id="615"> Therefore, his sickness was also at the root of his salvation, and I think it's interesting to view the thing that way, that it was his very disorder that made a hero of him. </seg>
<seg id="616"> It was really absurd in a way. </seg>
<seg id="617"> I mean, he had this curious quirk, this strange characteristic, and for a time, everyone loved him, and then people stopped loving him, and then he did this stunt, you know, with the airplane, and then everybody loved him again, and that was what the '20s were like. </seg>
<seg id="618"> When you think about it, has America changed so much? I don't think so. </seg>
<seg id="619"> After untangling countless legal details, </seg>
<seg id="620"> Leonard Zelig and Eudora Fletcher marry. </seg>
<seg id="621"> It is a simple ceremony, captured on home movies. </seg>
<seg id="622"> "Wanting only to be liked, he distorted himself beyond measure, " wrote Scott Fitzgerald. </seg>
<seg id="623"> "One wonders what would have happened if, right at the outset, "he had had the courage to speak his mind and not pretend. </seg>
<seg id="624"> "In the end it was, after all, "not the approbation of many, but the love of one woman that changed his life." </seg>
