<seg id="1"> On January 11 at 2:30 pm ... </seg>
<seg id="2"> This is our memory, then you will do yours. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Following a bombardment at Brooklyn Bridge Park ... </seg>
<seg id="4"> Zachary Cowan, 11, armed with a stick, ... </seg>
<seg id="5"> He hit our son, Ethan Longstreet, in the face. </seg>
<seg id="6"> (Pen) This gesture, in addition to the swelling of the upper lip, ... </seg>
<seg id="7"> He caused the breaks of the two incisors ... </seg>
<seg id="8"> .. and compromised the nerve of the right incisor. </seg>
<seg id="9"> - Armed? </seg>
<seg id="10"> - Do not you like "armed"? </seg>
<seg id="11"> Michael, how can you say, "What's a stick?" </seg>
<seg id="12"> - "What had" ... yeah. - "What a Stick!" </seg>
<seg id="13"> - "Which had"... </seg>
<seg id="14"> We thought the Brooklyn Bridge Park was more secure than Hillside. </seg>
<seg id="15"> We've always said, "The Brooklyn Bridge Park is fine, Hillside no." </seg>
<seg id="16"> - Unbelievable! </seg>
<seg id="17"> Thank you for coming ... </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is much better not to let yourself be carried away by your own emotionality. </seg>
<seg id="19"> We are thanking you. </seg>
<seg id="20"> We do not have to thank each other for each other. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Fortunately, there is still an idea of ​​civil coexistence, is not it? </seg>
<seg id="22"> Yeah, even if our children have not grabbed the concept well. </seg>
<seg id="23"> -Also, not ours. -Our ... not ours! </seg>
<seg id="24"> Those tulips are gorgeous. </seg>
<seg id="25"> I took them from the florist on top of Henry. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Sure! </seg>
<seg id="27"> It makes them come from Holland, </seg>
<seg id="28"> - Cheap. - SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Did you understand what it is? - Sure. </seg>
<seg id="30"> What will happen to the tooth with compromised nerve? </seg>
<seg id="31"> You do not know yet. At present, the prognosis has not been dissolved. </seg>
<seg id="32"> It seems that the nerve ... is not completely uncovered. </seg>
<seg id="33"> - It's only partially. - (Pen) There is a discovery and a protected part. </seg>
<seg id="34"> - Do not devalue them for now. - So the tooth can heal. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Yeah, to avoid a canal cure. </seg>
<seg id="36"> -Of course! For a while, they will keep the nerve in sight. </seg>
<seg id="37"> - They will put capsules on it ... - No plants up to 18 years old. </seg>
<seg id="38"> - You can not. </seg>
<seg id="39"> You can only put it at the end of development. </seg>
<seg id="40"> It's natural. Well, we hope everything goes for the best. </seg>
<seg id="41"> We can only hope. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Listen ... Ethan ... did not want to accuse Zachary. </seg>
<seg id="43"> No, he did not want to! </seg>
<seg id="44"> It was amazing to see this disfigured little boy, with no teeth, ... </seg>
<seg id="45"> .. who refused to speak. </seg>
<seg id="46"> I can imagine. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Well, in truth, he did not want to go by spy, it was not just a sense of honor! </seg>
<seg id="48"> Honor requires a suitable social environment. </seg>
<seg id="49"> How did you get the name of Zachary? </seg>
<seg id="50"> We explained to Ethan that, protecting him, he would not have helped. </seg>
<seg id="51"> We told him: "If he lets him beat others, he will continue." </seg>
<seg id="52"> If we were the parents of that child, we would have wanted to know it. </seg>
<seg id="53"> - Obviously. - SÃƒÂ¬. Excuse me for a moment. </seg>
<seg id="54"> SÃƒÂ¬, Walter? Thank you for recalling me. </seg>
<seg id="55"> It's on the "Journal" this morning, I read it. </seg>
<seg id="56"> "According to a study published in 'Lancet ... there have been some neurological side effects ... of Antril, the drug against hypertension ... ranging from lowering hearing to atassia." </seg>
<seg id="57"> Who the hell is holding the print, huh? </seg>
<seg id="58"> Yeah, you're in shit. </seg>
<seg id="59"> The problem is that the general shareholders' meeting is in two weeks </seg>
<seg id="60"> - Sorry. - So she's ... - Lawyer. </seg>
<seg id="61"> - And you, on the other hand? -Thanking home articles. </seg>
<seg id="62"> - She is a writer and works part-time in an art library. </seg>
<seg id="63"> - Writer! </seg>
<seg id="64"> I participated in a collective work on Saba and her civilization, ... </seg>
<seg id="65"> ... from the recovery of the excavations after the war between Eritrea and Ethiopia. </seg>
<seg id="66"> But now I'm working on a book on Darfur's tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="67"> - An expert in Africa. </seg>
<seg id="68"> - I'm interested in that part of the world. </seg>
<seg id="69"> Do you have other children? -SÃ¬, Courtney, nine years old. </seg>
<seg id="70"> (Pen) She has her with her father because she has been released from the hamster yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="71"> - Is he released from the hamster? -SÃƒÂ¬! It was very loud at night. </seg>
<seg id="72"> They sleep in the daytime. </seg>
<seg id="73"> Ethan was hysterical, he could not bear the whole chaos. </seg>
<seg id="74"> Actually, I too could not wait to get rid of it. </seg>
<seg id="75"> I caught it and I dropped it in the street. </seg>
<seg id="76"> - Did you give it up in the street? - I thought they were sewage animals! </seg>
<seg id="77"> ln reality, on the sidewalk, that thing was petrified! </seg>
<seg id="78"> They are not wild or domestic, you do not know where to throw them! </seg>
<seg id="79"> So she ... abandoned him out there? </seg>
<seg id="80"> Yeah, and she tried to let Courtney believe she had run away. </seg>
<seg id="81"> she did not believe it. </seg>
<seg id="82"> - And this morning, the hamster was "gone". - That's right. </seg>
<seg id="83"> - What do you do about it? - They are a financial operator. </seg>
<seg id="84"> Um ... let me make a direct question. </seg>
<seg id="85"> - Zachary can apologize to Ethan? </seg>
<seg id="86"> - Sure. They have to meet. </seg>
<seg id="87"> You have to apologize, Alan! If nothing else, you must say he is sorry. </seg>
<seg id="88"> - It is probable. - Ma Ã¨ cosÃƒÂ¬? Are you sorry? </seg>
<seg id="89"> She does not realize the gravity of her gesture, she's only 11 years old. </seg>
<seg id="90"> - At age 11 there are no more children. - But not adults! </seg>
<seg id="91"> Do you want a cafe or a tea? </seg>
<seg id="92"> Was it a bit of fruit cake? Make a cake crazy! </seg>
<seg id="93"> - Can I have an espresso? - Sure. - I would like. </seg>
<seg id="94"> - A glass of water. - Also for me an espresso and bring the cake! Come. </seg>
<seg id="95"> Please make yourselves comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="96"> - Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="97"> You have to taste that cake! </seg>
<seg id="98"> Where's the cake? </seg>
<seg id="99"> He put it back in the fridge. In what language do I have to speak to that woman? </seg>
<seg id="100"> - What a lovely couple. - Very. </seg>
<seg id="101"> - They're cute, right? - Do you tell everyone I'm a writer? </seg>
<seg id="102"> - You did, you wrote a book! </seg>
<seg id="103"> It's not easy to make a good fruit cake. </seg>
<seg id="104"> - What does it sell? - Ornamental items: locks, handles, copper objects. And kitchen utensils: pots and pans. </seg>
<seg id="105"> And do you earn well? "I have not had particularly exciting years. At first it was tough. </seg>
<seg id="106"> ..I am going out every morning with the sample and the catalog, field! </seg>
<seg id="107"> - Cast iron pans have a peak at Christmas. </seg>
<seg id="108"> When did he see the scared hamster, why did not he bring him home? </seg>
<seg id="109"> - I do not touch them like that. - He put it on the sidewalk. </seg>
<seg id="110"> It was in the box, I dropped it. I can not really touch them. </seg>
<seg id="111"> - Sugar? - No, no sugar. </seg>
<seg id="112"> - What fruit put into the cake? - Apples and pears. </seg>
<seg id="113"> - Apples and pears? - SÃƒÂ¬. It's my little recipe. </seg>
<seg id="114"> - Apples and pears ... It's a novelty for me. </seg>
<seg id="115"> - It's a classic, but there is a secret. - Oh, really? </seg>
<seg id="116"> You have to cut the largest pears of apples, because they bake before. </seg>
<seg id="117"> - Oh, here! - It's not the real secret. - Let's taste it! </seg>
<seg id="118"> - Really good. - Exquisite. - Crushed gingerbread. </seg>
<seg id="119"> - Oh God! - It's the original recipe, just a little more elaborate. - He gave me his mother. </seg>
<seg id="120"> - Gingerbread! Fantastic. </seg>
<seg id="121"> At least, this trouble made us discover a new recipe. </seg>
<seg id="122"> If my son did not give us two teeth it was better. </seg>
<seg id="123"> - That was what I meant. -It is a way of expressing it. </seg>
<seg id="124"> I'm sorry. </seg>
<seg id="125"> SÃƒÂ¬, Walter? </seg>
<seg id="126"> No, no letter to the director. </seg>
<seg id="127"> We do not burn controversy. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Do you have coverage? So?! </seg>
<seg id="129"> What kind of disturbances are there? What is the atassia? </seg>
<seg id="130"> And with normal doses? </seg>
<seg id="131"> How far do you know it? Why did not you retreat, then? </seg>
<seg id="132"> Which business tour is it about? Oh, I understand! </seg>
<seg id="133"> - Alan? We are waiting. - I'll come in for a moment. </seg>
<seg id="134"> Dennis? </seg>
<seg id="135"> They were aware of the risks for two and a half years. </seg>
<seg id="136"> An internal communication, where side effects are not specified. No precautionary measure, no coverage, and no annual report. </seg>
<seg id="137"> Lack of balance, slow motion in practice, you move like a drunk. </seg>
<seg id="138"> About half a billion of turnover. </seg>
<seg id="139"> You are there? </seg>
<seg id="140"> Deny! </seg>
<seg id="141"> That whimper wanted to write to the editor of the newspaper. </seg>
<seg id="142"> You do not write to any newspaper. </seg>
<seg id="143"> Anyway, in the event of a reaction, we will release a statement, such as "False voices circulate two weeks from the General Assembly". </seg>
<seg id="144"> No, he reminds me so much. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Ok. </seg>
<seg id="146"> - Today I could not have lunch. </seg>
<seg id="147"> - Oh, serve it as well! Take. </seg>
<seg id="148"> - Here it is. </seg>
<seg id="149"> I know it's not the way to behave. We were saying? </seg>
<seg id="150"> We said it would be better to know us in different circumstances. </seg>
<seg id="151"> - So this cake is her mother? - His mother! </seg>
<seg id="152"> The recipe is my mother, but Pen has made it. </seg>
<seg id="153"> - Your mother does not use apples and pears. - No. </seg>
<seg id="154"> - It's about to be operated. - Oh, what? </seg>
<seg id="155"> - To the knee. </seg>
<seg id="156"> They will put a rotary polyethylene and metal denture. </seg>
<seg id="157"> And she wants to know what will remain after the cremation! </seg>
<seg id="158"> Do not be naughty. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Instead of being buried near my father, he wants to be cremated and brought to the north, near the mother, who is alone. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A pair of urns chatting infinitely over the banks of a lake. </seg>
<seg id="161"> We are very impressed with your availability. </seg>
<seg id="162"> We know you want to make things easier, instead of exasperating them. </seg>
<seg id="163"> - It's the least we can do. - SÃƒÂ¬! </seg>
<seg id="164"> There are so many parents who take the children's part, becoming more infant than they are. </seg>
<seg id="165"> If Ethan had broken two teeth at Zachary, maybe we would have reacted badly. </seg>
<seg id="166"> - What if we had your width of views? - Yes, yes. </seg>
<seg id="167"> - I doubt it. - Yeah, because we could've been in your place. </seg>
<seg id="168"> What does Zachary say about this story? How did he get it? </seg>
<seg id="169"> Does not say much, I think it's confused. </seg>
<seg id="170"> - Do you realize you've disfigured a companion? </seg>
<seg id="171"> No! No, you do not realize you have ... "disfigured" your companion! </seg>
<seg id="172"> Why do you say so? Of course he realizes it. </seg>
<seg id="173"> She realizes that violent behavior is not permissible, but she has not disfigured anyone. </seg>
<seg id="174"> Unfortunately, the word is appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="175"> - My son did not disfigure your son. - On the contrary, he did! </seg>
<seg id="176"> - I'll go back to school and see you. - It is momentarily disfigured. </seg>
<seg id="177"> Your mouth will come back soon. </seg>
<seg id="178"> For teeth we will pay the best dentist. </seg>
<seg id="179"> There is insurance. </seg>
<seg id="180"> We just want to make peace and that there is not much more. </seg>
<seg id="181"> - Then we set a meeting. - SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="182"> - With us present? </seg>
<seg id="183"> - They do not need protectors. If they will shake it from men. - Stop it. </seg>
<seg id="184"> Perhaps it is true, maybe we should not be there. I think it's better. </seg>
<seg id="185"> The question is not whether or not to be there ... but if they want to talk and clarify. </seg>
<seg id="186"> - Ethan, sÃƒÂ¬. - And Zachary? </seg>
<seg id="187"> - There will be no choice. But he must leave him. </seg>
<seg id="188"> He acted as a thug, do not expect us to start thinking. </seg>
<seg id="189"> If Zachary sees Ethan in a punitive context, because he's forced ... I do not see how the result can be positive. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Our son is a crazy person ... she is deluded if she hopes to apologize spontaneously. </seg>
<seg id="191"> Sorry, I have to go back to the office ... but you, Nancy, stay here, so make a decision, so much I would not be useful. </seg>
<seg id="192"> Women think that the man, his father, is needed, as if he were to serve something. </seg>
<seg id="193"> Sorry, but I have to go too. </seg>
<seg id="194"> My husband has never been a pope he liked to push the stroller. </seg>
<seg id="195"> Too bad, they grow so fast! You liked being with the kids. </seg>
<seg id="196"> - He loved to push the stroller. - Sure. </seg>
<seg id="197"> So what do we do? </seg>
<seg id="198"> - Can you go to us at 19:30 with Ethan? </seg>
<seg id="199"> - Well, if you want my opinion ... - Yeah, please. </seg>
<seg id="200"> It's Zachary who should come here. </seg>
<seg id="201"> The victim should not get uncomfortable. </seg>
<seg id="202"> At 19:30 I can not be there. Who needs you? You're not useful. </seg>
<seg id="203"> - I think it's important that there is also the father. - But not tonight. </seg>
<seg id="204"> - Do you feel me now? </seg>
<seg id="205"> The annual report does not mention it, but the risk is not ascertained. There is no evidence. Make me call back from him. </seg>
<seg id="206"> - Tomorrow? - Tomorrow I'm in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="207"> Do you have customers in Washington? - The Pentagon. </seg>
<seg id="208"> The important thing is for the kids to meet. </seg>
<seg id="209"> I'll be here with Zachary at 7:30 pm. Let the kids clarify. </seg>
<seg id="210"> What's that? I do not feel convinced. </seg>
<seg id="211"> If Zachary does not come here already accountable ... they will look cagnesco! </seg>
<seg id="212"> - Already accountable? But what do you talk about? - Zachary is not crazy. - It's not a crazy person! - Lo Ã¨. </seg>
<seg id="213"> - Do not be crazy. Why do you say so? </seg>
<seg id="214"> - It's crazy. - How do you explain his gesture? - Do not talk about it. </seg>
<seg id="215"> - But it should. - She says a little bit of "should." </seg>
<seg id="216"> "He should come, he should talk, he should apologize ..." </seg>
<seg id="217"> He will be more competent than us. </seg>
<seg id="218"> We will try to improve, but she is indulgent. </seg>
<seg id="219"> Hey! Come on! But what happens now? </seg>
<seg id="220"> - That was not the purpose. - I'm telling him about Zachary. </seg>
<seg id="221"> - I understood it, thank you! - Alan! </seg>
<seg id="222"> - You want another cafe? A good coffee. -CaffÃƒÂ¨ ... </seg>
<seg id="223"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="224"> - A cafe, okay. -Tranquilla, Pen, I think about it. </seg>
<seg id="225"> - I see you're interested in art. - SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="226"> - Bacon. - SÃƒÂ¬, Bacon. </seg>
<seg id="227"> - "CrudeltÃ ° e splendore"! - "Chaos and Balance". </seg>
<seg id="228"> -Zachary is interested in art? - Not what it should. And her children? </seg>
<seg id="229"> - Let's fill the inevitable school gaps. </seg>
<seg id="230"> - We bring them to concerts and exhibitions. </seg>
<seg id="231"> - We believe that culture is a powerful force for peace. </seg>
<seg id="232"> - Right. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Is it a cake or a tart, if it's stuffed? It's important... </seg>
<seg id="234"> I thought, "Can the pizza be called 'tart'?" </seg>
<seg id="235"> This is a pie, the tart has the base of pastafrolla. </seg>
<seg id="236"> - She's a cook overwhelmed. - I like cooking. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Or you do it for passion or not ... </seg>
<seg id="238"> .. and I say it is tart if it has the pastafrolla base. </seg>
<seg id="239"> - Do you have other children? </seg>
<seg id="240"> - I have a son from a previous marriage. </seg>
<seg id="241"> I was wondering, although I know it's not important, ... </seg>
<seg id="242"> ... you know what the reason is, because Ethan does not say anything. </seg>
<seg id="243"> Ethan did not want to get Zachary into his gang. - Does Ethan have one? </seg>
<seg id="244"> - And he gave him the spy. - Did you know Ethan has a band? </seg>
<seg id="245"> - No, but I'm having fun! </seg>
<seg id="246"> - Why do you enjoy it? - I had one too, I was the boss. - Me too. </seg>
<seg id="247"> And who is the head of a band? </seg>
<seg id="248"> Have some little boy who admires you, ready to sacrifice for you ... </seg>
<seg id="249"> - Like in "Ivanhoe". - That's right! </seg>
<seg id="250"> - But who knows more "Ivanhoe" ?! - There are now models like Spiderman. </seg>
<seg id="251"> Then you know more of us ... </seg>
<seg id="252"> So Zachary has not been so silent. </seg>
<seg id="253"> Why did he give him a spy? </seg>
<seg id="254"> Let yourself be, it's a curiosity, this is not the point, we do not care. </seg>
<seg id="255"> - Better do not pinch </seg>
<seg id="256"> - It does not concern us. - Exactly. </seg>
<seg id="257"> What we are all about is this incident: violence concerns us. </seg>
<seg id="258"> When I was headed, I beat Jimmy Lich, barking ... ... and he was more than I was. </seg>
<seg id="259"> - What's this all about? - Nothing. </seg>
<seg id="260"> - They did not bother. </seg>
<seg id="261"> - Sure. It was just a reminder. - There is not much difference. </seg>
<seg id="262"> - Excuse me, but what is it? - There's a difference. </seg>
<seg id="263"> - And what is it? - I and Jimmy wanted to do it. </seg>
<seg id="264"> - Did it hurt you badly? - Just a little bit. </seg>
<seg id="265"> Just with Jimmy Lich. Are you sorry ... if I talk to Zachary? </seg>
<seg id="266"> - Of course not. - I would never do it without your permission. </seg>
<seg id="267"> - Talk to him, okay for us. - With best wishes... </seg>
<seg id="268"> Stop it, Alan. Why do you say so? </seg>
<seg id="269"> - Mrs. Longstreet ... - Penelope! No formalities. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Penelope ... she acts with the desire to educate ... </seg>
<seg id="271"> - If you prefer, I do not talk to him. - No, do whatever he wants. </seg>
<seg id="272"> It's weird that she feels so involved. </seg>
<seg id="273"> - Mrs. Longstreet ... - Penelope! </seg>
<seg id="274"> Penelope, I'm involved. My son hurt another kid. </seg>
<seg id="275"> - Intentionally. - These things irritate me ... Intentionally, yes. </seg>
<seg id="276"> - That makes a difference. - The difference between what and what? </seg>
<seg id="277"> Our son has beaten yours, so we're here. </seg>
<seg id="278"> - It's useless. - It's true, talking so is useless. </seg>
<seg id="279"> So what lesson do you want to teach me using the word "intentionally"? </seg>
<seg id="280"> So the conversation is ridiculous. </seg>
<seg id="281"> My husband is stressed out for work issues. </seg>
<seg id="282"> I'll be back tonight with Zachary and let everything get resolved. </seg>
<seg id="283"> - I'm not stressed. - Well, I do. </seg>
<seg id="284"> - There is no reason to be stressed. - Yes, instead. - SÃƒÂ¬? </seg>
<seg id="285"> Well, no comment. No comment! </seg>
<seg id="286"> No comment! </seg>
<seg id="287"> Thing?! To withdraw it is how to admit responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="288"> Retreating Antril would be like admitting responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="289"> In the Christmas recitation at school, what did Zachary do? </seg>
<seg id="290"> - The part of Ebenezer Scrooge. - Ebenezer Scrooge ... It's true! </seg>
<seg id="291"> - Michael, remember when he did Scrooge? -Sure. </seg>
<seg id="292"> - It was wonderful. - With that hat ... </seg>
<seg id="293"> We will deal with the patients after ... </seg>
<seg id="294"> We can not withdraw a medication because three guys can not walk straight! </seg>
<seg id="295"> For now, do nothing. </seg>
<seg id="296"> All right, I'll call you. </seg>
<seg id="297"> I'm panicked! Printing is with his breath on his neck. I want a statement that does not have to sound like a denial. Let's talk about it, let's attack them, like: ... .. "TW Pharma is the victim of a stock price manipulation ..." "... two weeks from the shareholders' meeting." And then, "Why does this story jump out of nowhere?" </seg>
<seg id="298"> Not a word on the question "health", only one question: ... .. "Who is behind this investigation?" </seg>
<seg id="299"> Good. </seg>
<seg id="300"> Nobody forced me to listen to my phone calls. </seg>
<seg id="301"> Nobody forced her to put them under my nose. </seg>
<seg id="302"> You're wrong, I'm forced to do it here and against my will. </seg>
<seg id="303"> GiÃƒÂ ... They sell their shit and then they wash their hands. </seg>
<seg id="304"> In the field of therapeutics, any progress involves benefits and risks. </seg>
<seg id="305"> I know, anyway ... you do an ambiguous job. </seg>
<seg id="306"> - What does it mean? - Michael, they are not our business. </seg>
<seg id="307"> - It's an ambiguous craft. - And what do you do? </seg>
<seg id="308"> - A normal craft. - And what is a normal craft? </seg>
<seg id="309"> - I sell pots and pans. - And door handles. </seg>
<seg id="310"> - And flushing devices and more. </seg>
<seg id="311"> - Dishwashing Devices: Interesting! </seg>
<seg id="312"> - Toilet flushes are interesting. - Why not? </seg>
<seg id="313"> Are there many different types? </seg>
<seg id="314"> - The basics are two: thrusters and manual ones. </seg>
<seg id="315"> - Of course ... - Depends on the pressure of the water. </seg>
<seg id="316"> - Clear! - That is, if the pipe is up or down. </seg>
<seg id="317"> If you want, I'll show you a warehouse worker who is an expert, but he's in Queens. </seg>
<seg id="318"> - He knows his job well. </seg>
<seg id="319"> - Do you think about punishing Zachary? </seg>
<seg id="320"> - I do not feel well. - What do you hear? </seg>
<seg id="321"> - You're pale. It is white as a sheet. </seg>
<seg id="322"> - I feel nauseous. - It takes Reglan. </seg>
<seg id="323"> - No, now go. - It's a Coca-Cola. </seg>
<seg id="324"> And hot. </seg>
<seg id="325"> - And hot. - Thank you. Is it safe? </seg>
<seg id="326"> - In small pits. - Coca-Cola was not in the fridge. </seg>
<seg id="327"> Call me right away. </seg>
<seg id="328"> - Does Coca-Cola work? Is not it more suitable for diarrhea? - Not only. Better? </seg>
<seg id="329"> I'd say so. Mrs. Longstreet ... </seg>
<seg id="330"> If we decided to scold our son ... we would like to do it in our own way, in the most appropriate way for us. </seg>
<seg id="331"> - We would miss it! - As? </seg>
<seg id="332"> - They are free to do as they believe. </seg>
<seg id="333"> - I do not agree. - On what?! </seg>
<seg id="334"> - I'm not free. In what sense, please? Keep on ... Sorry. SÃƒÂ¬? Perfect. </seg>
<seg id="335"> Yeah, but do not forget that there are no tests and secrecy. </seg>
<seg id="336"> Do not bullshit. </seg>
<seg id="337"> If we're wrong, Walter will end up with his ass on the floor and we'll be with him. </seg>
<seg id="338"> All right with this phone, Alan! You're here with us, cow cow! </seg>
<seg id="339"> Call me and read it. </seg>
<seg id="340"> Are you crazy? You started shouting like a hen. Dennis heard. </seg>
<seg id="341"> Good! I'm tired of that shit shit. Always, day and night! </seg>
<seg id="342"> You should thank me. I've made an effort to come here. </seg>
<seg id="343"> - Really? - I'm about to vomit. - I do not believe it. </seg>
<seg id="344"> - But sÃƒÂ¬. - Do you want to go to the bathroom? </seg>
<seg id="345"> - No one obliges you to stay. Exactly: It is not obligatory! </seg>
<seg id="346"> - It turns everything. - Look at a fixed point ... </seg>
<seg id="347"> - You see a part of the "L" line. - Go away! Leave me alone! </seg>
<seg id="348"> - Should not you go to the bathroom? - Go to the bathroom, if you have to vomit. </seg>
<seg id="349"> - From the Reglan. - Will it be sweet? </seg>
<seg id="350"> - No, I did yesterday. - Do not touch me! </seg>
<seg id="351"> - Calm down. - Do not take it for nothing. </seg>
<seg id="352"> For my husband, it is up to me to take care of home, school and garden! - It's not so. </seg>
<seg id="353"> - That's right, and I understand why it's so boring and deadly! </seg>
<seg id="354"> If it is dead, why do children do it? </seg>
<seg id="355"> Perhaps Zachary perceives your disinterest. </seg>
<seg id="356"> - But what disinterestedness ?! - She just said that. </seg>
<seg id="357"> Get a bucket! </seg>
<seg id="358"> Stupid bitch! </seg>
<seg id="359"> - You had to go to the bathroom, "Doodle" ... - She made her with her. </seg>
<seg id="360"> - Thing? - It was not my cake. </seg>
<seg id="361"> - Of course not, it's a nervous fact. </seg>
<seg id="362"> - If you like, I'll show you the bathroom. </seg>
<seg id="363"> Oh ... My Kokoschka! </seg>
<seg id="364"> - From the Reglan! - Now he can not keep anything inside. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Where's the bath? </seg>
<seg id="366"> I'll take you. </seg>
<seg id="367"> It's just nerves. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="369"> We can not dominate something that dominates us. </seg>
<seg id="370"> I always clench my neck. </seg>
<seg id="371"> Here it is. How do you do with the Kokoschka? Clean it, maybe with lioform. </seg>
<seg id="372"> The problem is to dry it. - Clean it with water and spray the colony. </seg>
<seg id="373"> - Colony ?! - There is my Kouros, which I never use. Pages will burst. </seg>
<seg id="374"> We dry them, then we crush them with books ... ... or we squeeze them out, as they do with the dollars. </seg>
<seg id="375"> -Oh God. - I'll get it another. </seg>
<seg id="376"> - It's unobtainable for years. </seg>
<seg id="377"> - I'm very sorry. - I'll save him. Let me do it. </seg>
<seg id="378"> It is the reprint of a catalog of an exhibition in London in London. </seg>
<seg id="379"> Get the phon and the colony, it's in the bathroom. </seg>
<seg id="380"> - Her husband is in the bathroom. - But it's not the crap! </seg>
<seg id="381"> I took it off almost everything, there was only a bit left over Dolgani. </seg>
<seg id="382"> Excuse me? </seg>
<seg id="383"> - Do you feel better? -SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="384"> - Where do I spray it? - Where's the phon? </seg>
<seg id="385"> - She's drying her pants. </seg>
<seg id="386"> - So let's wait for Kouros to come to an end. - Okay. </seg>
<seg id="387"> - Can I go to the bathroom too? - Yeah, of course ... of course. </seg>
<seg id="388"> I do not know what to say. </seg>
<seg id="389"> You have to excuse me. </seg>
<seg id="390"> - When you finished wearing the phon, please. - I'm mortified. </seg>
<seg id="391"> God! </seg>
<seg id="392"> Unbelievable! What balls! Unbelievable ... </seg>
<seg id="393"> - That cake was bad. - You're ingested like a pig. </seg>
<seg id="394"> You know my days, I have to send something to some point. </seg>
<seg id="395"> Oh shit! Oddio ... A real nightmare! </seg>
<seg id="396"> - That must be careful, it has exceeded the limit. - She's awful. </seg>
<seg id="397"> - Less! - It's so false. </seg>
<seg id="398"> - He'll give me a lot of annoyance. - They're unbearable. </seg>
<seg id="399"> Why are you always on their side? Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="400"> I'm not on their side! </seg>
<seg id="401"> But what the hell do we do here? </seg>
<seg id="402"> - Is that a joke ?! - Why are you always discussing with her? </seg>
<seg id="403"> We'd be gone if I did not get it all over. </seg>
<seg id="404"> Should I make the "sheep" like her husband? </seg>
<seg id="405"> - You say it was that cake? - It's safe. </seg>
<seg id="406"> A bit of hot Coca-Cola and ... "bang"! </seg>
<seg id="407"> What sucks ... </seg>
<seg id="408"> - Temporeggi, try to be conciliatory. - It's not true. </seg>
<seg id="409"> Yeah, well, you said you were a cape ... and they can do what they want with their son, even if it's a danger. </seg>
<seg id="410"> When a kid is a public danger, it's all about everyone. </seg>
<seg id="411"> It's incredible! That vomited on all my books! </seg>
<seg id="412"> Usually, if one feels he is vomiting, he runs into the bathroom! </seg>
<seg id="413"> Oh ... the Fujita! It's a disgusting thing. </seg>
<seg id="414"> I was about to break through the flush story. </seg>
<seg id="415"> - You were magnificent. - I defended myself well, did not I? </seg>
<seg id="416"> - Magnificent! - "In Queens" ... A genius shot. </seg>
<seg id="417"> - What a shit shit! - What's her name? - "Doodle". - Yeah, it's true! "Doodle" ... - "Doodle"! - Yeah, I call it "Doodle." </seg>
<seg id="418"> Excuse me ... We did not want to offend, really. </seg>
<seg id="419"> It is that the names that couples do give us always laugh. </seg>
<seg id="420"> We, Michael, call us a lot worse, right? </seg>
<seg id="421"> - Here's the phon. - Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="422"> - We call it "Darjeeling". - SÃƒÂ¬. - Like the tÃƒÂ¨. </seg>
<seg id="423"> Yeah ... That's a lot more ridiculous, I think. </seg>
<seg id="424"> - How's your wife? Do you feel better? - Yeah, better. </seg>
<seg id="425"> - I ... I reacted badly and I'm ashamed. - Give me. </seg>
<seg id="426"> I do not know why I did so long for the catalog. </seg>
<seg id="427"> It is that one attaches to these objects without knowing why. </seg>
<seg id="428"> - Pull the cover well. - And you keep the sheet well. - SÃƒÂ¬. - It's good, there are some creases. - The corners are still wet. - Now I fix them. - So you get rid of it. - He's right. - Okay. - It's dry. Just. -Ok. Put the colony on them, I finish this. </seg>
<seg id="429"> - "Doodle" where does it come from? - Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="430"> From "Yankee Doodle" or from cheese? </seg>
<seg id="431"> From a Bulli and Pupe song that makes "Doodle-loodle-loodle" ... </seg>
<seg id="432"> Yeah, I know her! </seg>
<seg id="433"> SÃ ... Ours comes from honeymoon in India. </seg>
<seg id="434"> They called us "Darjeeling" instead of "darling". What stupid thing! </seg>
<seg id="435"> - I'm going to see how it is. -So, go to her, "Darjeeling." - SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="436"> Oh, Nancy, here it is. I began to worry. Do you feel better? </seg>
<seg id="437"> - Yeah, better, I guess. - If you're not sure, stay away from the table. </seg>
<seg id="438"> I put the towel in the tub, I did not know where to put it. </seg>
<seg id="439"> Perfect. </seg>
<seg id="440"> - You've got it! I'm so sorry. - It's all right. </seg>
<seg id="441"> I'm sorry if I did not care about her, I was only taken by the Kokoschka. </seg>
<seg id="442"> - Do not worry. - I ... I was wrong. Please! </seg>
<seg id="443"> First, in the bathroom ... I was thinking ... </seg>
<seg id="444"> SÃƒÂ¬? </seg>
<seg id="445"> Maybe we did not consider one ... </seg>
<seg id="446"> - Well, well ... - What? What's that? </seg>
<seg id="447"> Well ... Apostrophing with insults is a kind of aggression. </seg>
<seg id="448"> - Sure. - It depends! - Of course ... it depends. </seg>
<seg id="449"> Zachary has never been violent, must have had his reasons. </seg>
<seg id="450"> How to be called "spy". Excuse me ... </seg>
<seg id="451"> SÃƒÂ¬, Walter? </seg>
<seg id="452"> There must not be a patient among the present. </seg>
<seg id="453"> Deny, deny! If necessary, we cause the "Journal" cause. </seg>
<seg id="454"> I send you the draft press release by e-mail. I must leave. </seg>
<seg id="455"> If anyone tells me the spy, I react. </seg>
<seg id="456"> Unless it's true. - Thing? </seg>
<seg id="457"> - That's it. </seg>
<seg id="458"> - Do you think my son is a spy? - But no, I was joking! </seg>
<seg id="459"> - Anyway, it's yours too. - How would that be? </seg>
<seg id="460"> - He said it was Zachary. - We forced him. </seg>
<seg id="461"> - We are not on the right track. - Anyway, he did the spy. </seg>
<seg id="462"> - Nancy? - Thing?! Do you think my son ... is it a spy? </seg>
<seg id="463"> - I do not believe anything. - Then do not say anything, do not insinuate. </seg>
<seg id="464"> There is no need to become nervous. </seg>
<seg id="465"> Me and Michael are striving to be impartial and conciliatory. </seg>
<seg id="466"> - Not so much impartial. - Really? </seg>
<seg id="467"> - Apparently impartial. - "Doodle," I have to go. </seg>
<seg id="468"> - And then go away, coward. </seg>
<seg id="469"> - I'm risking losing the most important customer I have. </seg>
<seg id="470"> So this endless shit ... </seg>
<seg id="471"> - My son has lost two incisors! - There's news coming. </seg>
<seg id="472"> - One, irrevocably. - They'll put others, better! </seg>
<seg id="473"> They did not break the timpani. </seg>
<seg id="474"> The error is not the source of the problem. </seg>
<seg id="475"> An 11-year-old boy beat another with a stick! </seg>
<seg id="476"> - Armed with a stick. - We took it off. </seg>
<seg id="477"> - Because we've asked you. We did not oppose it. </seg>
<seg id="478"> It is a term that indicates a clear premeditation and excludes the mistake ... </seg>
<seg id="479"> .. and the infancy of childhood. </seg>
<seg id="480"> - I can not tolerate this tone. - Between us there has never been feeling. </seg>
<seg id="481"> Mr. Cowan ... it's incredibly frustrating ... ..have heard of a mistake already admitted. </seg>
<seg id="482"> The term "armed" was unsuitable and was taken away! Well, in a lazy way, it was soaring. </seg>
<seg id="483"> Zachary reacted to an insult: if they attack me, I'm defending myself ... ... especially if I'm alone against an entire band! </seg>
<seg id="484"> - Since he has been vomited, he is tricked. - Does he realize his vulgarity? </seg>
<seg id="485"> We are all right people, I do not know why we've lost the brackets. </seg>
<seg id="486"> - It's useless. - Michael, just do it! </seg>
<seg id="487"> If we are apparently impartial, it is worth noting that it is not at all. </seg>
<seg id="488"> No, I do not like the china on which the two bastards brought us. </seg>
<seg id="489"> - Let's see Pen not see her like you. - Penelope! - Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="490"> So, Ethan is a sting ?! This is really scandalous. </seg>
<seg id="491"> - Now, I just have to go really. - Yeah, I too. </seg>
<seg id="492"> Go! I surrender. </seg>
<seg id="493"> Ready? </seg>
<seg id="494"> Hello Mom. No, there are friends, but tell me. </seg>
<seg id="495"> Yeah, do whatever the doctor tells you. </seg>
<seg id="496"> SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="497"> The "thing"? </seg>
<seg id="498"> Antril ?! You ... are you taking Antril? A second, mom! </seg>
<seg id="499"> That shit is called Antril? </seg>
<seg id="500"> My mother also takes it. Like thousands of other people. </seg>
<seg id="501"> Mom, you have to stop taking it now. </seg>
<seg id="502"> You now ... you have to do as I say, then I'll explain. </seg>
<seg id="503"> Mom, you have to tell the doctor I told you not to take it. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Good. </seg>
<seg id="505"> Why are you red? Who sees you? </seg>
<seg id="506"> Mom, it's ridiculous! Mum mum! </seg>
<seg id="507"> Mom ... There are people here. </seg>
<seg id="508"> Ok. I love you. Hello. </seg>
<seg id="509"> The crutches are red ... ... so that they do not get hit by trucks in the event of night walks. </seg>
<seg id="510"> They give you Antril for pressure. </seg>
<seg id="511"> If you have no side effects, I quote as a witness. </seg>
<seg id="512"> - Did not I have a scarf? - His indifference is annoying. </seg>
<seg id="513"> If my mother had any symptoms, I would promote a class action. </seg>
<seg id="514"> - There will still be one. - I hope. </seg>
<seg id="515"> It's stupid to be honest, you weaken, you lower your guard. </seg>
<seg id="516"> Come on, Nancy. We have heard enough of sermons for today. </seg>
<seg id="517"> Go, but I want to tell you something: ... ... that I know you, I'm not surprised that ... </seg>
<seg id="518"> What's your name? I'm not surprised that Zacary has behavioral problems. </seg>
<seg id="519"> - When you killed that little hamster ... - Killed ?! </seg>
<seg id="520"> Did I kill the hamster? </seg>
<seg id="521"> Yeah, try to make us feel guilty, do the morality paladins, ... ..when she, on the other hand, is a murderer! </seg>
<seg id="522"> - I did not kill the hamster. - Worse! He abandoned him trembling fear in a hostile environment. - It will be eaten by a dog or a rat! </seg>
<seg id="523"> -This is true. -Thing? - It's horrible what's going to happen to him. I thought he would be happy to go back to the sewers. - No, no! - He abandoned him out! </seg>
<seg id="524"> I can not touch anybody in that family. Pen, you know that! - She's afraid of rodents. - Yeah, I'm afraid of rodents. </seg>
<seg id="525"> And also of snakes and everything that sticks to the ground. - And why did not she go down looking for her? - Because I did not know. </seg>
<seg id="526"> She said this morning, so I went down, I went to the palace ... ... they went to the cellar too! </seg>
<seg id="527"> I find it intolerable to be put on the bench of the defendants ... ... for the history of the hamster involved in the family. </seg>
<seg id="528"> It's just us, it does not have to do with this situation ... ... and I do not admit that I get the assassin in my house. </seg>
<seg id="529"> - What's wrong with your house? - It's my home! I open the door! In fact, the sanctuary to accommodate ... ... as people who should be grateful. </seg>
<seg id="530"> Continue to "caress" the ego ... </seg>
<seg id="531"> - So do not worry! - No! I was disgusted, I'm so glad! </seg>
<seg id="532"> - Michael, it's ridiculous. - Thing? Are you gone mad too? </seg>
<seg id="533"> Does their son stick Ethan and you break the hooks for a hamster? </seg>
<seg id="534"> - What you did to the hamster is wrong. - I do not care a fuck! </seg>
<seg id="535"> You will not regret when your daughter comes back. </seg>
<seg id="536"> I do not get it under a nine-year-old fucker! </seg>
<seg id="537"> Here I agree with him 100%. </seg>
<seg id="538"> - You see it? It's pathetic. - Careful, Penelope ... Careful! </seg>
<seg id="539"> I've been quiet so far, but do not let me cross the limit. </seg>
<seg id="540"> - And Ethan? - What does that have to do with anything? - Is he even here? </seg>
<seg id="541"> - He has more to think about. - He was not fond of Culetto. </seg>
<seg id="542"> "Culetto"! How are you going to give a name like this ?! </seg>
<seg id="543"> Why do not you remarry, do you have to have our son? </seg>
<seg id="544"> All this dialogue and justification of the fuck really stiffened me. </seg>
<seg id="545"> We have been kind, we bought tulips, ... I am dressed as a progressist, ... ... the truth is that I can not afford more than these bullshit goodies. - I'm a fucking son of a bitch! - We're all here. </seg>
<seg id="546"> - No, not all are hysterical bitches. - Not her, it's obvious. </seg>
<seg id="547"> - No, no, thanks to God! - No ... "Darjeeling", not you! </seg>
<seg id="548"> You never lose control! </seg>
<seg id="549"> - Why are you so aggressive with me? - I'm sincere! </seg>
<seg id="550"> - You're aggressive. - You trapped me in this "carnival"! </seg>
<seg id="551"> - Should I trap you? - SÃƒÂ¬! - What a disgusting thing! </seg>
<seg id="552"> You are to preach that you have to be civil, and for me it's okay. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Of course, I'm going to preach it. Someone has to do it! </seg>
<seg id="554"> Do you think it would be better to be a hysterical son of a bitch? </seg>
<seg id="555"> - No one has said it, no one has criticized it. - Oh yeah! </seg>
<seg id="556"> - Do not say so. - Should I cause you cause? </seg>
<seg id="557"> Was it better to destroy you from the insurance company? </seg>
<seg id="558"> - Stop it, Pen. - Thing? - You lost the sense of measure! I do not care! </seg>
<seg id="559"> One does everything to escape the mediocrity ... and instead he ends up humiliated and completely alone. </seg>
<seg id="560"> SÃƒÂ¬, Walter? Get the evidence. They have to take the tests. </seg>
<seg id="561"> In my opinion, given the situation, it is better not to do anything. One is born alone and dies only. Stop! Who wants scotch? </seg>
<seg id="562"> Walter, I'm in the meeting. I'll call you from the office. I live with a totally negative person. </seg>
<seg id="563"> - Who is negative? - I. </seg>
<seg id="564"> - It was stupid to organize this meeting. </seg>
<seg id="565"> - I told you so. - Really? - SÃƒÂ¬. - Did you tell me not to organize it? </seg>
<seg id="566"> - It did not sound like a good idea. - It was, on the other hand. </seg>
<seg id="567"> - No. - Who wants it? - Did you tell me it was not a good idea? </seg>
<seg id="568"> - If I remember ... - "If I remember well"! - Just a little bit. </seg>
<seg id="569"> - You did not have to leave? "Since I'm here, so much to drink. </seg>
<seg id="570"> Michael, look at me and tell us we did not agree to the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="571"> Calm, Penelope, so we do not get to anything. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Who said, "Do not touch the cake, do we care for the Cowans?" </seg>
<seg id="573"> - It was very cute. - What does that have to do with anything? - How would that be? </seg>
<seg id="574"> - Guests are guests. - Tell the truth! It's a liar. </seg>
<seg id="575"> My wife, in fact, had to drag me to bring me here. </seg>
<seg id="576"> When one grows with John Wayne as a model, ... his instinct does not bring him to sort things out with words. </seg>
<seg id="577"> - I thought the model was Ivanhoe. - One is worth the other. - They are complementary. - "They are complementary" ... How much do you want to humble yourself yet? </seg>
<seg id="578"> Moving it here has not served anything. </seg>
<seg id="579"> What did you expect, "Doodle"? What a ridiculous name! </seg>
<seg id="580"> New revelations on maximum systems? This scotch is incredible. </seg>
<seg id="581"> True? 18 years of aging. It comes from a Scottish village where they still use only their barley. </seg>
<seg id="582"> Who took the tulips? </seg>
<seg id="583"> I just said, "Sorry, we did not pick the tulips this week." </seg>
<seg id="584"> I did not ask you to go to dawn till Henry Street! </seg>
<seg id="585"> Do not take it for these things, it's not worth it. </seg>
<seg id="586"> The tulips he wanted him, just him! </seg>
<seg id="587"> And do not we drink anything? Eh? </seg>
<seg id="588"> Penelope and I would like a drink. </seg>
<seg id="589"> It's ... pretty funny, you know? </seg>
<seg id="590"> A fan of John Wayne and lvanhoe who is afraid of a mole! </seg>
<seg id="591"> Enough with this hamster. Stop it. </seg>
<seg id="592"> - He's right, you're funny. - And for her? - I think it's better than no. </seg>
<seg id="593"> - Give me a drink, Michael. - No. - Michael! - No! </seg>
<seg id="594"> What's up, Michael? All right! Drink! So much for me? </seg>
<seg id="595"> - Does alcohol hurt her, by accident? - No, it's the ideal for me! </seg>
<seg id="596"> I do not know... </seg>
<seg id="597"> - Mr. Cowan? - Alan. - Alan ... </seg>
<seg id="598"> You see ... between us two there is no feeling ... ... I live with one who has decided definitively ... ... that life is synonymous with mediocrity. </seg>
<seg id="599"> It is very hard to stay with one who lives enthralled behind this idea ... ... that he does not want to change anything and that he does not get excited at all! </seg>
<seg id="600"> Why do you say to him these things? You know how much he cares! </seg>
<seg id="601"> Everybody needs to believe in a possible ... evolution! </seg>
<seg id="602"> He is the last person to make these speeches. </seg>
<seg id="603"> I say what I want to whom I want. </seg>
<seg id="604"> Who the fuck is right now? </seg>
<seg id="605"> Hello Mom. </seg>
<seg id="606"> Is fine. They broke two teeth, but he's fine. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Yeah, they hurt him, but they'll pass. </seg>
<seg id="608"> I told you there are some people. I'll call you later. Hello. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Are they still hurt? - No. </seg>
<seg id="610"> - So why is it worrying about her mother? - She wants to put anxiety on her. </seg>
<seg id="611"> Penelope, enough! Why do you always do a tragedy for shit? </seg>
<seg id="612"> Penelope, we all care about ourselves. </seg>
<seg id="613"> We would like to believe in a possible evolution ... of which we, abandoned all forms of selfishness, ... may be the true artifacts. Like you, who writes a book on Darfur ... It's a very noble thing! </seg>
<seg id="614"> I understand that one says, "I take a massacre, the story is full, ..." "..and write a book to me". </seg>
<seg id="615"> - Everyone is saved as he can. - But I do not write this book to save me! </seg>
<seg id="616"> - He did not read it, he does not even know what this is all about! - It does not change. </seg>
<seg id="617"> My God ... The odor of Kouros will end up killing me. </seg>
<seg id="618"> - A fucking stench. - She took her hand. - Excuse me. - It's my fault, I splashed like a madman. But why ... can things not be simpler? </seg>
<seg id="619"> Why should it be all that stressful? </seg>
<seg id="620"> She thinks too much ... Women think too much. </seg>
<seg id="621"> - Original as a response. - What does it mean to "think too much"? </seg>
<seg id="622"> How can you continue to live without the slightest moral concept in the world? </seg>
<seg id="623"> - Look, I'm alive! - Michael, shut up! </seg>
<seg id="624"> With your painful complicity, you can get me disgusted. </seg>
<seg id="625"> - Where's your sense of humor? - I do not have it and I do not want it. </seg>
<seg id="626"> In my opinion, the couple is the worst torture God has ever inflicted on us. </seg>
<seg id="627"> - Oh, wonderful! - The couple and the family. </seg>
<seg id="628"> It is not obligatory to tell it to us and it is also uncomfortable! </seg>
<seg id="629"> - It's not a problem. - You agree with me, do you? </seg>
<seg id="630"> Just jump to pole! </seg>
<seg id="631"> - Alan, say something! - He has the right to have his ideas. </seg>
<seg id="632"> - But you do not have to boast it! - SÃƒÂ¬, maybe. </seg>
<seg id="633"> What do we care about their marriage? </seg>
<seg id="634"> We are here for the problem of children, not for their marriage. </seg>
<seg id="635"> - Yeah, huh ... - What? </seg>
<seg id="636"> - They're connected. - Of course they're connected. </seg>
<seg id="637"> - Are Ethan's teeth connected to our wedding? </seg>
<seg id="638"> - SÃƒÂ¬. - I do not follow you. </seg>
<seg id="639"> - Let's go back and look at our situation. </seg>
<seg id="640"> Your children suck your life and leave you old and off, ... ... it's a law of nature! Young men who marry have no idea what's waiting for them! Poor bastards! They are happy, before no one tells him anything. </seg>
<seg id="641"> A friend of my time is about to have a son. </seg>
<seg id="642"> I told him, "A son at our age? Are you a kid?" </seg>
<seg id="643"> "Maybe you'll still have 10 years before you get cancer or a heart attack ..." "and you want to have a son?" </seg>
<seg id="644"> - You do not really think so. - Yes, instead. - I think even worse. </seg>
<seg id="645"> So he's humiliating. </seg>
<seg id="646"> - He says? -That's a cry, Penelope! It only worsens things. </seg>
<seg id="647"> -SÃƒÂ¬. - Oh, but of course ... </seg>
<seg id="648"> - Exceptional, right? - Awesome. - Are you interested in a cigar? </seg>
<seg id="649"> - No cigars in this house! - What a pity. </seg>
<seg id="650"> Did you want to smoke a cigar? </seg>
<seg id="651"> I do what I want and if I get a cigar, I smoke it. </seg>
<seg id="652"> I do not mind not to be sorry for Penelope, which is already quite tense, ... ..wanna be good! </seg>
<seg id="653"> The stopping to whimper, Nancy is right. </seg>
<seg id="654"> See women crying sends men to the beast. </seg>
<seg id="655"> In addition, Michael's thinking, for me, is fully shared. </seg>
<seg id="656"> SÃƒÂ¬? Yes, of course, go. </seg>
<seg id="657"> - Type "New York" and specify the time and day. - Unbearable. </seg>
<seg id="658"> Specifies the time and day on which it is shipped. </seg>
<seg id="659"> Do not "examine", it's too sloppy, better "disapproves". </seg>
<seg id="660"> - It's always like this, day and night. - A second. </seg>
<seg id="661"> - Our life is marked by that cell phone. - It's important. </seg>
<seg id="662"> It's always so: what's happening elsewhere is always more important. </seg>
<seg id="663"> Not "strategy", "maneuver". A maneuver that emerges in two weeks from the shareholders' meeting ... By the way, at the table ... everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="664"> "An inquiry" in quotation marks. Put it in quotation marks. </seg>
<seg id="665"> I do not even protest anymore. Unconditional yield! </seg>
<seg id="666"> - Maybe I'm still vomiting. - Where's the bucket? - I do not know! </seg>
<seg id="667"> Then, quote my words. </seg>
<seg id="668"> - It's close to the bucket, please. - Pen! - What's up? I've set everything up, this time. </seg>
<seg id="669"> "Stabilize my client, as the lawyer of TW Pharma says." At Reuters, in newspapers, in specialized journals. Atutti. </seg>
<seg id="670"> - What do you have? - It's about to vomit. </seg>
<seg id="671"> - Your interest touches me. - I'm worried. </seg>
<seg id="672"> - I did not understand it ... </seg>
<seg id="673"> Come on, Nancy, please, we can not do that ... </seg>
<seg id="674"> Their marriage has now "gone", we do not compete. </seg>
<seg id="675"> Who gives you the right to say that our marriage is "gone"? </seg>
<seg id="676"> SÃƒÂ¬, Walter? Yeah, I've just read it. </seg>
<seg id="677"> You'll see that she's coming to you now. To manipulate the stock price. Look, Walter, I'll call you. - I did not tell him, Steve said. </seg>
<seg id="678"> -Michael! - Michael, excuse me. - I do not let her judge. </seg>
<seg id="679"> - Then you do not judge our son. He beat Ethan. </seg>
<seg id="680"> They're young! When they play, the kids have been kidding, ever since! - It's a rule of life. - It's not true. - Yes, instead. </seg>
<seg id="681"> It takes some maturity to replace the right to violence. </seg>
<seg id="682"> Originally the right, as you will know, was brute force! </seg>
<seg id="683"> - Speaking of prehistory, but not today. - What do we mean today? </seg>
<seg id="684"> She is heavy, like this whole conversation. </seg>
<seg id="685"> Penelope, my belief is the god of the massacre ... ... the god who rules indisputably from the night of the times. </seg>
<seg id="686"> She is interested in Africa, right? </seg>
<seg id="687"> - What happens? - Do not worry. </seg>
<seg id="688"> - Nancy? - I'm fine. - Okay ... </seg>
<seg id="689"> I have just returned from Congo. I've seen eight-year-old children trained to kill ... ... who also kill hundreds of people ... with the machetes, the miter, the kalash ... with the Thumper! </seg>
<seg id="690"> So if my son breaks a pair of teeth to a kid ... with a bamboo cane in public gardens, ... I can not get angry with her. </seg>
<seg id="691"> - You should! - Thumper! - That's what the gangsters call. </seg>
<seg id="692"> - They call it so. How are you? - Very well! </seg>
<seg id="693"> - What did she take? - It is, it's nothing. </seg>
<seg id="694"> You can not speak to Africa, I know the suffering of Africa! </seg>
<seg id="695"> - I do not doubt it. - I do not think of anything else for months. </seg>
<seg id="696"> Avoid touching this subject, please. </seg>
<seg id="697"> - It's getting me nice! - Shut up! </seg>
<seg id="698"> It fights for peace and to maintain the balance of the world. Close that fucking mouth! </seg>
<seg id="699"> - Do you still want to? - More than safe. It can not do me well. </seg>
<seg id="700"> This is New York City, we are not ... Kinshasa! </seg>
<seg id="701"> We live according to the laws of the western society ... ... so what happens at the Brooklyn Bridge Park ... ... it is the values ​​of the West ... ... which, by the way, I'm lucky and I'm proud to belong. </seg>
<seg id="702"> - Puppy your husband must be one of those values. </seg>
<seg id="703"> - Watch out! It's thrown on her like a murderous fury! </seg>
<seg id="704"> My heart would loose. </seg>
<seg id="705"> - He's fucking her! I can not believe it. - What does it matter to him? </seg>
<seg id="706"> No, really, morality forces you to dominate your own impulses, ... ..there are moments when we do not want to do it. </seg>
<seg id="707"> Why should not I say Ave Maria having sex? </seg>
<seg id="708"> - Is this scotch here? - No I do not think so. </seg>
<seg id="709"> "Thumper"! </seg>
<seg id="710"> - "Thumper", it's true! - SÃƒÂ¬. - It's called so. </seg>
<seg id="711"> Why do not you just say "launches"? </seg>
<seg id="712"> It is called so-called "kalash" and not "kalashnikov" or "AK-47". </seg>
<seg id="713"> -Who says that? - Now, Nancy. </seg>
<seg id="714"> It is clear that for a successful man like my husband, ... it is difficult to be concerned with the problems of the mortal ones. </seg>
<seg id="715"> - That's right! - I do not understand... </seg>
<seg id="716"> I do not understand why today, in the global age, ... ... you can not have a bit of sense of participation. </seg>
<seg id="717"> Oh, Penelope, save these boring mummies! </seg>
<seg id="718"> - Now I'm gonna kill him! - SÃƒÂ¬? </seg>
<seg id="719"> - He is right, after a while he can not stand. </seg>
<seg id="720"> "A veiled attempt to ...". Here, so! </seg>
<seg id="721"> Did he have any problems with the rest? Good. </seg>
<seg id="722"> What were we saying? Thumper ... </seg>
<seg id="723"> We were saying that, despite my husband's ideas ... ... things do not concern more than one single country ... ... but I'm concerned with the citizens of the world. "the citizens of the world" ... SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="724"> Nancy, it's absurd to drink in your conditions. </seg>
<seg id="725"> What conditions? I 'm very good. </seg>
<seg id="726"> It's an interesting idea ... Yeah? </seg>
<seg id="727"> No, no interviews before the announcement. </seg>
<seg id="728"> Mr. Cowan, could you end this dreary conversation? </seg>
<seg id="729"> Remember that the shareholders do not give a fuck. Shareholders ... </seg>
<seg id="730"> Nancy, what are you doing? Are you crazy? </seg>
<seg id="731"> Here! - Fuck! - OMG! - So do it! Ah-ha! Here it is. </seg>
<seg id="732"> - It takes the phon! - You're asylum, dear! </seg>
<seg id="733"> I got it all there, inside! It's all right there! I just bought it and I took hours to configure it. </seg>
<seg id="734"> I do not understand ... It was a gesture irresponsible. </seg>
<seg id="735"> All my life ... is there! </seg>
<seg id="736"> You have to remove the sim card and the battery. How do you do it? </seg>
<seg id="737"> - I just bought it ... I do not know! - Let me see. - It's locked. - Look at them as they laugh! Penelope, look at them ... Penelope, stop laughing! </seg>
<seg id="738"> My husband spent the afternoon drying anything. No, this ... - Leave it, it's gone. - You have to wait. - He has gone! </seg>
<seg id="739"> - Do you want to use the phone? - No. Well, I have to say ... </seg>
<seg id="740"> Thing? Thing? What do you have to say, Michael? </seg>
<seg id="741"> No, I have nothing to say. </seg>
<seg id="742"> I say it's a lot better as well. It's so much better, do not you think so? </seg>
<seg id="743"> Men affection to their play, ... ... even if it makes him lose credibility. I was with one ... ... when I saw it with a rectangular purse with the shoulder strap, ... ... a man's handbag but with the shoulder strap ... it's over! </seg>
<seg id="744"> The bag with the shoulder strap is terrible, ... ... having the phone in hand is still worse. </seg>
<seg id="745"> Men should have both hands free, they must have them free! </seg>
<seg id="746"> John Wayne is also my man's idea. </seg>
<seg id="747"> He wore a Colt 45 that made the vacuum around. </seg>
<seg id="748"> A man who does not emit vibrations from the gloomy ... ... it's as if it were devoid of consistency. </seg>
<seg id="749"> So ... Michael, we'll be happy now! </seg>
<seg id="750"> This goodwill, as she said, is going to whores, ... ... I have the feeling that it is almost enjoyable. </seg>
<seg id="751"> That's my opinion. My opinion is that unfortunately some people do not hold alcohol well. </seg>
<seg id="752"> - They're more than lucid. - Of course! </seg>
<seg id="753"> I begin to see things with a pleasant serenity. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Good this: "A pleasant serenity." </seg>
<seg id="755"> I do not understand why you're drunk in front of aliens, "Darjeeling." </seg>
<seg id="756"> - Shut up! - Alan, please, relax. </seg>
<seg id="757"> No cigars in the house! There's Hoyo de Monterrey, Partagas D number 4, ... and there's the Hoyo Coronation! </seg>
<seg id="758"> - Where did you find them? - Better not tell her. - Forward! Hispanic contacts: One of my suppliers is with a hostess ... ..that brings two boxes a week. </seg>
<seg id="759"> You can not smoke at the home of an asthmatic child. Why do you tell your facts? </seg>
<seg id="760"> - Who has asthma? - Our son. - But we had the hamster! </seg>
<seg id="761"> Yes, you should not keep animals when you have asthma. </seg>
<seg id="762"> - No, it's not advisable. - Even red fish are not advised. </seg>
<seg id="763"> I have to fuck all these bullshit! </seg>
<seg id="764"> Maybe I'm the only one to not see things "with a nice serenity"! </seg>
<seg id="765"> The truth is that this is the happiest day of my life. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Are you drunk unhappy! </seg>
<seg id="767"> Michael, every word that comes out of your mouth kills me. </seg>
<seg id="768"> I'm not drunk, I drank a couple of scum of that scotch wretched ... ..will pull you out like the eighth wonder of the world! </seg>
<seg id="769"> I'm not drunk, but believe me ... I'd drown every misery into a good spiral. </seg>
<seg id="770"> My husband is also unhappy. </seg>
<seg id="771"> He got tired of it as if he had been abandoned on the roadside. </seg>
<seg id="772"> (Nancy) I think that even for him is the most unhappy day of his life. </seg>
<seg id="773"> - Lo Ã¨. - I'm sorry, Doodle. </seg>
<seg id="774"> Ready? </seg>
<seg id="775"> Ah ... Ready? </seg>
<seg id="776"> Mom! I told you we have guests! Have you forgotten it? </seg>
<seg id="777"> Because it's a bad drug, it's a poison. </seg>
<seg id="778"> No, Mom, here is a person who can explain it to you. </seg>
<seg id="779"> - Tell her. - Thing? </seg>
<seg id="780"> The one who knows about that fucking poison. </seg>
<seg id="781"> What do you want her to say? He does not know anything! </seg>
<seg id="782"> Good morning how are you lady? </seg>
<seg id="783"> Oh ... Yeah, what symptoms do you have? </seg>
<seg id="784"> Yes, but the operation will solve everything. </seg>
<seg id="785"> Uh, the other leg, huh? </seg>
<seg id="786"> No, I'm not an orthopedist. Now he calls me "doctor"! </seg>
<seg id="787"> "Doctor" ... It's ridiculous! Come on, put it on. </seg>
<seg id="788"> Yeah ... you lose balance, mister? </seg>
<seg id="789"> SÃƒÂ¬ ... No! Of course not! Kill her ... Do not give gossip. </seg>
<seg id="790"> Anyway, it might be a good idea to hang it up for a while ... ... until it's completely cured. </seg>
<seg id="791"> - Yeah, I hear it. It seems to me in great shape. - Come on! Did you understand? Stop taking that medicine. </seg>
<seg id="792"> Do what I tell you. I got it? A kiss. </seg>
<seg id="793"> I can not stand it anymore. They're just breaks of balls. </seg>
<seg id="794"> So let's go back to our problem. </seg>
<seg id="795"> We should decide what to do with Zach tonight. </seg>
<seg id="796"> Or maybe, we think, "Who cares?" We came here for this, no? </seg>
<seg id="797"> Now I'm about to vomit. Where's the bucket? </seg>
<seg id="798"> Stop it now. I just said enough! </seg>
<seg id="799"> They both did wrong. SÃƒÂ¬! That's right, they both made a mistake. </seg>
<seg id="800"> - Are you serious? - How, please? </seg>
<seg id="801"> - Are you serious? - I say seriously, yes! </seg>
<seg id="802"> Ethan, to whom I gave two Codeine at three o'clock at night, was wrong ?! </seg>
<seg id="803"> It is not said that this is not the reality. </seg>
<seg id="804"> Get out of my house right away. Out of the whip! Outside, fuck! </seg>
<seg id="805"> My bag! My bag! Alan! But am I crazy? </seg>
<seg id="806"> - Alan, you have to intervene! - "Alan, you have to intervene"! </seg>
<seg id="807"> Close that mouthpiece! It broke the mirror and the perfume. </seg>
<seg id="808"> Alan, why do not you defend me? </seg>
<seg id="809"> - It's time to go. - In the end I'm not strangulating it! </seg>
<seg id="810"> But what did I do to them? </seg>
<seg id="811"> They did not do both wrong: victims and executioners are not the same! </seg>
<seg id="812"> - A "carnivore"? - Fuck, Penelope, just with these nasty fucks! </seg>
<seg id="813"> - But why do I claim it? - Yeah, you "claim"! </seg>
<seg id="814"> Your cook for those Sudanese Negroes now carry it on everything. </seg>
<seg id="815"> Astounding! What do you have? Why are you acting miserable? </seg>
<seg id="816"> Because I feel it. I want to be miserable! </seg>
<seg id="817"> When you realize that horrors are done in that part of the world, ... you will bitterly regret your obscene nihilism, miserable! </seg>
<seg id="818"> Yeah, "Darjeeling", you're the best in the world, ... ..you are the most beautiful, the best! Yeah, you got it! You understand! </seg>
<seg id="819"> I would say it's time to go. These two are monsters. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - Well, Nancy. - No. No! I want to keep drinking. I want to fall drunk drenched. </seg>
<seg id="821"> That bastard pulled my bag and nobody moved a finger ... </seg>
<seg id="822"> - I want to fall drunk. - That's enough. </seg>
<seg id="823"> And you let her even say our son is an executioner! </seg>
<seg id="824"> We come here to clarify things, instead they insult us, ... they abuse us, they teach us how to be citizens of the world! </seg>
<seg id="825"> I am proud to have a son who has beaten your son ... ... and I clean my ass with his human dick rights! </seg>
<seg id="826"> Wow! With two glasses, here it is ... His true nature comes out! </seg>
<seg id="827"> Where is that sweet and reserved woman finished? </seg>
<seg id="828"> - I told you! - What did he say to him? </seg>
<seg id="829"> That she was false! Only false! I'm sorry. </seg>
<seg id="830"> - And when did you tell him? - While she was drying in the bathroom. </seg>
<seg id="831"> She knew her for a few minutes and she knew she was false? </seg>
<seg id="832"> - It does not take long for me to understand it. - That's it. - I feel it in the skin. </seg>
<seg id="833"> - What do you mean by "false"? - Why do I have to listen to you, Alan? </seg>
<seg id="834"> Relax, Nancy. </seg>
<seg id="835"> It's a fake. It does not matter to you, as well as to her! </seg>
<seg id="836"> - True. - Yeah, it's true. - Well, he said it was true. </seg>
<seg id="837"> It does not matter a fuck. It was so obvious right away! </seg>
<seg id="838"> - And it's the same for her. - But do you care? </seg>
<seg id="839"> - What - Let's talk about it. Tell me what it really matters to him. Do you know that she is more credible when it behaves miserable? </seg>
<seg id="840"> In truth, we all shake it off, maybe Penelope, which, I recognize, is the only coherent one. </seg>
<seg id="841"> I do not want her to be recognized. I do not want it! </seg>
<seg id="842"> But I really want to, really ... </seg>
<seg id="843"> Yeah, "Doodle," we're interested in, but messy. We are not the champions of the civil rights movement. </seg>
<seg id="844"> I saw her friend Jane Fonda on TV the other day. </seg>
<seg id="845"> I almost did not post a Ku Klux Klan poster! </seg>
<seg id="846"> Is my friend Jane Fonda ?! But I care! What does it mean? </seg>
<seg id="847"> You are very similar, you are part of the same kind: ... ... committed to resolving everything. </seg>
<seg id="848"> Those women do not like, ... we prefer sensuality, madness, hormonal storms. </seg>
<seg id="849"> Those who want to show off their intuitive ability ... ... make us want to pass. </seg>
<seg id="850"> - Even to him, to his poor husband, he passes the urge. - Do not talk to me. </seg>
<seg id="851"> She does not care a fuck about what she likes women! </seg>
<seg id="852"> Why do you "vomit" opinions? </seg>
<seg id="853"> If there is one whose opinion does not matter a fuck, it's her! </seg>
<seg id="854"> How to fuck ... Like a negro on a slave ship. </seg>
<seg id="855"> Because, she has not just screamed ... ... that your stunts did well to beat ours? </seg>
<seg id="856"> Yeah, he did fine. Our son is not a small cacasotto. Yours is a fucking spy! </seg>
<seg id="857"> It's time to go, Alan. Why are we still in this house? </seg>
<seg id="858"> Here's what I think of your stupid tulips, your horrendous flowers! </seg>
<seg id="859"> Also for me is the happiest day of my life. </seg>

<seg id="2"> - Sit down. - Roberto? </seg>

<seg id="11"> What are you doing? </seg>
<seg id="12"> Well, relax, I'm a bit here. Maybe I smoke a cigarette </seg>
<seg id="13"> Coffee and cigarettes are good together. You think it's too much </seg>
<seg id="14"> I do not know, do you think she's drinking too much? </seg>
<seg id="15"> No. Coffee is good for health, do not you? </seg>
<seg id="16"> I enjoy drinking it before going to sleep. </seg>
<seg id="17"> I'll get a lot of it before. Accelerate your dreams. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Like in Indianopolis, with cameras on racing cars ... Everything runs fast, like dreams. </seg>
<seg id="19"> One dream after another, after another, after another. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The next day they ask me what I dreamed of. </seg>
<seg id="21"> I say, it would take so long. And I do not. </seg>
<seg id="22"> - Do you smoke? - Only when I drink ... coffee. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Do you know my mother? </seg>
<seg id="24"> - If I know your mother? - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="25"> I do not know, but I do not think so. </seg>
<seg id="26"> - The coffee. They should freeze it, do not you find it? - Yup! </seg>
<seg id="27"> Put it in the ice tray and put in sticks for children. </seg>
<seg id="28"> So you get used to small ones .. Type icicle caffeine. </seg>

<seg id="41"> From here, oh ... I have to go away shortly. I have appointment from the dentist. </seg>
<seg id="42"> But I do not want to go. I do not like dentists. </seg>
<seg id="43"> - But I have to go, unfortunately. </seg>
<seg id="44"> - Yeah. - It's a piece that I'm not leaving. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Bravo, do not you go? </seg>

<seg id="55"> - Steven, thank you very much. - No problem. </seg>
<seg id="56"> - Do not you dry it? - No </seg>
<seg id="57"> An appointment from the dentist, what a beauty. </seg>
<seg id="58"> I have to go. Excuse me, Steve. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Steve, yes, I have to go to the dentist. - I'm late. </seg>
<seg id="60"> - Thanks, and sorry, I'm sorry. - But figured, do not be late. </seg>
<seg id="61"> - It was a pleasure. - For me, in a way. </seg>
<seg id="62"> What do we do in Memphis? </seg>
<seg id="63"> - It was your idea to come. - No, yours. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Is my idea? It was yours. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Very funny. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Do not smoke those cigarette cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="67"> I hate you. </seg>
<seg id="68"> - So what? - What are you, a cawboy? </seg>
<seg id="69"> - I'm fine. Pure Tobacco. - No, this is pure stuff. </seg>
<seg id="70"> - This is the stupid pleasure of the cigarette. - It's overworked, are you crazy? </seg>
<seg id="71"> - I am not. - But shut up. </seg>
<seg id="72"> What do we do here? Full? </seg>
<seg id="73"> - Even. </seg>
<seg id="74"> - You are welcome? - Oh yes. </seg>
<seg id="75"> - Hey! - Shit! Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="76"> - Are you stupid, what are you doing? - Fuck, I'm sorry. </seg>
<seg id="77"> I would not even pay the bill. This place is terrible. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Do not you take anything else? Only... </seg>
<seg id="79"> - Let me sign in. - Only coffee and cigarettes? </seg>
<seg id="80"> It's not very healthy, you know? </seg>
<seg id="81"> - Do you bring some sandwich, something? - No. </seg>
<seg id="82"> Are you part of these? - No. </seg>
<seg id="83"> Are you brother and sister? </seg>
<seg id="84"> - Even. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Are twins? </seg>
<seg id="86"> - Even. </seg>
<seg id="87"> We are. </seg>
<seg id="88"> I imagined. Do you know who you remember? </seg>
<seg id="89"> - Who? - Heckel and Jeckel. </seg>
<seg id="90"> And what a fuck. </seg>
<seg id="91"> Do you know ... the talking girls? </seg>
<seg id="92"> However, who is the bad twin? It works like this, right? </seg>
<seg id="93"> - This cafe knows mushrooms. - It's true. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Which of the two has the bad air, according to you? </seg>
<seg id="95"> I think so, what do you say? He has bad eyes. </seg>
<seg id="96"> - I'm kidding. - It will be better for you. </seg>
<seg id="97"> You know, I thought of something, since you're twins. </seg>
<seg id="98"> - Have you been to Graceland? - No. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Oh, you should. Is strong. </seg>
<seg id="100"> - Is it a problem if I sit down? - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="101"> All right, sit down. Are you paused? </seg>
<seg id="102"> Not really, but the bar is empty. Do me a favor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> Do not move, cover it so your boss does not see me. </seg>
<seg id="104"> Is it bad or not? </seg>
<seg id="105"> I was thinking of one thing. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Did you know that Elvis Presley had a twin? </seg>
<seg id="107"> Yes, it's called Jesse Garon. Elvis's second name was Aron. </seg>
<seg id="108"> Aron, Garon. Anyway, did not everyone think he was dead? </seg>
<seg id="109"> For me... </seg>
<seg id="110"> the mother, expecting a son only, did not want to pull it on two. </seg>
<seg id="111"> He could not afford it, </seg>
<seg id="112"> So one gave it away. </seg>
<seg id="113"> So this Jesse grew up in Arkansas or Mississippi. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Without knowing having a brother. Until one day, in '68 or '69 ... </seg>
<seg id="115"> ... while looking into the mirror, he said, "Caspita, I'm identical to Elvis." </seg>
<seg id="116"> He went to Memphis. </seg>
<seg id="117"> Elvis sees it and says, "You are my brother, I can not believe it!" </seg>
<seg id="118"> "What can I do for you?" </seg>
<seg id="119"> And his brother replied, "I do not know." </seg>
<seg id="120"> "It would be great to be you for a night." </seg>
<seg id="121"> Elvis had a concert, but singing sends us his brother. </seg>
<seg id="122"> He wanted to see if people dropped us. And for misery, even hearing them was the same. </seg>
<seg id="123"> Then Elvis came up with an idea. </seg>
<seg id="124"> "I'm tired of being on tour, I'm sending him." </seg>
<seg id="125"> Big mistake! His brother started to go to Las Vegas ... </seg>
<seg id="126"> ... to wear collars, white suits and cloaks, you know? </seg>
<seg id="127"> Elvis would never do it. And it was his brother what grew fat. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Filling up with fried and fried breads. </seg>
<seg id="129"> And the Colonel said, "Take it off her feet, she can not do Elvis anymore" </seg>
<seg id="130"> And they began to blush it with pills. They say they made it out. </seg>
<seg id="131"> Then? Conclusion? How does history end? </seg>
<seg id="132"> - Are you fan of Elvis? - No. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Want to hear something about Elvis? I'll tell you, okay? </seg>
<seg id="134"> Have you ever heard of Otis Blackwell? - No </seg>
<seg id="135"> - Of Junior Parker? - No </seg>
<seg id="136"> I was sure. Elvis stole their music. </seg>
<seg id="137"> He gave them $ 10 each, to them and to all the other black musicians. </seg>
<seg id="138"> - Here's what I think of Elvis. - And it all marries my theory. </seg>
<seg id="139"> For me it was not Elvis, he was his brother. </seg>
<seg id="140"> If so, we're in place, right? </seg>
<seg id="141"> His phrase I prefer is, "The only thing a nigger can do is to lick my shoes." </seg>
<seg id="142"> The King can not have said it. I think he was his bad twin. </seg>
<seg id="143"> Danny, what are you doing down there? You have to serve the tables, walk. </seg>
<seg id="144"> - I'll be right back. - Do not throw yourself out, buddy. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Danny! Poof buzzurro. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Cin Cin, health. </seg>
<seg id="147"> I feel a strange odor. </seg>
<seg id="148"> Hey! Did you put my shirt on? </seg>
<seg id="149"> No I do not think so. </seg>
<seg id="150"> I think so, instead. It smells like me. </seg>
<seg id="151"> You know what you know? </seg>
<seg id="152"> I know about myself, and this one knows about you. </seg>
<seg id="153"> - I also know about myself. - But this one knows about you. </seg>
<seg id="154"> Because I am me. </seg>
<seg id="155"> Is that my shirt? </seg>
<seg id="156"> - Why do you always copy me? - I will not copy you. </seg>
<seg id="157"> - Why do not you have your own style? - Of course I got it. </seg>
<seg id="158"> No, you always copy me. Your style is mine, because it cops me. </seg>
<seg id="159"> - It's my style. - No, it is not. </seg>
<seg id="160"> The service sucks, coffee also, music makes vomiting. </seg>
<seg id="161"> Hey. Those are my shoes! </seg>
<seg id="162"> - They are mine. - They are mine. </seg>
<seg id="163"> - Those are mine. - They are the others. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Bullshit. </seg>
<seg id="165"> - Hey. - Hey Tom. </seg>
<seg id="166"> - Good. - Well, I'm glad you did it. </seg>
<seg id="167"> - Here you are. </seg>
<seg id="168"> Call me Jim. </seg>
<seg id="169"> That is, friends call me Jim. Or Jimmy, or Iggy. </seg>
<seg id="170"> Call me J ... no, call me Iggy, Iggy. </seg>
<seg id="171"> Okay, for me it's indifferent. Jim or Iggy </seg>
<seg id="172"> Iggy. Call me Iggy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> I'm sorry to be late, Jim. Four cars one on the other. </seg>
<seg id="174"> It was a birth, this morning at nine o'clock. </seg>
<seg id="175"> I saved several lives, I was on the highway, it was ... </seg>
<seg id="176"> There is nothing worse than improvising an operation. </seg>
<seg id="177"> You know, without the right irons we become butcheries. </seg>
<seg id="178"> I did a trachon with a bureau ... </seg>
<seg id="179"> I was very busy. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Wait a second, are you a doctor? </seg>
<seg id="181"> Yes, I'm a doctor. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Music and medicine are my two great passions. </seg>
<seg id="183"> ... And at the point where they overlap, there is me. </seg>
<seg id="184"> A lot of people say they feel a lot in my music, I do not know ... </seg>
<seg id="185"> - Well, yes, I know ... - Really? </seg>
<seg id="186"> - Yeah, I can see it. - Yup? </seg>
<seg id="187"> Wow !. Sent .. It's the organization, the whole. Humanity, I think. </seg>
<seg id="188"> The humanity that is inside, of course. The feeling </seg>
<seg id="189"> So you've had a beautiful full day. Yes, one morning by a doctor </seg>
<seg id="190"> - Everybody safe? - All in shape. </seg>
<seg id="191"> - Well ... - Are you here for a long time, or am I wrong? </seg>
<seg id="192"> Yes a bit'. I drank a coffee </seg>
<seg id="193"> - I see. - I also ordered it for you. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Me too? </seg>
<seg id="195"> In short, all right. It's right? </seg>
<seg id="196"> Sure, of course, okay ... coffee </seg>
<seg id="197"> - Go for coffee. - Okay. </seg>
<seg id="198"> Strength, take some coffee. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Coffee is served. </seg>
<seg id="200"> Are your cigarettes? </seg>
<seg id="201"> They were already there when I arrived. </seg>
<seg id="202"> - You do not smoke, do not you? - Yeah. I quit. </seg>
<seg id="203"> - Me too. Madonna. - Closed. </seg>
<seg id="204"> All right, finally. After 25 years! </seg>
<seg id="205"> End. </seg>
<seg id="206"> - I did the load of energy. </seg>
<seg id="207"> - I feel great. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Since I stopped, I mean ... it's all. Refurbished. </seg>
<seg id="209"> - Centrally, bang! You know? - Me too. </seg>
<seg id="210"> I'm feeling a lot of pain for the other idiots who still smoke, you know? </seg>
<seg id="211"> - They have no willpower. - It's their soothing. </seg>
<seg id="212"> The good thing is that when it stops, it's that having stopped ... </seg>
<seg id="213"> ... I can smoke it, so I stopped. </seg>
<seg id="214"> You know, it's all an ornamental thing ... </seg>
<seg id="215"> It's not true. I did not aspire either. </seg>
<seg id="216"> Do you want to make me company? </seg>
<seg id="217"> - But yes, so I stopped ... - Well, </seg>
<seg id="218"> - Okay. Okay. - Since you've stopped. - You can smoke it. - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="219"> Of course I can, yes. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Hey, thank you! </seg>
<seg id="221"> Did you understand what I mean? Now that I've stopped ... </seg>
<seg id="222"> Damn it, coffee and cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="223"> Perfect Couple. </seg>
<seg id="224"> Unbeatable. </seg>
<seg id="225"> We are the generation of "coffee and cigarettes" if you think so well. </seg>
<seg id="226"> That of the 40s was "cake and coffee". </seg>
<seg id="227"> Like Gianni and Pinotto. They always ordered cake and coffee. </seg>
<seg id="228"> Yes, yes, like Gianni and Pinotto! They always ordered cake and coffee. </seg>
<seg id="229"> A coffee! A piece of cake and a coffee! </seg>
<seg id="230"> What are you waiting for? </seg>
<seg id="231"> come here often? </seg>
<seg id="232"> Yes, it is the place I frequent most of all. </seg>
<seg id="233"> I was wondering why there are no disks in the jukebox. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Well, if you do not like it ... we can go to Mexican fast-food. Maybe it's your kind. </seg>
<seg id="235"> What would you like, excuse me? You're saying, What are the fast-food type? </seg>
<seg id="236"> No. I said, if you do not like it ... You said you did not like it. </seg>
<seg id="237"> No, no. I did not say this. </seg>
<seg id="238"> We can go to that bar on the corner. </seg>
<seg id="239"> Maybe it's more than your own, I would not know. </seg>
<seg id="240"> But who said it? I do not want to go to the bar at the corner. </seg>
<seg id="241"> I'm fine here. </seg>
<seg id="242"> Coffee is good at that bar. </seg>
<seg id="243"> Do you like their coffee? </seg>
<seg id="244"> I drink it, I like it, do not you like it? </seg>
<seg id="245"> Of course yes. I like their coffee. </seg>
<seg id="246"> - It's fine stuff, great class. - Yes, it's good. </seg>
<seg id="247"> It's good coffee in that bar. </seg>
<seg id="248"> Wow, I was almost forgetting. Listen. </seg>
<seg id="249"> The other day I played with a drummer in Los Angeles. </seg>
<seg id="250"> It's called Giant Robo. </seg>
<seg id="251"> You do not know how strong it is, I thought of you. </seg>
<seg id="252"> Maybe you could ... I think you should hear it! Yes eh? </seg>
<seg id="253"> Why ... do you think I need a professional drummer? Am I not good enough? </seg>
<seg id="254"> Are you saying this? </seg>
<seg id="255"> No. No. I was just ... you know. I wanted to talk to you. </seg>
<seg id="256"> I just wanted to talk to you, because it's a real phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="257"> It's hard, metallic, it's strong. And so I thought, '' ah, though. '' </seg>
<seg id="258"> Are you trying to tell me that I need a drummer? </seg>
<seg id="259"> What do I need? </seg>
<seg id="260"> That the percussion of my record is sucking? What are you trying to say? </seg>
<seg id="261"> Oh, forget it. Leave it alone. </seg>
<seg id="262"> You know what? I think I have to go. </seg>
<seg id="263"> You have to go? </seg>
<seg id="264"> Maybe another coffee? Another sig ... </seg>
<seg id="265"> I would like. But no, I have to go. I really have to go. </seg>
<seg id="266"> My wife, alone in a motel. </seg>
<seg id="267"> - I understand ... - Yes, you know ... </seg>
<seg id="268"> Call her and tell her to come here. He drinks a coffee, smokes a couple of cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="269"> - Do not smoke. - It's the willpower. </seg>
<seg id="270"> - I got it. - I do not want you to start ... </seg>
<seg id="271"> - No ... I do not want it to start. </seg>
<seg id="272"> This is something among us. Right, yes ... </seg>
<seg id="273"> Well, let's ... every now and then we keep crossing. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I'll think about it, I'll think about you. </seg>
<seg id="275"> Now I have to go. Eh, I know so ... </seg>
<seg id="276"> See you soon. Yup. </seg>
<seg id="277"> I was hoping you could stop more. </seg>
<seg id="278"> - Damn, me, I ... Now that we were starting to warm up. - I have to go. </seg>
<seg id="279"> - Okay Jim. </seg>
<seg id="280"> - Next. - Yes, next time. </seg>
<seg id="281"> - Be a good boy. - You too. </seg>
<seg id="282"> There are not even his disks. </seg>
<seg id="283"> - You're a fucking whore, do you know that? - What is it now? </seg>
<seg id="284"> I can not believe you keep smoking that shit! It's incredible. </seg>
<seg id="285"> Vinny, they'll shoot you. They will kill you. Believe me. </seg>
<seg id="286"> Did you come to the world to break? </seg>
<seg id="287"> You said you stopped, but keep on spending a fortune. </seg>
<seg id="288"> And the fucking multinationals are enriched! And then you will be cancer. </seg>
<seg id="289"> So those doctors and dudes will also be enriched. </seg>
<seg id="290"> And even the seagulls! </seg>
<seg id="291"> All because you keep smoking, fucking shit. </seg>
<seg id="292"> I can not do anything about it. I'm fucking dependent, okay? </seg>
<seg id="293"> So go to coffee and cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="294"> Is that how you dine? Does not do very well, you know? </seg>
<seg id="295"> You also drink coffee, so do not break the whips! </seg>
<seg id="296"> Vinny, I've already had lunch. </seg>
<seg id="297"> I'm on diet, okay? What balls. </seg>
<seg id="298"> Here's my son's delinquent. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Give me a favor, do not tell your mother. </seg>
<seg id="300"> But what the fuck am I saying? That smokes like a steam locomotive. </seg>
<seg id="301"> How is he going? </seg>
<seg id="302"> It's not a chatter, is not it? </seg>
<seg id="303"> Lately not. It's silent </seg>
<seg id="304"> I gave you $ 10 last night, what did you do to him? </seg>
<seg id="305"> I've just given you 5. </seg>
<seg id="306"> Look, you'll still have one. Closed. </seg>
<seg id="307"> Do not you hug me? For $ 6 I do not even win a hug? </seg>
<seg id="308"> You must be fucking your brain! All right, come on, you do ... </seg>
<seg id="309"> But bought something to eat, something healthy. </seg>
<seg id="310"> Yes, like your father. Coffee and cigarettes! </seg>
<seg id="311"> Oh, but what the fuck are you saying? </seg>
<seg id="312"> Look how much fucking coffee you drink! </seg>
<seg id="313"> You got to get a fucking cock full. </seg>
<seg id="314"> And with this? They always give me a whole pot. </seg>
<seg id="315"> I like coffee. I charge her. </seg>
<seg id="316"> You charge her! You're a fucking sick! Caffeine. </seg>
<seg id="317"> Caffeine Sick. Why do not you drink coffee? </seg>
<seg id="318"> - Yes and then? </seg>
<seg id="319"> Then maybe you should try to give up. </seg>
<seg id="320"> I'm not a kid of renunciation. Fuckin 'fuckin'. </seg>
<seg id="321"> What balls, my son again. </seg>
<seg id="322"> How much did you spend? </seg>
<seg id="323"> For dried peas and a drink? </seg>
<seg id="324"> - What's in the bag? - Chinese peas. </seg>
<seg id="325"> No? </seg>
<seg id="326"> Japanese? </seg>
<seg id="327"> Chinese, Japanese ... always the same thing. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Assaggy one. </seg>
<seg id="329"> My god knows black pepper! </seg>
<seg id="330"> Give it a little ... </seg>
<seg id="331"> Small bastard! Did you see? He wanted to poison me! </seg>
<seg id="332"> But no, Joe. Listen to me. Those are so dear to me. </seg>
<seg id="333"> They are delicious, they have a special taste. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Taste a dick. </seg>
<seg id="335"> Oh God, still? </seg>
<seg id="336"> How do I light a cigarette to torment me, fuck! </seg>
<seg id="337"> Do you know what? You're really a fucking whore. </seg>
<seg id="338"> I'll thank the great multinationals of tobacco ... ... when they'll bury you. </seg>
<seg id="339"> Did I ever tell you you're worse than a fucking wife? </seg>
<seg id="340"> You can not even smoke a cigarette in holy peace. </seg>
<seg id="341"> Sorry Miss. Umm ... Can I have more coffee? </seg>
<seg id="342"> Ahh, if he did not do it was better. </seg>
<seg id="343"> It had the right color, the temperature. It was perfect </seg>
<seg id="344"> Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Hello. </seg>
<seg id="346"> Excuse me, excuse me for coffee. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Sorry. Is it called Gloria? No. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Why did I think maybe ... It's probably not the friend of ... </seg>
<seg id="349"> Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="350"> Can I bring you something else? </seg>
<seg id="351"> A sandwich, something to eat ... ... along with coffee? </seg>
<seg id="352"> Coffee and cigarettes is not a very healthy lunch. </seg>
<seg id="353"> It's not my lunch, okay? </seg>
<seg id="354"> Excuse me. </seg>
<seg id="355"> Alex. </seg>
<seg id="356"> You scared me. </seg>
<seg id="357"> How's it going, Isaach? </seg>
<seg id="358"> All right? Very well. </seg>
<seg id="359"> I'm happy to see you. </seg>
<seg id="360"> I was so tired of staying in Paris. You can not imagine. </seg>
<seg id="361"> Sit down. </seg>
<seg id="362"> I'm glad you called me. </seg>
<seg id="363"> It's a lot we do not see. No? </seg>
<seg id="364"> I'll take you a coffee. All right? Of course, thank you. </seg>
<seg id="365"> So is everything okay? </seg>
<seg id="366"> Yes. It's all right, really fine. </seg>
<seg id="367"> I'm fine. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Are you sure everything is okay? </seg>
<seg id="369"> Yes. It's all right. </seg>
<seg id="370"> And how are you? </seg>
<seg id="371"> I? All right. </seg>
<seg id="372"> Not at all, but pretty well. </seg>
<seg id="373"> I'm delighted to see you. </seg>
<seg id="374"> Me too. </seg>
<seg id="375"> Since it was quite a while we did not see it ... </seg>
<seg id="376"> ... and you called me out of nowhere by saying "let's see". I thought you got hurt in some trouble. </seg>
<seg id="377"> No. I just wanted to see you, all here. </seg>
<seg id="378"> Me too. I wanted to see you too. </seg>
<seg id="379"> Are you sure there is nothing that is worrying about you? </seg>
<seg id="380"> And why, </seg>
<seg id="381"> Must there be something for something? Of course not. </seg>
<seg id="382"> But when you called me, I thought there was something. </seg>
<seg id="383"> Something that maybe ... you need to tell me. Here, all here. </seg>
<seg id="384"> Isaach. Everything is alright. Really </seg>
<seg id="385"> Okay? </seg>
<seg id="386"> Are you sure? </seg>
<seg id="387"> Are you crazy, Isaach? </seg>
<seg id="388"> Sure that there is nothing ... </seg>
<seg id="389"> of which do you want to lighten up? </seg>
<seg id="390"> Do I have to invent something? If you want I can invent something bad. </seg>
<seg id="391"> No, we would miss ... I do not want you to invent anything. </seg>
<seg id="392"> You know, I'm your best friend </seg>
<seg id="393"> I want you to feel completely free to tell me the truth. </seg>
<seg id="394"> Tell me what you're worried about. </seg>
<seg id="395"> Can you stop breaking the balls? </seg>
<seg id="396"> Okay, I understand. I do not insist. </seg>
<seg id="397"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="398"> You are welcome. </seg>
<seg id="399"> Isaach, there is no problem. </seg>
<seg id="400"> Well, I know I'm going. </seg>
<seg id="401"> Already? </seg>
<seg id="402"> Yes, if I do not want to talk to you, I do not want it to be a problem. </seg>
<seg id="403"> There are no problems, Isaach. I got it? No problem. </seg>
<seg id="404"> understand, but listen. </seg>
<seg id="405"> If you do not want to talk to me now, call me whenever you want ... do you understand? </seg>
<seg id="406"> Maybe now is not the best time for you. </seg>
<seg id="407"> I was happy to see you. </seg>
<seg id="408"> Yes me too. </seg>
<seg id="409"> I'm sorry to disappoint you. But there's nothing wrong with it. </seg>
<seg id="410"> All right. </seg>
<seg id="411"> I get it. </seg>
<seg id="412"> No, you did not understand. </seg>
<seg id="413"> Call me when you want, Alex. </seg>
<seg id="414"> See you, Isaach. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Soon. </seg>
<seg id="416"> - Hello, what a pleasure to see you again. - Me too. </seg>
<seg id="417"> Centuries have passed. </seg>
<seg id="418"> Already. When was the last time? A couple of years ago in Sidney, did not you? </seg>
<seg id="419"> Two years ago, really? </seg>
<seg id="420"> Wow. How was Jeff and Beryl? </seg>
<seg id="421"> Usually, as usual. </seg>
<seg id="422"> Faithful to their strangeness by parents. </seg>
<seg id="423"> Do not Mr. Cate and his son travel with you? </seg>
<seg id="424"> Well, unfortunately. I'm alone. I'll see them next week. </seg>
<seg id="425"> - They are fine? - Yes, yes. I also want a child sooner or later. </seg>
<seg id="426"> What can I bring you? What do you want, Catie? </seg>
<seg id="427"> Oh, could I have an espresso? In big cup. </seg>
<seg id="428"> Even for me an espresso, double. Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="429"> And could I have some milk apart? Can you warm it up? </seg>
<seg id="430"> - We will do our utmost to please you. - Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Sorry for the delay. I know you only have ten minutes. </seg>
<seg id="432"> Do not worry. I wish I could be more. </seg>
<seg id="433"> Do you sleep here? Or do you see only journalists here? Make your number and away. </seg>
<seg id="434"> Oh no. I sleep here. And I do the interviews. </seg>
<seg id="435"> we do it in my suite, it's more convenient. </seg>
<seg id="436"> Since they are preparing the next one, I thought it would be nice to see you here. </seg>
<seg id="437"> No, thanks to Shelly, here you can not ... </seg>
<seg id="438"> Stop it. Do you want them tell you not to smoke? </seg>
<seg id="439"> - Go, cousin. - Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="440"> In short, they give you this megasuite, and then use it for advertising? </seg>
<seg id="441"> Exact. </seg>
<seg id="442"> It seems ... shabby. Well, it's still a suite, they split the spaces. </seg>
<seg id="443"> Yes, but could they take one for you and another for press meetings? </seg>
<seg id="444"> It's a cheap production. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Sure. </seg>
<seg id="446"> But it's still shabby. </seg>
<seg id="447"> Can I bring you anything else? </seg>
<seg id="448"> - No thanks, just like that. - You're welcome. </seg>
<seg id="449"> And so ... Entering was complicated, I risked not to do so until they realized I was your cousin. </seg>
<seg id="450"> There are several paparazzi underneath. </seg>
<seg id="451"> They will follow you everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="452"> Everywhere there are so-called "celebrities," I suppose. </seg>
<seg id="453"> Of course it must be a nice break of balls at times, no? </seg>
<seg id="454"> Not for me, I'm free! </seg>
<seg id="455"> Virtually in panties, but free. </seg>
<seg id="456"> No one runs here, it's a safe place. </seg>
<seg id="457"> Except when they swap for you. </seg>
<seg id="458"> Once they made me into a club because they thought I was you. </seg>
<seg id="459"> Then they understood and kicked me out. </seg>
<seg id="460"> What a fucking thing. </seg>
<seg id="461"> Do not deny it, it must be beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="462"> You have everything. You have a husband, a nice kid. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Turn around the world, stay in fantastic hotels. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Frequent parties and receptions ... </seg>
<seg id="465"> Well, you know the saying, "The neighbor's grass is getting greener." </seg>
<seg id="466"> And how it is ... </seg>
<seg id="467"> Shit. </seg>
<seg id="468"> - Johnny. - Who? </seg>
<seg id="469"> Jimmy ... Tim ... Tommy. Sorry, how are you? Ah, Tommy ... </seg>
<seg id="470"> We left it two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Tommy. What a fucking head. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Now I'm with another, Lee. Remember? </seg>
<seg id="473"> Sounds in a group, I wrote to him. </seg>
<seg id="474"> It's an important part of my life. </seg>
<seg id="475"> Sorry, Shell, but you did not write to me. </seg>
<seg id="476"> Yeah fucking, I also sent you his CD! </seg>
<seg id="477"> Your secretary will not give it to you. </seg>
<seg id="478"> It does nothing, it does not matter. I know how your life is messed up </seg>
<seg id="479"> Do you remember when you sent it? No. One week you're at L.A, </seg>
<seg id="480"> Then in London, then in Sidney. </seg>
<seg id="481"> Fuck, every day you're in a different city. </seg>
<seg id="482"> I'd love to hear what she is doing, what kind of thing is it? </seg>
<seg id="483"> Well, it's stuff ... </seg>
<seg id="484"> It lasts ... </seg>
<seg id="485"> ... industrial, vibrant ... </seg>
<seg id="486"> I do not think you'd appreciate it. </seg>
<seg id="487"> How is the group called? Squrl. </seg>
<seg id="488"> Scuali. </seg>
<seg id="489"> No. Sqürl. Here they say so. </seg>
<seg id="490"> S-ü-q-r-l. On U you will know it. Squrl. </seg>
<seg id="491"> Oh Sqürl. I get it. </seg>
<seg id="492"> Can I buy the CD, if I do not find what you sent me? </seg>
<seg id="493"> No not yet. In the sense, they have incised it for trial. Then... </seg>
<seg id="494"> But I think the record company will make it out at last. </seg>
<seg id="495"> I think. </seg>
<seg id="496"> I have to find that CD at all costs so that I can give it a lifetime. </seg>
<seg id="497"> You never will. </seg>
<seg id="498"> Shell, you're bad, really ... </seg>
<seg id="499"> It's the truth, you will not find it. If you say so. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Also because I remembered now that in fact ... I did not send it to you. </seg>
<seg id="501"> I just thought about shipping. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Oh, I almost forgot. This is for you. </seg>
<seg id="503"> Thank you, what is it? </seg>
<seg id="504"> Ah, though, it's expensive stuff! You will be ruined! </seg>
<seg id="505"> Awesome, thank you very much. It makes me comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="506"> It will make me look like a movie star. </seg>
<seg id="507"> - Cheers. - Cin cin, beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="508"> Catie, seriously, thank you for this visit. </seg>
<seg id="509"> No thank you. </seg>
<seg id="510"> And thank you for the gift. </seg>
<seg id="511"> Imagine, nothing. </seg>
<seg id="512"> It's a promotional gift, right? </seg>
<seg id="513"> They will give you everything for free, no. Jewelery, clothes ... probably even cars ... </seg>
<seg id="514"> No, cars have never given me. Every once in a while I get cosmetics for gift, but I thought ... ... I do not know, I wanted ... </seg>
<seg id="515"> I never had time to shop. </seg>
<seg id="516"> Do not worry, I like it. And then it's stuff you need </seg>
<seg id="517"> Do not you think it's fun? when something you can not afford ... ... costs a lot. </seg>
<seg id="518"> And when you can do it ... ... it's free. </seg>
<seg id="519"> Do not you feel absurd? </seg>
<seg id="520"> The world is a bit like that. In many ways. </seg>
<seg id="521"> Oh, about paparazzi, </seg>
<seg id="522"> The other day I saw your photos in the newspaper. </seg>
<seg id="523"> Do not even name me ... </seg>
<seg id="524"> How was she dressed? </seg>
<seg id="525"> Sorry... </seg>
<seg id="526"> Ready? Hi Lindsey. </seg>
<seg id="527"> I'm down at the bar, with my cousin, Shelly. </seg>
<seg id="528"> Already ready, really? </seg>
<seg id="529"> Okay, in a minute I'm up. Hello. </seg>
<seg id="530"> - Back to work? - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="531"> You go back to the mine. </seg>
<seg id="532"> Do you want to come with me? </seg>
<seg id="533"> Nothing interesting, but if you want to come to me does a lot of pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="534"> Looking at you as you interview TV? </seg>
<seg id="535"> What's "Everything Doing"? </seg>
<seg id="536"> Yes. You could send me that CD, I have a letter. </seg>
<seg id="537"> You would not read it. Stop it, if I send it I'll read it. </seg>
<seg id="538"> - Now I have to go. - Yeah. - I'm sorry. </seg>
<seg id="539"> - Yeah. - It was nice to see you. - Yes. - Do you have my numbers? - Sure. </seg>
<seg id="540"> Be good. Hug me all. </seg>
<seg id="541"> And you hug the others. </seg>
<seg id="542"> Always remember me. </seg>
<seg id="543"> - Hello Catie. - We'll see Shell. </seg>
<seg id="544"> Put it all on my account, if you add more as well. </seg>
<seg id="545"> Maybe next time, Lou is there. Sure. </seg>
<seg id="546"> It's called Lee. </seg>
<seg id="547"> Ahh, sorry. </seg>
<seg id="548"> Can I have a double tequila, thanks? And the menu. </seg>
<seg id="549"> Excuse me, here's no smoking. </seg>
<seg id="550"> So, Jack, do not you talk about your Tesla coil? </seg>
<seg id="551"> You said you did not want to talk to me. </seg>
<seg id="552"> Yes I know. Before. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Now I do not know if I still want to talk about it. </seg>
<seg id="554"> Give Jack. You dragged her up here with your pickup truck. </seg>
<seg id="555"> Up, parlamene. </seg>
<seg id="556"> To create it, I have followed the inventions of the inventor, Nikola Tesla. </seg>
<seg id="557"> It's a transformer ... ... with two coils tuned to resonate. </seg>
<seg id="558"> In pairs it is a progressive transformer ... ... that converts current from low to high voltage, and vice versa. At high frequencies. </seg>
<seg id="559"> Do you remember that when we were young, did you have the mirror to make up for Barbie? </seg>
<seg id="560"> Yes, I remember it. </seg>
<seg id="561"> There was a small fluorescent lamp. </seg>
<seg id="562"> Well, Nikola Tesla invented that light. </seg>
<seg id="563"> Without him we would not have the alternating current ... ... the radio, the TV, the X-rays the induction motor, the particle accelerator, the laser. </seg>
<seg id="564"> Without him, there would be none of these things. </seg>
<seg id="565"> Not even the rock band, the Tesla. </seg>
<seg id="566"> Funny. </seg>
<seg id="567"> Tesla was a real genius. </seg>
<seg id="568"> If they had paid more attention to his ideas ... Now the world would be better: mass free communications Free shipping. Free energy for everyone. </seg>
<seg id="569"> That's why, in the end, they set it apart. For free energy. </seg>
<seg id="570"> He perceived the earth ... ... like an acoustic resonator. </seg>
<seg id="571"> Beautiful idea. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Then you show me how the coil works? </seg>
<seg id="573"> Sure. </seg>
<seg id="574"> You need these. </seg>
<seg id="575"> - Okay, are you ready for Meg? - Ready. </seg>
<seg id="576"> Fuck! Something must have been broken. </seg>
<seg id="577"> Nice stuff, though. </seg>
<seg id="578"> Yes, but it is not scheduled to stop. But to go on What will happen. </seg>
<seg id="579"> Is not that you burned the condenser? </seg>
<seg id="580"> No, I did not burn a condenser, Meg. </seg>
<seg id="581"> Maybe the difference was missed. </seg>
<seg id="582"> Yes, "The lifesaver." </seg>
<seg id="583"> I know what a difference! But it does not matter. </seg>
<seg id="584"> Do not pity with me. </seg>
<seg id="585"> Maybe the spinterometers are too distant on the induction spool. </seg>
<seg id="586"> It could be. </seg>
<seg id="587"> I think. </seg>
<seg id="588"> Yes, that's for that. You are right. </seg>
<seg id="589"> That's one thing I did not control. </seg>
<seg id="590"> Well, I go home to see how to fix it. </seg>
<seg id="591"> Tomorrow you go to bowling? Yes, I find it there. </seg>
<seg id="592"> Perfect, let's see it then. </seg>
<seg id="593"> Earth as an acoustic resonant conductor. </seg>
<seg id="594"> Ready? Ready, who are you? </seg>
<seg id="595"> Laura, hello. I'm Alfred Molina, I was looking for Steve Coogan. </seg>
<seg id="596"> Alfred Molina. </seg>
<seg id="597"> M-o-l-i-n-a. </seg>
<seg id="598"> The actor, of course. I wanted to be sure Steve remembers ... </seg>
<seg id="599"> ... Ah yes, fine !. </seg>
<seg id="600"> Casomai would serve, my number is Ready? </seg>
<seg id="601"> Hello, Alfred? Hi, Steve. </seg>
<seg id="602"> Hello! I'm so glad you did it, sit down! </seg>
<seg id="603"> I was talking to Laura, your assistant, I was wondering if you were coming. </seg>
<seg id="604"> - Here I am. - Fantastic. </seg>
<seg id="605"> I ordered tea. </seg>
<seg id="606"> Do I make you from mom? </seg>
<seg id="607"> Let me stay, I'll do it from Mom alone. </seg>
<seg id="608"> Here is milk. </seg>
<seg id="609"> - A real tea! - Yeah ... </seg>
<seg id="610"> It's hard to get used to it. </seg>
<seg id="611"> I have this idea ... ... if I ever win an Oscar, or a GOlden Globe, </seg>
<seg id="612"> I want to take the satisfaction of teaching yankee to do a good job. </seg>
<seg id="613"> - Tea made as it should be. - cheers. </seg>
<seg id="614"> I love .. I love your overcoat. </seg>
<seg id="615"> It's a Westwood. Viv Westwood. </seg>
<seg id="616"> I have a weakness for British designers. </seg>
<seg id="617"> I do not know what goes on in the head of the American ones. </seg>
<seg id="618"> Are too much, how to say? Cautious. </seg>
<seg id="619"> Are not you hot? Outside there are 30 °. </seg>
<seg id="620"> - When I get out I'll take it off. - Oh. </seg>
<seg id="621"> - It's for air conditioning. - Right. </seg>
<seg id="622"> How much are you living here in L. A? It's been around 7 years. </seg>
<seg id="623"> - Wow. - I really like it here. </seg>
<seg id="624"> It's a long time now. I like to come out every now and then. </seg>
<seg id="625"> As I always say, it is nice to live but to go even further. </seg>
<seg id="626"> The palm trees ... The palms make me really crap. </seg>
<seg id="627"> It's not a place for everyone. </seg>
<seg id="628"> I do not mind, but I came especially for work. </seg>
<seg id="629"> It's nice ... it's nice to meet you, finally. </seg>
<seg id="630"> I have to admit that I'm your big fan. </seg>
<seg id="631"> All your shows, from things to TV and comedies ... </seg>
<seg id="632"> I have them all in the box. Let me ship it, great. </seg>
<seg id="633"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="634"> You know ... It's reciprocal, I know who you are. </seg>
<seg id="635"> Ah, thank you. </seg>
<seg id="636"> I've seen the TV series you did. </seg>
<seg id="637"> Really? </seg>
<seg id="638"> - Yeah. - Wow. Interesting. </seg>
<seg id="639"> - They canceled us. - I heard it. </seg>
<seg id="640"> Making comedies is a tough thing. </seg>
<seg id="641"> Yes. However, your career seems to be fine. That is, you've got a lot of success lately. </seg>
<seg id="642"> - Yeah. - And for this? </seg>
<seg id="643"> - Well, you know ... the usual rounds of meetings. </seg>
<seg id="644"> It's nice that "finally" ... ... people started to notice me. </seg>
<seg id="645"> - Have you made interesting offers? - Yup... </seg>
<seg id="646"> I have to confess ... you were great in '24 Hour '... </seg>
<seg id="647"> Really "24 Hour Party People". - It's a great job. - Thanks so much. </seg>
<seg id="648"> - A real bomb. - Has been... </seg>
<seg id="649"> And the reviews. </seg>
<seg id="650"> Fuck, they were all positive. </seg>
<seg id="651"> I am surprised that so many people have read cultural references of all kinds. </seg>
<seg id="652"> A kind of Manchester early 80s, the music scene ... </seg>
<seg id="653"> Surprising. </seg>
<seg id="654"> Because they were so many to have no references </seg>
<seg id="655"> Because of .. Maybe they know rock groups </seg>
<seg id="656"> But the whole, your character, the fact that he leads the show ... </seg>
<seg id="657"> Would you like a cigarette? </seg>
<seg id="658"> - I'm sorry, but I'm French. - Anyway, thank you. </seg>
<seg id="659"> I hold it for later. </seg>
<seg id="660"> Oh, okay. </seg>
<seg id="661"> Laura said ... ... that you were not in the skin for our encounter, but he did not tell me why. </seg>
<seg id="662"> I did not want to talk on the phone because it might seem strange. </seg>
<seg id="663"> Imagine what she would have thought, for her I was an alien. </seg>
<seg id="664"> The phone, never seen or heard at all, "I would like to talk to Steve Coogan" </seg>
<seg id="665"> But I wanted to see you personally. </seg>
<seg id="666"> Knowing they came for a while here ... </seg>
<seg id="667"> I thought it would be the perfect time ... </seg>
<seg id="668"> Anyway, I get to the point. I'm so excited! </seg>
<seg id="669"> I'm a premise ... I've always had a weakness for history. you know, and how people lived. ... and for all the events that take us from A to B. </seg>
<seg id="670"> The details of people's lives are full of epic ... ... full of epic qualities, do you follow me? </seg>
<seg id="671"> So I started this research. </seg>
<seg id="672"> And in short ... this is the result. </seg>
<seg id="673"> And to what extent is it? Is this a project already funded or being treated? How do you proceed? </seg>
<seg id="674"> No apology, which embarrassment ... is not ... </seg>
<seg id="675"> It's not work, work has nothing to do with it. It's not a script </seg>
<seg id="676"> It's a genealogy research. And what I've discovered is that ... </seg>
<seg id="677"> Mr Coogan? Yup? </seg>
<seg id="678"> - Is she right? - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="679"> I'm a big fan of it. Not so great at the end. </seg>
<seg id="680"> Could I ask for an autograph? - Sure. - How beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="681"> I was recognized, where did she want it? </seg>
<seg id="682"> A piece of paper will go more than well. Sin. </seg>
<seg id="683"> - Oh, no. Not here. - Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="684"> - I should have something in my bag. - Okay. </seg>
<seg id="685"> Give me a second. </seg>
<seg id="686"> Oh God, excuse me. It's all right. </seg>
<seg id="687"> - Give me another minute. - How much you want. </seg>
<seg id="688"> Here, here for courtesy. - Okay, what's your name? - Katy. </seg>
<seg id="689"> - Katy. - With Y. </seg>
<seg id="690"> Then "To Katy ..." </seg>
<seg id="691"> - Hello. - Alfred is also an actor. </seg>
<seg id="692"> - Yup? - Thank you, that's beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="693"> - Thanks so much. - Do not mention it. </seg>
<seg id="694"> - Wow ... - Let's go back to us. </seg>
<seg id="695"> I do not want to steal you too long. - I know you're very busy ... - Right. </seg>
<seg id="696"> As I was saying, I did genealogical research. </seg>
<seg id="697"> I did it just for my own interest ... I was not looking for anything special. And I came across this. </seg>
<seg id="698"> I'll let you short. Steve Coogan ... </seg>
<seg id="699"> Drumroll. </seg>
<seg id="700"> The fact is this. </seg>
<seg id="701"> We're cousins. </seg>
<seg id="702"> What do you mean? Artistically? </seg>
<seg id="703"> No. No. No! In the normal sense. We are cousins, relatives. </seg>
<seg id="704"> Wow. - Is not it fantastic? - Of course, but ... are you sure? </seg>
<seg id="705"> Things would be so ... </seg>
<seg id="706"> My grandpa is your pro-god. </seg>
<seg id="707"> And, going further, we have a common bis-bis-great-grandfather. </seg>
<seg id="708"> Ah, though! Of course my ancestors are Irish, but I also knew an Italian ... </seg>
<seg id="709"> Back to all! The Italian ancestor is our bis-bis-bis-great-grandfather, Giuseppe. </seg>
<seg id="710"> - Wow. - It's incredible? </seg>
<seg id="711"> There are a lot of details. </seg>
<seg id="712"> It is my field, more or less, I enjoy it. Fantastic. </seg>
<seg id="713"> For me it would be amazing to say that I'm relative to Steve Coogan. </seg>
<seg id="714"> And I, in turn, can say that I'm relative to Albert Molina. </seg>
<seg id="715"> Alfred. </seg>
<seg id="716"> Yes ... It's actually my grandmother ... ... the most ferret. </seg>
<seg id="717"> It will go into ecstasy. It's your fan. He adored you in ... </seg>
<seg id="718"> Boogie Nights. </seg>
<seg id="719"> Ah, yes, with shorts and doubles? </seg>
<seg id="720"> Once he spoke to me. </seg>
<seg id="721"> What a beauty, I understand that I find you a little lacking. But think about how many possibilities. </seg>
<seg id="722"> It's great, sorry, let's make the point. </seg>
<seg id="723"> We are both actors. We are cousins, and now it's crazy. </seg>
<seg id="724"> We could ... you know, work together. </seg>
<seg id="725"> We could make a movie. </seg>
<seg id="726"> We could make a movie about our story. </seg>
<seg id="727"> The story of two actors who find themselves cousins. </seg>
<seg id="728"> We could interpret ourselves. </seg>
<seg id="729"> We'll be Fred Molina and Coog ... We'll be cousins ​​in life and ... In the movie. Is fantastic! </seg>
<seg id="730"> It would be wonderful! Absolutely gorgeous! </seg>
<seg id="731"> Or no, I mean ... we could only attend. </seg>
<seg id="732"> One day we should go drinking a beer, think about that beauty. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Maybe make a nice vacation together. Only we two, you know, to know us. </seg>
<seg id="734"> You're not homosexual, right? </seg>
<seg id="735"> No. No. No, no. I'm, I'm married. </seg>
<seg id="736"> Even James I, if that's what you mean. </seg>
<seg id="737"> Sorry, I came out like this. </seg>
<seg id="738"> You say it and do not think about it, follow me? I see. </seg>
<seg id="739"> I know exactly what you were thinking. </seg>
<seg id="740"> If someone is presenting me saying he's my cousin ... </seg>
<seg id="741"> I would take it for crazy. But quiet, I'm not. </seg>
<seg id="742"> I think for me it's a fantastic, exciting excerpt. </seg>
<seg id="743"> Absolutely. </seg>
<seg id="744"> - I just wanted you to know. - Same to you. </seg>
<seg id="745"> What I ask you is to take note of this extraordinary fact. And ... to love me. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Agree. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Now I have to go. </seg>
<seg id="748"> I did not tell you ... ... but I have a meeting, I moved it. I see. </seg>
<seg id="749"> At Universal. Administrative, lenders. </seg>
<seg id="750"> So ... That would be, would ... - It's for you. - Good. It's yours. </seg>
<seg id="751"> I will check that I do not lose it. Sure. </seg>
<seg id="752"> You stay here for a couple of days, right? </seg>
<seg id="753"> If so we could see it again before your departure. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Yes, ah ... ok, check in my mental agenda </seg>
<seg id="755"> I'm afraid that's not possible. </seg>
<seg id="756"> For the days when I'm here, I'm always busy. - I see. - I'm very busy. Listen to me, no problem. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Give me your cell phone number, I'll call you back before you tell me. </seg>
<seg id="758"> There is a problem. On the ... </seg>
<seg id="759"> Here's a band system that's different ... ... from the English one. It's a casino, our cell phones </seg>
<seg id="760"> Our cell phones here do not work. Here in the US they are cell phone, practically. I understand, well ... give me your home number, I'll call you there. </seg>
<seg id="761"> - You have my assistant's number, right? - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="762"> Well then, we're in touch. </seg>
<seg id="763"> Could not you give me your home number? </seg>
<seg id="764"> Can I say no? There is absolutely nothing ... ... nothing personal. Only... </seg>
<seg id="765"> I never gave my house number to anyone. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Defense of personal space, always avoided ... It's a rule. </seg>
<seg id="767"> ... And I always think, "Follow the rule." You understand, do not you? </seg>
<seg id="768"> Treat yourself to the rule. In fact, it's more a philosophy than a rule. </seg>
<seg id="769"> I can boast ... that I have refused my number ... ... to several V.I.P., in the past </seg>
<seg id="770"> Once I even refused to Sam Mendes, then you have company. </seg>
<seg id="771"> If it's okay for Sam Mendes, that's fine for me. </seg>
<seg id="772"> Exactly. - I know it's mine. - Sure, mine does not work. </seg>
<seg id="773"> Sorry, but I have to answer. </seg>
<seg id="774"> Ready? </seg>
<seg id="775"> Yes sure. </seg>
<seg id="776"> Spike, hello, how are you doing? </seg>
<seg id="777"> Yes, did you receive the message? </seg>
<seg id="778"> My agent wanted a confirmation. </seg>
<seg id="779"> No, the producer does not have a good reputation ... we have to be careful of everything, artistic integrity, and all that stuff there. </seg>
<seg id="780"> Otherwise everything will get out of hand. </seg>
<seg id="781"> How much are you asshole. </seg>
<seg id="782"> All right, Sunday is confirmed? </seg>
<seg id="783"> Fine, can we see you there? </seg>
<seg id="784"> Better as soon as possible. Perfect. A hug. Hi Spike. </seg>
<seg id="785"> - You have to apologize. - Do not even mention it. </seg>
<seg id="786"> But ... that ... was ... was Spike Lee? </seg>
<seg id="787"> Oh no, no, no. I do not know Spike Lee. No, it was Spike Jonze. </seg>
<seg id="788"> - Spike Jonze! - I love it! - He's a good man, Spike. </seg>
<seg id="789"> We are friends from a lifetime. </seg>
<seg id="790"> In addition to enthusiastic hikers. I boring you. No, no, no, continue. </seg>
<seg id="791"> We belong to a club. And on weekends we walk in the middle of nature. </seg>
<seg id="792"> He is a very convivial environmentalist. </seg>
<seg id="793"> Spike Jonze is a paladin of organic foods ... Jesus, I had never seen him in this light. </seg>
<seg id="794"> He prefers to be called "green". Like me, by the way. </seg>
<seg id="795"> Of course, I do not misunderstand ... ... it's beautiful, I love the trees. </seg>
<seg id="796"> Maybe there were more. Paper is used on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="797"> I'd love ... you know, I want to abolish the phone number rule ... it's bullshit. </seg>
<seg id="798"> Would it be rude to give it to you now? </seg>
<seg id="799"> Yes, that's fine. Right. </seg>
<seg id="800"> I have to go, sorry. </seg>
<seg id="801"> - I think in the bill. - Good. </seg>
<seg id="802"> 'Fuck ... </seg>
<seg id="803"> Do you think RZA, where the fuck are you? </seg>
<seg id="804"> - Hey, hey, pace. - Bobby ... </seg>
<seg id="805"> Sorry, late, cousin. Do not worry, I was going to call you. What a fuck, an emergency visit. </seg>
<seg id="806"> - Emergency visit? - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="807"> The sons of Sophia and Sifu took the virus. </seg>
<seg id="808"> So I went to give her herbal medicines. </seg>
<seg id="809"> I took it away from milk and its derivatives, only citric acid ... ... should heal quickly. </seg>
<seg id="810"> Since you are a doctor? I've already said! </seg>
<seg id="811"> I've been studying alternative medicine for two years. </seg>
<seg id="812"> Ancient healing techniques, and such things. </seg>
<seg id="813"> Listen to this. There is a procedure I could run using a drill. </seg>
<seg id="814"> An electric drill. I'm serious. </seg>
<seg id="815"> And then, having made the DJ with my hands the cable. </seg>
<seg id="816"> Music and medicine for me go hand in hand. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Like two planets in orbit around the same sun. </seg>
<seg id="818"> - Do you want some tea? - Thanks, thank you </seg>
<seg id="819"> It's herbs, no caffeine. </seg>
<seg id="820"> No caffeine. It's absurd. Do not say that to me. </seg>
<seg id="821"> Trust, depression comes. And makes it irritable. </seg>
<seg id="822"> Accelerates your pulse, heartbeat, you understand? </seg>
<seg id="823"> And, worse, every time you have a coffee fill your body of shit. </seg>
<seg id="824"> Do you know the point? That's why I try to stay away. </seg>
<seg id="825"> I stopped with that shit. - Clean and healthy: no caffeine. </seg>
<seg id="826"> - To the Liquid Swords, cousin. - Bobby Digital. </seg>
<seg id="827"> - Wu-Tang forever. - Wu-Tang forever. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Does anyone still want coffee? </seg>
<seg id="829"> - The kitchen closes. - No, we do not poison ourselves with caffeine. </seg>
<seg id="830"> - Well? - No. </seg>
<seg id="831"> Do you know that caffeine causes delirium? </seg>
<seg id="832"> - Delirious? - Even in serious shape. </seg>
<seg id="833"> Now I understand everything! It may be this: delusion. </seg>
<seg id="834"> Are not you Bill Murray? This ... are you Bill Murray? Yes, I'm Bill Murray, but what's left between us, you know? You stay with us. </seg>
<seg id="835"> And between you two there is some connection? </seg>
<seg id="836"> Yes, we are cousins. </seg>
<seg id="837"> You're taking me for the ass, you're two planks. </seg>
<seg id="838"> - Piantagrane! - Del Wu-Tang clan. </seg>
<seg id="839"> Yes, Wu-Tang Clan. </seg>
<seg id="840"> - You are GZA, the genius. - Right. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - And you are RZA ... - Aka? </seg>
<seg id="842"> Bobby Digital. He knows everything about hip-hop, yo knows everything about hip-hop. </seg>
<seg id="843"> And you are Bill Murray. </seg>
<seg id="844"> "Resumed from head" Murray "Inculafantasmi" Murray </seg>
<seg id="845"> - Great name! - I know who I am, do not say it. </seg>
<seg id="846"> What does it mean, "Do not fuck him," you see you're Bill Murray. </seg>
<seg id="847"> There goes a lot of people here and they will recognize you. You're Bill Murray, of course. </seg>
<seg id="848"> Unless you dress, or something. </seg>
<seg id="849"> In a sense, I'm disguised. </seg>
<seg id="850"> Of course it's ugly, huh? </seg>
<seg id="851"> You're really a caffeine-dependent. What's left between us, cigars. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Before I quit ... ... I liked drinking it before going to sleep. Accelerated dreams. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Like in Indianapolis, with cameras on racing cars. And they too. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Everything went fast, like dreams. </seg>
<seg id="855"> - What a stupid thing. - She's stupid, huh? </seg>
<seg id="856"> I know a guy who freezes coffee, and puts us sticks ... and he's got a nice icicle. - A cauliflower icicle. </seg>
<seg id="857"> Damn ... I do not like much, Bill Murray! </seg>
<seg id="858"> No, it's not the flu, it's the smoker's cough. </seg>
<seg id="859"> That's what I was telling you. Nicotine. Nicotine interacts with the central nervous system, with the respiratory system. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Already in minimal doses gives paralysis. </seg>
<seg id="861"> - Really? - Yes, really. </seg>
<seg id="862"> It has been shown that only 50 milligrams ... can be fatal in a few minutes. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - And how many in a cigarette? - 3 milligrams. </seg>
<seg id="864"> And did you know that nicotine is also used as an insecticide? He kills the bugs. It's not bad if he kills the bugs, right? </seg>
<seg id="865"> Are you a bug, Bill Murray? </seg>
<seg id="866"> - Holy God, RZA, speak like my doctor. - He's a doctor ... </seg>
<seg id="867"> Currently specialized in ... alternative medicine. </seg>
<seg id="868"> That is, alternative to this country. </seg>
<seg id="869"> Well, make me a favor: Do not tell me I'm here. </seg>
<seg id="870"> - You can trust Bill Murray. - What's up, Bill Murray, hide you? Yes, more or less. </seg>
<seg id="871"> I start to think it's delirium. </seg>
<seg id="872"> - Severe delusions. - Women. </seg>
<seg id="873"> If you are going to run away, I have something to help you. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Here. </seg>
<seg id="875"> - Use whatever you want. - Caspita! </seg>
<seg id="876"> Stay calm, make you invisible. It's a good deal. You did not have to, it's amazing. </seg>
<seg id="877"> All for you, Bill </seg>
<seg id="878"> - Thank you. - Imagine. </seg>
<seg id="879"> I appreciate it. </seg>
<seg id="880"> Is fantastic. </seg>
<seg id="881"> Doctor, what can I do for this cough? </seg>
<seg id="882"> I was thinking about it now. Listen to me well. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - Take hydrogenated water. - We have it for the small wounds. </seg>
<seg id="884"> Mix half the hydrogen peroxide and half the tap water. </seg>
<seg id="885"> And then you make a gargle. Spit it. </seg>
<seg id="886"> Do not let her down, Bill Murray. </seg>
<seg id="887"> And if it does not work, try it with acid. </seg>
<seg id="888"> There I also have that. </seg>
<seg id="889"> - Thank you. - Imagine. </seg>
<seg id="890"> Thanks, I'll try it right away. </seg>
<seg id="891"> - Great. - Great. </seg>
<seg id="892"> Bill "rattinculo" Murray! Crazy. </seg>
<seg id="893"> - Yo. Yo. Yo. Yo, I'm three. - And with that? </seg>
<seg id="894"> Ghosts should arrive at three o'clock. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Be quiet, put your heart in peace. It's never punctual. </seg>
<seg id="896"> We'll be here all night. Do you think we can make a joint? </seg>
<seg id="897"> No, there's a lot of police here. But once we smoked here. </seg>
<seg id="898"> As long as Dirt Dog has not bothered the place. </seg>
<seg id="899"> I told him at Deflon "Do not let Dirt Dog get in here." </seg>
<seg id="900"> And then what? </seg>
<seg id="901"> - Let's go to the studio. - Right, check out? - Yeah. - It's gone then. </seg>
<seg id="902"> No account, we have limited credit. - He does not need money. - We still pay. </seg>
<seg id="903"> What do I do, leave him a tip? </seg>
<seg id="904"> You say he's using acid? I do not know, but let's get rid of the dick. </seg>
<seg id="905"> Are you okay, Taylor? </seg>
<seg id="906"> Not too much. What's up? </seg>
<seg id="907"> I do not know. I feel divorced from the world. </seg>
<seg id="908"> I lost contact with the world. </seg>
<seg id="909"> Do you know that Mahler song? </seg>
<seg id="910"> "I've Lost the Track Of The World"? (Of the world I have lost every trace) No. </seg>
<seg id="911"> It's one of the most beautiful ... and sad songs have never been written. </seg>
<seg id="912"> It almost seems to me to hear it. </seg>
<seg id="913"> Do you feel it? </seg>
<seg id="914"> Oh... </seg>
<seg id="915"> Now there is no more, but did you hear it before? I think so. </seg>
<seg id="916"> He resonated throughout the building. </seg>
<seg id="917"> Where we are? In Armory, Taylor. "In Armory, Taylor" </seg>
<seg id="918"> It has such a heavy sound. </seg>
<seg id="919"> The Armory. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Nikola Tesla. </seg>
<seg id="921"> He perceived Earth as a conductor ... ... of acoustic resonance. </seg>
<seg id="922"> I have no idea what you are talking about. </seg>
<seg id="923"> Could you explain yourself better? </seg>
<seg id="924"> Actually no. I have an idea, pretend that this coffee is champagne. </seg>
<seg id="925"> And why? </seg>
<seg id="926"> To celebrate life. </seg>
<seg id="927"> How rich, elegant people do. </seg>
<seg id="928"> Classy people. </seg>
<seg id="929"> I prefer Coffee, The Honest Cafe of the Proletarians. </seg>
<seg id="930"> You're so provincial, Bill. Do you know what your problem is? </seg>
<seg id="931"> Which? </seg>
<seg id="932"> You do not have "joie de vivre". </seg>
<seg id="933"> No? </seg>
<seg id="934"> No, and more, this coffee sucks. </seg>
<seg id="935"> You're right, it really sucks. Disgusting. </seg>
<seg id="936"> I propose a toast. </seg>
<seg id="937"> A toast to what? </seg>
<seg id="938"> Holy sky, boh ... in Paris </seg>
<seg id="939"> in the 1920s. Josephine Baker ... The Moulin Rouge ... </seg>
<seg id="940"> What's the matter ... what's up ... pa-pa ... </seg>
<seg id="941"> And even in New York. In the 70s. Towards the end. </seg>
<seg id="942"> Really? All right. </seg>
<seg id="943"> - Cheers. - Cheers. </seg>
<seg id="944"> "Délicieux", right? </seg>
<seg id="945"> Ahh, champagne. The God of the Gods! </seg>
<seg id="946"> Everything here your lunch? A coffee and a cigarette? </seg>
<seg id="947"> It is not very healthy. </seg>
<seg id="948"> We had lunch before. Before? </seg>
<seg id="949"> Now let's break, coffee break. </seg>
<seg id="950"> What a sadness. </seg>
<seg id="951"> And how long does this break? </seg>
<seg id="952"> A dozen minutes is almost over. </seg>
<seg id="953"> Tell me that's not true. </seg>
<seg id="954"> - So what? </seg>
<seg id="955"> I asked you to tell me that it is not true. </seg>
<seg id="956"> Tell you that this is not true? </seg>
<seg id="957"> Do nothing, do nothing, do nothing. Leave it alone. </seg>
<seg id="958"> I, anyway, have to rest. </seg>
<seg id="959"> Wake me up when the pause ends. </seg>
<seg id="960"> You have two short minutes to rest. </seg>
</doc>
<doc docid="deathproof" genre="subtitles" sysid="sys">
<seg id="1"> Wait, wait! </seg>
<seg id="2"> I have to do a pisciata, the biggest pisciata in the world! </seg>
<seg id="3"> - So let's go! - Stay calm! </seg>
<seg id="4"> - Who has the stuff? - No one, if you do not have it. </seg>
<seg id="5"> - I was hoping to bring you. - Yeah, why do not you have the stuff? Holy Christ, Shanna, it's not my fucking job supplying you all the grass when we leave! </seg>
<seg id="6"> Brake, sir! </seg>
<seg id="7"> You get angry a little too fast. I was just teasing you. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But who gets angry ?! Perhaps it would be nice if you did not mind me all the fucking times and if you were surprised by bringing it to me every now and then! </seg>
<seg id="9"> Okay, you look bad in a kids movie. - Finish the whims? - I'm not doing the whims. - Yes, on the other hand! </seg>
<seg id="10"> You're in the car for two seconds and I swear! </seg>
<seg id="11"> I did not say swearing. Yeah, dear, you said, "Holy Christ, Shanna!" </seg>
<seg id="12"> And before finishing the sentence you put a "fuck" to emphasize your irritation. - All right, I buy it when we find it. </seg>
<seg id="13"> One: I'm not the money the problem, but the break of balls to go find the grass, and two: We are not arguing. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Arlene, have you forgotten that it means going around with Jungle Julia? </seg>
<seg id="15"> This is not arguing. </seg>
<seg id="16"> This is Julia who acts as a pesky bitch and I reproach and are indulgent at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="17"> So what we are after all these years. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Billboard! </seg>
<seg id="19"> So, what's the plan, beauty? - Margarita and Mexican food from Guero's. </seg>
<seg id="20"> - Did you call Rafael to tell him we're coming? - SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="21"> - How good are you! - I know! </seg>
<seg id="22"> We hear, tonight will also see Christian Simonson? </seg>
<seg id="23"> You can bet your ass, he comes with Jesse Letterman. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Christian Simonson, the director, is in the city! </seg>
<seg id="25"> - And he has a cake for Julia. "If he had a crush on me, he would call me instead of disappearing for 6 months and would move his ass more often to come here and make a phone call on my birthday. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Billboard! </seg>
<seg id="27"> Yeah, but if you try to put your beautiful legs on it, it's done. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Only when I'm going to sell her home on the hill where I will live, I'll call you to tell you it worked. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Then, Margarita and Mexican food from Guero's, hear Christian and Jesse, tell him later and make sure they come. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Others expect us to reach Texas Chili Parlor. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Fuck! About the others, what did you and Nate do last night? </seg>
<seg id="32"> What do you want to do? We just met, fuck! </seg>
<seg id="33"> If you do not slit the balls a while, when they respect you? </seg>
<seg id="34"> All right, it's clear what you did not do. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Why do not you enlighten us about what you did? </seg>
<seg id="36"> Just nothing special. </seg>
<seg id="37"> We kissed on the couch for 20 minutes. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Clothes, naked or nude? </seg>
<seg id="39"> Clothes! We kissed, we did not do "the fact". </seg>
<seg id="40"> Sorry if I break the balls, but what would be the "fact"? </seg>
<seg id="41"> - "The fact" would be all the rest. - And you call it "the fact"? </seg>
<seg id="42"> - I call it "the fact". - Do you guys like that call it "the fact"? </seg>
<seg id="43"> Surely more than the "no". </seg>
<seg id="44"> Okay, now I want to go back to what you did. </seg>
<seg id="45"> "You and Nate kissed on the couch. - That's right. - At home or at your hotel? - Do you look like a scum? From me! </seg>
<seg id="46"> Did you sit or lie down on the couch? </seg>
<seg id="47"> We started sitting and then lying down. </seg>
<seg id="48"> - Mh! The game is tough! Who was on it? - I'm riding. </seg>
<seg id="49"> - Nothing else? "We kissed some more on the couch, then I said," Now I have to go to bed, so you have to go. " </seg>
<seg id="50"> And he began to cry: "Right now?" </seg>
<seg id="51"> And I: "Yeah, right now, go away." And he: "I make a proposal for you." </seg>
<seg id="52"> And I: "No," and he: "Why do not you, you do not know what I mean." </seg>
<seg id="53"> And I: "I know what you mean and the answer is no." </seg>
<seg id="54"> And he: "How do you know what I mean?" </seg>
<seg id="55"> And I: "You are about to say, 'we can sleep together, we do nothing,' '' just two cuddles, we sleep near, tomorrow we wake up together. ' "No, you go now and tomorrow morning we'll see you." </seg>
<seg id="56"> Frighten by Nate! It's cute! </seg>
<seg id="57"> For me, Jesse Letterman drowned her all night. </seg>
<seg id="58"> - Jesse Letterman? - Remember, you can not tow tonight. </seg>
<seg id="59"> If you go, you can come out afterwards, you can kiss them but do not bring them down because we have to go to Lake LBJ tonight and my dad has been clear on one thing, he said: </seg>
<seg id="60"> "Tonight I will allow you and your dear friends to stay at my home on the lake," not to you and to the twisted boys "who want to fuck my daughter." </seg>
<seg id="61"> - You talk so? - SÃƒÂ¬. - Here! </seg>
<seg id="62"> And there is not even a way to hide it because every time I'm at the lake with my girlfriends and we're in bikini, look at pop falls to see if there's nothing left to it! </seg>
<seg id="63"> - Girls, it's totally harmless and cute like an insect's ear! </seg>
<seg id="64"> But when he knows that there are a bunch of nudes that sneak in his home to the lake, he likes to come and check if there is nothing missing. </seg>
<seg id="65"> And if you foolishly make the thread, just like our giraffe here behind, win a puppy for a lifetime. </seg>
<seg id="66"> I have a whole relationship with Ben and you are jealous because he does not include you. </seg>
<seg id="67"> - Do you call his dad Ben? - Of course I'm not a little girl. </seg>
<seg id="68"> - Boys when they see you? - We meet at the Chili Parlor. </seg>
<seg id="69"> - Maybe they take some grass - not even for fucking. </seg>
<seg id="70"> I do not want to, A, depend on those cackles, n, B, get rid of those cats. If we do not find it, we're stuck with them all the fuck in the evening. </seg>
<seg id="71"> - Let's try with Lanna Frank. - This one is an idea, good. </seg>
<seg id="72"> Look, your last bill before Guero's! </seg>
<seg id="73"> What balls, you got me stew! </seg>
<seg id="74"> What a fucking ball! We had said "every time". - All right. </seg>
<seg id="75"> - Julia, I finish it. - Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="76"> - Hello. - Hello. </seg>
<seg id="77"> - Are you sitting with us? - Second one, they're with friends. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Oh! You must be the infamous Butterfly. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Shhh! Zitta, she still does not know anything! </seg>
<seg id="80"> - Nothing about it? - And when do you tell her? - Then! </seg>
<seg id="81"> - Thing? - Thank you, we'll have to tell you more then. </seg>
<seg id="82"> Bitch! What the fuck's going on? </seg>
<seg id="83"> Today on the radio I said something about you live. </seg>
<seg id="84"> Julia, tell me what fuck you said about me on the radio. </seg>
<seg id="85"> I just said that a friend named Butterfly came to see me for the weekend and we'd be going around Austin tonight and if anyone was in the area we could meet you and I described how you did and said that if someone was watching you in the city, then if you did one thing, you would have done one thing. </seg>
<seg id="86"> Julia, am I serious, what did you say and what did you say I would do? </seg>
<seg id="87"> Let's just say so: I could say what I said, but it would be boring, or Marcy here, being an amazing actress, could play it for us, which would give you a more accurate idea of ​​what we have in store for you tonight . </seg>
<seg id="88"> - Okay, tell me how you like. - Do we play Marcy? - Sure! </seg>
<seg id="89"> - Give Marcy your glass. - Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="90"> So you are in a bar or in a bar and Marcy is a cute, very sexy, very sexy guy, or maybe a boy to die for, but not funny. </seg>
<seg id="91"> - Anyway, it's one you picked up. - Clear. - Go, Marcy, it's up to you. </seg>
<seg id="92"> EhilÃƒÂ ... </seg>
<seg id="93"> How are you? </seg>
<seg id="94"> Sorry, but are not you what's called Butterfly, by chance? </seg>
<seg id="95"> - Yeah, right. And if you tell me your name, let's down. - Barry. </seg>
<seg id="96"> - Very pleased, Barry. - Get me excited! Shhh! </seg>
<seg id="97"> Listen, and ... Butterfly is your real name? </seg>
<seg id="98"> Yeah, sure. And how do you know my name, Barry? </seg>
<seg id="99"> I heard Jungle Julia broadcast this morning. </seg>
<seg id="100"> - Are you listening to him? Really! - Yeah, I hear it every morning. </seg>
<seg id="101"> - Every morning, but come on! - Yeah, Julia is the most pompous woman in the city. </seg>
<seg id="102"> - Do not you think your ass is a little bigger in your opinion? - No, shit. </seg>
<seg id="103"> My ass looks like me a lot. </seg>
<seg id="104"> What you find is a nice black ass. </seg>
<seg id="105"> It's what she always says, but the truth that she does not have a nice black ass at all, she only has two huge lashes. - What the fuck are you talking about ?! </seg>
<seg id="106"> - What do I say? I'm going to go, darling. - Okay, let's go: </seg>
<seg id="107"> For your information, shit shit, lots of blacks, and lots of white bastards if I've spared a world to worship my ass. </seg>
<seg id="108"> I still have the marks of their teeth on my back. </seg>
<seg id="109"> - If you do not offer me a drink, did I give up my glass? - Well, okay, okay. </seg>
<seg id="110"> "Then, Butterfly, do we have a drink?" - With extreme pleasure. - What are we doing? - What about a Margarita? </seg>
<seg id="111"> Eccotelo. </seg>
<seg id="112"> After they have offered you to drink and raise your glass for a toast, you have to look right in your eyes and repeat this poem: "The forest is magnificent, deep in dusk" and I promise to keep "" miles away to go before sleeping ". </seg>
<seg id="113"> Did you hear, Butterfly? </seg>
<seg id="114"> "Miles to go before sleeping". </seg>
<seg id="115"> So if they tell you this, you have to do a lap dance. - That?! </seg>
<seg id="116"> If they call you Butterfly, they offer you drink and say poetry, you do a lap dance! - Fanculo! I do nothing! You can do it or not, but if you do not, here in Austin you think you're a cacassotto, and I do not think you want someone to think about it. </seg>
<seg id="117"> I do not just lap dance because you said that. </seg>
<seg id="118"> - Come on, it's funny! - It's funny if these shit touches me! </seg>
<seg id="119"> Look, you do not have to do it to anyone, if you do not. </seg>
<seg id="120"> I said you would have done it to the first one who says poetry, so if somebody comes to you to make a fig, tell him that you've done it before in another place. </seg>
<seg id="121"> No harm, no problem, and we also remedies for free drinking. But maybe tonight, a little later, when you have drunk a bit, you feel relaxed, safe between your friends ... If a cute, very sexy, sexy, spicy guy dies, but not funny look and tell you poetry, maybe you did it before or maybe you did not. </seg>
<seg id="122"> Lanna Frank, where are you? - Fuck this, that's a good question! </seg>
<seg id="123"> Lanna Frank! Where are you? </seg>
<seg id="124"> Come here, we're waiting for you. </seg>
<seg id="125"> Fuck! Wait. </seg>
<seg id="126"> Where are you? </seg>
<seg id="127"> All right, come on, we're waiting for you. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Forget it, we do not come to you. Come on, as you said. </seg>
<seg id="129"> - How's the story, Shauna and the girls at the lake on the weekend? - Shauna? </seg>
<seg id="130"> Oh! Shit, I ... </seg>
<seg id="131"> No! There is only one thing that girls from all over the world who call themselves Shanna have in common with each other: We share the name Shauna and hate the people who call us so. </seg>
<seg id="132"> Do not forget, I'm Shanna Banana, not Shauna Banona. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Yeah, but before my crap my cock was climbing? </seg>
<seg id="134"> Yeah, not really up there, but ... </seg>
<seg id="135"> - Guys, Warren sends you a shot. You know the rules of the house: </seg>
<seg id="136"> If he sends the shot, you need to get them. - Why? - Hey, that's the rules, baby. Warren says, we do. </seg>
<seg id="137"> How I love this philosophy: Warren says, we do. </seg>
<seg id="138"> - Then, guys, let's do it! - SÃƒÂ¬. - What's the matter? </seg>
<seg id="139"> Zitta, first drinks, then questions. Get the horses off! </seg>
<seg id="140"> Ah! </seg>
<seg id="141"> Ah! </seg>
<seg id="142"> Is it a fantastic thing or is not it a fantastic thing? </seg>
<seg id="143"> But what the fucking stuff is? </seg>
<seg id="144"> Chartreuse, the only liqueur so good that has given its name to a color. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Who is ready for dos Chartreuse? </seg>
<seg id="146"> Too much. I'm going out to get a cigarette. </seg>
<seg id="147"> Do not get too close to the lighter, huh? </seg>
<seg id="148"> - Drink that we bring you? - Shanna Banana? </seg>
<seg id="149"> Another Long lsland ice tea giant. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Bombay Sapphire tonic, no ice. Strong, huh? But good kids! </seg>
<seg id="151"> Plate, one of the parking lights is off. Why do not you light it up? </seg>
<seg id="152"> - Ah! - Oh! - Jesus Christ! </seg>
<seg id="153"> I'm fucking scared, you're a big dick! </seg>
<seg id="154"> I swear, Arlene, I did not want to scare you. </seg>
<seg id="155"> - I only had a great luck. - What the fuck! - Let's go inside. - Wait. - Why? - Why do not we give a nice kiss? Where, here? Are you stupid? Not even at the bar, in front of the entrance? </seg>
<seg id="156"> - No, in my car. - LÃ¤ out? </seg>
<seg id="157"> - Rain that seems to be in Vietnam. - In the car it does not rain. </seg>
<seg id="158"> Look, I do not get you wet. I can assure you. </seg>
<seg id="159"> It is the first time I feel a man boast of this. </seg>
<seg id="160"> Ah, ah, ah! You know what I meant. </seg>
<seg id="161"> Since you go to Lake LBJ and that we can not come, let us give a kiss! - Yeah, but stop crying. </seg>
<seg id="162"> You make me even more crap. </seg>
<seg id="163"> Okay, but I do not want him to know all the damn bar, so we go in the car and kiss for exactly 6 minutes, are you? </seg>
<seg id="164"> - Sure. - No, no, are you or not? </seg>
<seg id="165"> If you start to rush when I leave after 6 minutes, it's better to go back to the bar right away. - I'm in. Do not fry. </seg>
<seg id="166"> - And do not pray. - And do not pray. When you say "finished" it's over. </seg>
<seg id="167"> Looks like I remember it. Let's go. </seg>
<seg id="168"> You have two tasks: Kiss well and do not wet my hair. </seg>
<seg id="169"> You do not have to try to take it away before Christian Simonson arrives. </seg>
<seg id="170"> You have to take her away before Christian Simonson arrives! </seg>
<seg id="171"> That changes? They are from Shanna's father and the kids are absolutely forbidden. </seg>
<seg id="172"> Then, having brought the girls to drink, in quick succession but without pointing to us, we order two more rounds of shot. - Do you think they're scolding you? </seg>
<seg id="173"> We will be very convincing. And it is time to raise the volume. We play heavy, we go to JÃƒÂ © germeister. </seg>
<seg id="174"> What the fuck are you saying? Women do not drink JÃƒÂ¤ germeister. </seg>
<seg id="175"> As long as a male pays for a drink, a whore will drink anything. </seg>
<seg id="176"> Let's get off at least a lap of JÃƒÂ¤ germeister in those gorges. </seg>
<seg id="177"> And then let's see if they do another. </seg>
<seg id="178"> You never know, they might say, "Who cares?" </seg>
<seg id="179"> And then "no kids at the lake home" becomes "two guys at the lake home". - That's right. </seg>
<seg id="180"> You will see that Shanna will suck the banana and get a Buttery Nipple. </seg>
<seg id="181"> - Does Julia like sweet liquor like? - Key Lime Pie. What a fucking shit! No one resists a sweet liqueur. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Fuck! Look at that, it looks BJ. What if he also brought the monkey. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Jesus Christ! </seg>
<seg id="184"> That guy got scared by falling from the time machine. </seg>
<seg id="185"> Warren, do you give me a chicken soup for Stroker Ace, please? </seg>
<seg id="186"> Where were you two? - I got something in the car. Nate accompanied me with her umbrella and I did not get wet. </seg>
<seg id="187"> - Good for you, Nate! - You see that pretty girl alone at the counter? </seg>
<seg id="188"> - Who, the poor hippie? - Meow! It's not a hippie. </seg>
<seg id="189"> It has the hippie air. </seg>
<seg id="190"> You're a treasure, Timmy. Well, you know what happened to her? </seg>
<seg id="191"> No, but I know it's a dry bun with her dyed hair. </seg>
<seg id="192"> Did you want to tell her story? What happened to her? </seg>
<seg id="193"> Warren? Do I recommend someone here to make a pass? </seg>
<seg id="194"> My lady, my carriage is her. What are you doing, ears? </seg>
<seg id="195"> There is "eavesdropping" and "impossible to hear". I think I belong to the second category. </seg>
<seg id="196"> If I understand, Icy Hot, do you offer me a tear? </seg>
<seg id="197"> I'm offering you a tear, if when I leave, you're ready too. </seg>
<seg id="198"> - And when do you think you're going away? - I'm not really thinking about it. </seg>
<seg id="199"> But as soon as I do, you'll be the first to know. </seg>
<seg id="200"> And will you be able to drive afterwards? </seg>
<seg id="201"> I know the appearances deceive, but I really are timid. </seg>
<seg id="202"> I did not drink tonic water and lime all night, and now I'm preparing for my big cocktail. </seg>
<seg id="203"> - That would? - Virgin Pina Colada. </seg>
<seg id="204"> Okay, why does a person who does not drink alcohol spend hours in a bar drinking almost water? </seg>
<seg id="205"> A bar offers a mountain of things beyond the alcohol. </seg>
<seg id="206"> Mh! You say? Eg? </seg>
<seg id="207"> Women. A plate of Nacho Grande. The company of several fascinating individuals like Warren, for example. I love it. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Alcohol is just the lubricant for the encounters that a bar can offer. </seg>
<seg id="209"> - What, cowboy philosophy? - I'm not a cowboy, Pam. </seg>
<seg id="210"> I'm a stuntman. But it is a very, very easy mistake to make. </seg>
<seg id="211"> How do you know my name? </seg>
<seg id="212"> When you talked to Warren, I could not hear it. </seg>
<seg id="213"> There may be. And how do you call me, Icy? </seg>
<seg id="214"> - Stuntman Mike. - Stuntman Mike is your name? </seg>
<seg id="215"> Ask him who you want. </seg>
<seg id="216"> - Warren, who is this here? - Stuntman Mike! </seg>
<seg id="217"> - Ah! And who the fuck is Stuntman Mike? - A stuntman. </seg>
<seg id="218"> We're there, Pam. It's the moment of my big cocktail. </seg>
<seg id="219"> Well, Stuntman Mike, since I have an open account here, can I offer you Pina Colada non-alcoholic? </seg>
<seg id="220"> "No doubt, Pam, very pleased. - Warren? </seg>
<seg id="221"> A Virgin Pina Colada for my friend stuntman </seg>
<seg id="222"> and for me another Cadillac Cabo Wabo Margarita. </seg>
<seg id="223"> Cabo Wabo, Virgin. </seg>
<seg id="224"> That table seems to have sucked all your attention. - That girl's the billboard out here? - SÃƒÂ¬. There is nothing to say, it's a beautiful girl. </seg>
<seg id="225"> We have jin, tequila, whiskey ... </seg>
<seg id="226"> - And what hair! - Embalmed, all balm. </seg>
<seg id="227"> - Do I have some jealousy or badness? - It's wrong. </seg>
<seg id="228"> If you want to get involved with Jungle Julia, there's a very simple way, you know? - Seriously? - Ah. ah. </seg>
<seg id="229"> - And what would that be? - To be famous. </seg>
<seg id="230"> Even if you do not look for it, they'll find you. </seg>
<seg id="231"> And it is better that you do not know what he did for that billboard. </seg>
<seg id="232"> To yours, sucker. 'Fuck! </seg>
<seg id="233"> What will I ever do to you? </seg>
<seg id="234"> We went to school together, from kindergarten to high school. </seg>
<seg id="235"> That's what he did to me. </seg>
<seg id="236"> It was high as well as 12 years old! It was a giant, a monster! </seg>
<seg id="237"> Half of the boys still broke today, at school kicking them and terrorizing them. </seg>
<seg id="238"> I see. Did she even give you and rub the chocolate milk? </seg>
<seg id="239"> That Godzilla bitches? I'll kick a couple of times. </seg>
<seg id="240"> I am a girl, not a nice nerone, but not to give in to Julia Lucai, I would have been killed. </seg>
<seg id="241"> Hello! You look like a famous one. </seg>
<seg id="242"> - Do you look like that? - No, no, seriously. </seg>
<seg id="243"> - Do a little bit, what are you doing? - Seriously? </seg>
<seg id="244"> I put my ass on to take off my record label. </seg>
<seg id="245"> But why that girl wanted my picture, it's because I'm a DJ zone. </seg>
<seg id="246"> Wait a moment. </seg>
<seg id="247"> - There's a billboard in front of Big Kahuna Burger, right? - SÃƒÂ¬. There is one here too, Zatoichi. GiÃƒÂ! </seg>
<seg id="248"> - Jungle Julia Lucai. - Stuntman Mike McKay. - Good! </seg>
<seg id="249"> Pleased to meet you, Stuntman Mike. </seg>
<seg id="250"> Now, sorry, but I and my friends are still doing this. Want a shot? </seg>
<seg id="251"> Thanks, Julia. As if I had accepted, but no, thank you. </seg>
<seg id="252"> - As you want. - You know that... </seg>
<seg id="253"> Porca troia! </seg>
<seg id="254"> Sorry, nothing. </seg>
<seg id="255"> But what the hell is that? </seg>
<seg id="256"> - And that's what I did! </seg>
<seg id="257"> What a nice guarantor you have! </seg>
<seg id="258"> I asked him what movies you did and he said he did not know a fuck. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Technically I do not know if he really did anything. </seg>
<seg id="260"> He once made me see a "On Arizona's borders", there was one who fell from horseback, saying he was him. </seg>
<seg id="261"> Do you know the "Virginian" show? </seg>
<seg id="262"> - SÃƒÂ¬. "There was another actor on that show, Gary Clarke, and I looked a little like him. </seg>
<seg id="263"> Obviously before I cut myself while I was shaving. </seg>
<seg id="264"> For me it's sexy! </seg>
<seg id="265"> Do you know you're so sweet that you make sugar look like salt? </seg>
<seg id="266"> Anyway, I did "The Virgin" as a counterpart to Gary Clarke. </seg>
<seg id="267"> And when they made the second set, Lee Majors came and I also made his own stand-up. </seg>
<seg id="268"> From there, I specialize in car accidents. </seg>
<seg id="269"> Yeah, I did almost all the third series of "Vegas". </seg>
<seg id="270"> I was the contingent of Robert Urich. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Then Bob made another series, "Gavilan", and he also brought me to that, so far, well ... </seg>
<seg id="272"> After that... </seg>
<seg id="273"> At least one of these series I just named, you know that? </seg>
<seg id="274"> - Not even one. - I'm sorry. - No. </seg>
<seg id="275"> Wait, explain a little. How is one becoming a stuntman, Stuntman Mike? </seg>
<seg id="276"> In Hollywood all those who are so stupid to throw themselves down the stairs, find one who pays them to do so. </seg>
<seg id="277"> But I did not go around like everyone else doing stunts. - CioÃ¨? - My brother helped me. - Who is your brother? - Stuntman Bob. </seg>
<seg id="278"> - I'm ready to play. - Go, get it back. </seg>
<seg id="279"> - We have a few laps of advantage. - Let the party begin! - SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="280"> Anyway I'm sorry. Do you want to forgive me? </seg>
<seg id="281"> But you'll have to be pretty with me for as long as I'm in town. </seg>
<seg id="282"> - Promised. Ready to go to the lake? - Mh-mh. </seg>
<seg id="283"> - Want to bring your friend? - You said only women. If you do, Shanna will not have any problems. What do you want to do? </seg>
<seg id="284"> - Even men or women alone? - Only women. - Good idea. </seg>
<seg id="285"> Lord ... </seg>
<seg id="286"> - Thank you. - Health, Butterfly. </seg>
<seg id="287"> "The forest is magnificent, deep in dusk". "And I've promised to keep miles and miles before going to sleep." </seg>
<seg id="288"> Did you hear me, Butterfly? </seg>
<seg id="289"> "Miles to go before sleeping". </seg>
<seg id="290"> - I'm sorry, Stuntman Burt. - Mike. </seg>
<seg id="291"> - Mike. The dances are over. - ÃƒÃ † la veritÃƒÂ? </seg>
<seg id="292"> So, I missed my chance. </seg>
<seg id="293"> Do I scare you? </seg>
<seg id="294"> For the scar? </seg>
<seg id="295"> - For the car. - Yeah, I know, sorry. </seg>
<seg id="296"> It's the mother's car. </seg>
<seg id="297"> - What did you do, are you crazy? - No! But that's what I like about Austin, which is so damn small. </seg>
<seg id="298"> - Have you seen him yet? - I saw him out of Guero's. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Yeah, I also saw you out of Guero's. </seg>
<seg id="300"> You saw my car and I got your legs. </seg>
<seg id="301"> I'm not kidding you, but I do not want to eat you for that. </seg>
<seg id="302"> - Do you think you really believe it? - I'm not following you, Butterfly. </seg>
<seg id="303"> I've been lucky. </seg>
<seg id="304"> Then? What do you do with our lap dance? </seg>
<seg id="305"> I'm sorry, the offer was saying "once only", and she has already made it out of Anthony's. </seg>
<seg id="306"> - It's not true. - What do you know about it? </seg>
<seg id="307"> I'm good at certain things. And you have the air a little touch. </seg>
<seg id="308"> - What does "touch" mean? - Sore throat. </seg>
<seg id="309"> - Why should I be hurt? "Because you were expecting people to torment you all night, but from your gaze I would say that nobody has tormented you. And this hurt your feelings a bit. Few things are as fascinating as the ego wounded by a beautiful angel. </seg>
<seg id="310"> Then? What do you do with our lap dance? </seg>
<seg id="311"> You will have to book for the next time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> But since it's part of a couple of days, I do not think we'll be there next time. </seg>
<seg id="313"> But he does not do anything. </seg>
<seg id="314"> I can see if my presence embarrasses you. </seg>
<seg id="315"> You are, however, a pretty girl and I like it. </seg>
<seg id="316"> I need to tell you something, though. </seg>
<seg id="317"> Do you know what people say? </seg>
<seg id="318"> "You are filed, I've got you now," or "I've got you in the archives now." </seg>
<seg id="319"> Well, let me have a phone book here. And all those I know are in this section. </seg>
<seg id="320"> And now I've met you and you also end up in the phone book. </seg>
<seg id="321"> Yeah, but I'm afraid I'll have to put you under the word "cacasotto". </seg>
<seg id="322"> What if I do it? </seg>
<seg id="323"> Then I could not put you under the word "cacasotto", what do you say? </seg>
<seg id="324"> - How did you say you called? - Stuntman Mike. </seg>
<seg id="325"> Well, Mike Stuntman, I'm Butterfly and my friend Jungle Julia says the jukebox is very much stocked. </seg>
<seg id="326"> - Yeah, he's right. - Eh, yes. </seg>
<seg id="327"> Why do not you go prepare for your lap dance? </seg>
<seg id="328"> I said, "A cute, very sexy, sexy guy," "lousy, but not funny, which, let's say, you picked up." Then you did not understand anything. </seg>
<seg id="329"> Tonight is fucking old Mike. </seg>
<seg id="330"> "With the years he has, he might be my father. - I still feel, darling. </seg>
<seg id="331"> Hello. Bye Bye. </seg>
<seg id="332"> - Fuck, she's really scared! - Yeah, I wanted something awesome. </seg>
<seg id="333"> Fear tends to impress. </seg>
<seg id="334"> - And is it safe? - No, it's more than safe. It's a death proof. </seg>
<seg id="335"> How do you make a dead-end machine? Well, it's the job of a stuntman. Do you see those movies where the machines make accidents that nobody could get out of? </seg>
<seg id="336"> - SÃƒÂ¬. - And how do you realize them? </seg>
<seg id="337"> At the PC? </seg>
<seg id="338"> Yes, sadly, Pam, today most of the time is as you say. </seg>
<seg id="339"> But at the time or nothing, at the time of "Zero Point", "Zozza Mary, crazy Gary", of "Violence on the Highway", real cars fluttered against real machines, with real idiots driving them. </seg>
<seg id="340"> At that time, you gave the stunt the car you wanted to smash, they reinforced that bastard everywhere and voilÃƒÂ¤, they drove out a beautiful dead-end machine. </seg>
<seg id="341"> It does not look like shit, I did not know there were dead-end machines. </seg>
<seg id="342"> I can crumble it into a brick wall going 200 kilometers an hour, just to see that it does. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Fuck, but here the passenger puts it in box, why? </seg>
<seg id="344"> Because it's a movie car. Sometimes when an accident occurs, the filmmaker puts us the camera to film the incident from the inside. </seg>
<seg id="345"> And here's the room, it's called "crash box". Here it is. </seg>
<seg id="346"> Have a seat. </seg>
<seg id="347"> When you asked me to accompany you, you did not say you did not have the place to go by car. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Truly, I did not ask you to accompany you. You asked me for a walk and I said yes. Look at the positive side: I can not try putting one hand on my knee. Yeah, it's the only positive side. </seg>
<seg id="349"> I knew it. </seg>
<seg id="350"> "Then, Pam, where do you go, left or right?" - Right. - It's a pity. - Why? </seg>
<seg id="351"> Because there was 50% of the possibilities to go left as right. </seg>
<seg id="352"> We, on the other hand, will go both to the left. You could have chosen to go to the left and it would take a while to start scaring. </seg>
<seg id="353"> But since you're on the other side, I'm afraid you'll have to start afraid immediately. </seg>
<seg id="354"> Fuck you ?! </seg>
<seg id="355"> Stronzo succulent, bastard! Get me out of here! </seg>
<seg id="356"> I break your car! Stop this fucking machine! </seg>
<seg id="357"> Okay ... Look ... I understand. </seg>
<seg id="358"> It's all a joke. It's too funny. </seg>
<seg id="359"> But please, let me get down. I hurt myself. I do not tell anyone, I swear to you. I know it's a joke. </seg>
<seg id="360"> Please, I promise I will not tell anyone. </seg>
<seg id="361"> - Let me down, please. - Hey, Pam! </seg>
<seg id="362"> Do you remember when I said the car was deadly? </seg>
<seg id="363"> It was not a lie. </seg>
<seg id="364"> This machine is 100% dead-end. </seg>
<seg id="365"> But to enjoy this advantage, darling, you should be sitting exactly where I am. </seg>
<seg id="366"> And now it's the turn of my other friendly friends. </seg>
<seg id="367"> No, no, no, I'm Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich. </seg>
<seg id="368"> You got it? Thanks, honey. You put it right now, right? </seg>
<seg id="369"> Great. </seg>
<seg id="370"> Wow! </seg>
<seg id="371"> Bye Bye. </seg>
<seg id="372"> - What do you want to hear? - Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick and Tich. </seg>
<seg id="373"> - Who? - Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick and Tich. </seg>
<seg id="374"> - And who the fuck are they? - For your information, Pete Townshend at some point was about to leave the Who and if he did, he would end up in this group, so they would become Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick, Tich, and Pete. It was better if he went there. Yeah, he got us! More, make me feel stronger! </seg>
<seg id="375"> Did not see anything? </seg>
<seg id="376"> No, I do not remember. </seg>
<seg id="377"> Dr. Davis in the clinic. </seg>
<seg id="378"> Tell me, what is the patient's prognosis, Dr. Block? </seg>
<seg id="379"> - I do not think they are his business. - Come on, sister, just say enough. </seg>
<seg id="380"> How bad is it? </seg>
<seg id="381"> That type is beautifully ruined: Broken nose, broken teeth, broken clavicle, and the left index is also rubbed. - Is it still alive? </seg>
<seg id="382"> He was lucky. </seg>
<seg id="383"> - Need anything else? - No, it's more than enough. Thank you, Dr. Block. </seg>
<seg id="384"> Son of a bitch! </seg>
<seg id="385"> - So, daddy, what do you think? - You know, son number one, what I think is a damned macabre that I can say aloud. </seg>
<seg id="386"> - Try it anyway, pa. - We have a case of vehicle murder. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Our old man killed those pretty girls. </seg>
<seg id="388"> He used a car and not a hatch, but they were dead too. </seg>
<seg id="389"> - What are you going to do, huh? - They will not do anything, damn it! </seg>
<seg id="390"> The prosecutor says there is no crime. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Each of those poor girls was swimming in the alcohol, fluctuating in the grass, and the old Hooper of lÃƒÂ, instead, is cleaned like a lamb. </seg>
<seg id="392"> But you are sure? Do you really think he killed those girls? </seg>
<seg id="393"> I can not prove it. But since thinking does not cost anything, I can think so, so I think so. </seg>
<seg id="394"> Yeah, but he's too bad. </seg>
<seg id="395"> Yeah, it's bad, but damn it, those pretty girls seemed to chew and then spit out a fucking giant. </seg>
<seg id="396"> - How come no one survived? - Fuck! </seg>
<seg id="397"> Two tons of metal, flesh and bone, and old dear Newton. How did the fuck survive? </seg>
<seg id="398"> PerchÃƒÂ ©? </seg>
<seg id="399"> See, I can assume it's a sex thing. </seg>
<seg id="400"> There can not be anything else. </seg>
<seg id="401"> Impact at high speed, twisted plates, broken glasses, four souls taken at the same instant. </seg>
<seg id="402"> Perhaps just so, the degenerate man can shoot his gelatinous stuff. </seg>
<seg id="403"> We can only accuse that carburetor of a car driver with that box of death, that is, the old dear public corruption. </seg>
<seg id="404"> But a damned bartender has come over who will testify that Stuntman Mike did not drink all evening and that his passenger had been relieved by his boyfriend in a damn rain and asked her for a walk. </seg>
<seg id="405"> On paper, he looks like he wants to give her a hand. </seg>
<seg id="406"> - So, so he'll see the jury. - So what do you do, huh? </seg>
<seg id="407"> I could only work on the case in the free hours. </seg>
<seg id="408"> Look for evidence, demonstrate theory, whatever it is, and become the torment of that sullen son of a bitch. </seg>
<seg id="409"> Wherever he goes, I go. Or I could commit the same amount of time and energy to follow the NASCAR circuit, son. Yeah, I'd love a lot. </seg>
<seg id="410"> And I would be much happier if I chose the second. </seg>
<seg id="411"> And just because I can not punish that Frankenstein for what he did, I tell you, as the Lord told John, that if he were to do it again, I'm sure he will not be here in Texas. </seg>
<seg id="412"> - Were you on the same plane? - I'm 4th and he's 7th. </seg>
<seg id="413"> - Who in the room? - In my. </seg>
<seg id="414"> - Then what happened? - We kissed him in the lobby for 10 minutes and then I sent him to his room. - And how does this rock kiss this Rock? You do not know what a good one it is! It has soft lips, all to bite. </seg>
<seg id="415"> - I love the soft lips! - Then it's really big, he turned me and he put me back and with his huge mannea touched my throat, he took my head back, he bent over me and kissed me from behind. </seg>
<seg id="416"> - Fuck, it looks exciting! - Mh, it was exciting. </seg>
<seg id="417"> And then nothing else? Did you send it away? </seg>
<seg id="418"> - How did he get it? - But why are we stopping here? </seg>
<seg id="419"> If I have to drive to take Zoe at the airport, I need a coffee bean! "Since you go to the bar, do you still get vodka and some sugar-free Red Bulls?" </seg>
<seg id="420"> - You did not realize you were awake. - It's so, I sleep. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Remember: Vodka, a few Red Bulls without sugar and the Red Apple Tans. </seg>
<seg id="422"> - What a fuck! Mica I stopped to make you the expense! </seg>
<seg id="423"> - Do you know how to get to the airport? - Sure. </seg>
<seg id="424"> Then put yourself in the wheel, because after you drive. </seg>
<seg id="425"> What a bastard! </seg>
<seg id="426"> They do not have Red Bull without sugar. Only normal or G.O. juice unsweetened. </seg>
<seg id="427"> - Cazzo, G.O. - Mr.O! </seg>
<seg id="428"> Where the fuck are the keys? Ah, here it is. </seg>
<seg id="429"> That bastards! I did not wanna wake you. </seg>
<seg id="430"> You have nothing to do with it. That jerk hit my foot as it passed. </seg>
<seg id="431"> I do not know, it made me shiver. </seg>
<seg id="432"> Prick. </seg>
<seg id="433"> Sure. </seg>
<seg id="434"> Since I'm awake, I take some money at the ATM and make a nice cigarette. </seg>
<seg id="435"> - Fuck you? - You saw that ... - What? Nothing honey. </seg>
<seg id="436"> - Ready? - It's me! - Are you missing out? </seg>
<seg id="437"> It's better to take your butt off Kim's car. </seg>
<seg id="438"> - She too sat down before that. - His butts are not yours. </seg>
<seg id="439"> All right. </seg>
<seg id="440"> I should be on the number this month of Allure. </seg>
<seg id="441"> - Do you have Allure? - The magazines near the window. </seg>
<seg id="442"> Here you are! </seg>
<seg id="443"> You're a real bastard. </seg>
<seg id="444"> Arrive right away. </seg>
<seg id="445"> And they are 16 and 15 of the rest. Thank you and goodbye. </seg>
<seg id="446"> I have other fashion magazines for sale in the back. </seg>
<seg id="447"> No, I'm not interested. That's enough. </seg>
<seg id="448"> - Just for information. - Thanks anyway. - Good day. </seg>
<seg id="449"> Look behind that I also have Italian Vogue. </seg>
<seg id="450"> Of this month? </seg>
<seg id="451"> This is what I have to tell. </seg>
<seg id="452"> The Circle A boy has the number of this month's Italian Vogue. </seg>
<seg id="453"> - I can not believe! - Strange but true. </seg>
<seg id="454"> How could they have it? </seg>
<seg id="455"> In fact they do not have it. Sell ​​his personal copy. </seg>
<seg id="456"> - It's worth $ 27. - $ 27? </seg>
<seg id="457"> What are your problems? It's like our shit shit. </seg>
<seg id="458"> I found a number of Italian Vogue in Lebanon, Tennesse, and he does not ask Krugerrand to pay for it. I take it and divide it into three parts. </seg>
<seg id="459"> - I, you and Kim? - No, Kim does not give a fuck to Italian Vogue. </seg>
<seg id="460"> But Brandy will participate. And if not you, Tyson, the assistant. </seg>
<seg id="461"> Okay, but if someone rips one of the pages I want, I do the color photocopies, and not in any copier, take her to the scenery department and the photocopies for good. </seg>
<seg id="462"> I do the trick to Lindsey Lohan and she will miss for three days. For now there are no scenes with stunts, so Kim is free, and Lee is available for the next four days. </seg>
<seg id="463"> - And how did they go? - Great big. </seg>
<seg id="464"> We have a lot of fun. The director, Cecil Evans, is very sympathetic. </seg>
<seg id="465"> - The movie is really cool and there are parties every night. - Sure. </seg>
<seg id="466"> It is true, they will surely hunt down the job after this. </seg>
<seg id="467"> Then, ladies, we talk about adventures. Who does stuff? </seg>
<seg id="468"> - I'll talk about Lee and Tool. - Eh? - Oh, tool! </seg>
<seg id="469"> - The name promises good. - It's a gunner! </seg>
<seg id="470"> - It's really a pervert. - It's getting more and more interesting. </seg>
<seg id="471"> What is its perversion? </seg>
<seg id="472"> Look at me as I do the pipÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="473"> Lee goes to the cup and Tool looks at her pissing. </seg>
<seg id="474"> Tiky. Tiky. Tiky. You! </seg>
<seg id="475"> Yeah, but now no more. Now she's doing it with The Rock. </seg>
<seg id="476"> Are you fuckin 'The Rock ?! Not really The Rock, an electrician named Bruce. </seg>
<seg id="477"> Kim calls it The Rock because it looks like The Rock and now we all call it The Rock. - It's a pseudo-star crew. </seg>
<seg id="478"> There is one equal to Nicolas Cage and one that resembles Pee-Wee Herman. </seg>
<seg id="479"> Kim, the cockpit department how are you? </seg>
<seg id="480"> No cocks this round. Now I have a companion. </seg>
<seg id="481"> - How long have you got this companion? Almost 3 months. </seg>
<seg id="482"> - To whom did you frighten him? - I did not rub it! - Kim! - Well? Everyone knows they had a girlfriend. </seg>
<seg id="483"> Nothing new, all Kim's boys are the boys of another. </seg>
<seg id="484"> Girls, I did not rub it. And I have never frustrated anyone, they are they disappearing! </seg>
<seg id="485"> And what about your hands, Abernathy? </seg>
<seg id="486"> Abbie has the big Kahuna in her hands. </seg>
<seg id="487"> - I had a cook for Cecil on the set. - Cotta on the set? But please! On the set you were like his wife. </seg>
<seg id="488"> "I had" and "were" the keywords. </seg>
<seg id="489"> You are still both taken, do not bury. </seg>
<seg id="490"> If she is so in love with me, why does she shoot Daryl Hannah's counterpart? </seg>
<seg id="491"> Yeah, men are bitches. Is not that fun? </seg>
<seg id="492"> - ÃƒÃ † cosÃƒÂ¬ fun! - Do not do what's wrong with us. - You're just fucking your ass. - It's just a fucking counterpart. </seg>
<seg id="493"> Beautiful, you have to overcome this shit. It was 2 weeks ago. </seg>
<seg id="494"> Sure, if you put it this way ... </seg>
<seg id="495"> I did not tell you the best part: If it's fucked up at my birthday. </seg>
<seg id="496"> - Then this changes things. - Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="497"> Did you know it was your party? The directors are always so busy. </seg>
<seg id="498"> He ate a slice of my birthday cake and brought me a present. Yeah, I'd say he knew that. - Cabbage! What gift did you do? </seg>
<seg id="499"> He made me a cassette. </seg>
<seg id="500"> - Did you make a cassette? - SÃƒÂ¬. - Ah! </seg>
<seg id="501"> - You did not burn a CD, did you make a cassette? - SÃƒÂ¬. - What a romantic thing! - I know what you're saying, so it's useless to find out. - For me it's a great demonstration of love. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Feel it, I know you like it. Yeah, it's cool. But she's fucked another woman on my birthday. </seg>
<seg id="503"> How do you not stay on my side? </seg>
<seg id="504"> - That's right, it looks like a bad thing. - It's a shit! </seg>
<seg id="505"> But below is there any other reason? </seg>
<seg id="506"> - You two fucked? - Of course not. </seg>
<seg id="507"> - Sorry, you call Abernathy? - Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="508"> The answer to your question is: No, of course not. </seg>
<seg id="509"> What does "No, of course not" mean? </seg>
<seg id="510"> The reason why Cecil does not have a fixed girl for six years is because the girls are fucked. And if you are Cecil, do not become one of her girls. </seg>
<seg id="511"> I do not say why I want to be her girlfriend, but if I wanted to be and I was fucked up, now I would not be her girlfriend, I would be one of her stories. </seg>
<seg id="512"> And I'm getting a bit old for shit. </seg>
<seg id="513"> - You did not do anything at all? - Of course he does. </seg>
<seg id="514"> I made a foot massage and when we went to the movie, I let him hold his hand on his knees. </seg>
<seg id="515"> Bella, you behave like a twelve-year-old, he's acting like a man. Let it smell at least! </seg>
<seg id="516"> - Let's say things like they are: You do not aim for it. - No. - Do not blow it. - No. - You do not even hear him. - No. But the counterpart of Daryl Hannah does. Can we close the discussion on my sexual life? </seg>
<seg id="517"> Truly the discussion was about Cecil's sex life, your treasure is nonexistent. </seg>
<seg id="518"> I cry to both of you and your humor. </seg>
<seg id="519"> Before claiming a big dick, darling, you have to deserve it, the dick. You can start by making a nice saw in his trailer bag Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="520"> - They will not! - I know you will not do it, but you know who will do it? </seg>
<seg id="521"> The whore who will eventually live with him in his huge villa. </seg>
<seg id="522"> Feel, I'm not entirely in agreement with Kim, but it's also true that if you've kept it like you say with Cecil and suddenly you start to bite, you blow your brain! </seg>
<seg id="523"> Zoe, Kim and I were in the Philippines at a rave outdoors. </seg>
<seg id="524"> - What movie? - "Three Heads in Head # 3". </seg>
<seg id="525"> To put it all, we were all three lost. - SÃƒÂ¬! </seg>
<seg id="526"> - Go. - Let's go. </seg>
<seg id="527"> Health. </seg>
<seg id="528"> Then, Zoe, the genius comes up to take a picture of me. </seg>
<seg id="529"> You do not see a fuck, it's dark to die. </seg>
<seg id="530"> She is with the car in her hand and says: "Go a little further." And I'm going. Then: "Another little." And I'll go back a bit. Then: "Another little." And I'm moving. </seg>
<seg id="531"> I realize I'm on the edge of a 2-meter-high concrete ditch, with inside a mountain of shit, stones, broken bottles, and giant mice. And if I was in that suck, I could break the bone of my neck. </seg>
<seg id="532"> Then I start shouting: "Zoe, fuck, you just did not kill me!" </seg>
<seg id="533"> We start laughing like crazy, we walk a little bit and Zoe starts to crawl and disappears. Do you know where it was going? Within that fucking ditch. </seg>
<seg id="534"> - Good good. - Thank you, thank you very much. </seg>
<seg id="535"> I remember taking a step and looking down and meanwhile, I thought, "This is the ditch that Abbie said." - Yeah! I'm plunged in. - And what did he do? </seg>
<seg id="536"> Are you talking about Zoe, the cat? Anything. </seg>
<seg id="537"> If I fell down, they would pull me out with a teaspoon. </seg>
<seg id="538"> Zoe fell perfectly to his feet. </seg>
<seg id="539"> But then I reflected on me and I was a little depressed. </seg>
<seg id="540"> Zoe ends up in that ditch and nothing is done. </seg>
<seg id="541"> In fact, we laugh over it. </seg>
<seg id="542"> If I was finished I would be paralyzed. </seg>
<seg id="543"> You can not reason like that. </seg>
<seg id="544"> Each of us owns his talent, that's Zoe's talent. </seg>
<seg id="545"> Of course. If we talk about physics, Zoe is great. Agility, reflexes, looseness ... </seg>
<seg id="546"> - Few human beings flip Zoe on that forehead. - Kim, I love you! </seg>
<seg id="547"> That said, before you become too envious of Zoe's ability, you did not understand the most important part of the story. </seg>
<seg id="548"> You did not fall into the moat. Zoe sÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="549"> Zoe even knew that there was a ditch because you told him, and the same thing fell. </seg>
<seg id="550"> So Lee is right: We all have a lot of talent. - Why does not it look like a compliment? </seg>
<seg id="551"> Kim, do you always have Roscoe? </seg>
<seg id="552"> - Look here, slut. - Oh! I love it. - Me too. </seg>
<seg id="553"> - Fuck is Roscoe? - The Roscoe is a gun. </seg>
<seg id="554"> - Do you have a gun? - Ah-ah. </seg>
<seg id="555"> - And you have permission to have it? - SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="556"> When I was a secret service agent I was given one. </seg>
<seg id="557"> I did not know you were ... </seg>
<seg id="558"> Okay, I did not tell you, okay? Just look at me, I did not say it. God! </seg>
<seg id="559"> - Did you know he had it? - SÃƒÂ¬. Do you want to know if I agree? No. </seg>
<seg id="560"> Did I know that? SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="561"> I do not know in what futuristic utopia you live, but in the world in which I live this bullshit serves. </seg>
<seg id="562"> But you can not deny that today who has a gun tends to be killed far more than anyone who does not have it. </seg>
<seg id="563"> And you can not deny that, as I often go to my laundry room at midnight, I can risk my ass! </seg>
<seg id="564"> - Why do not you try to do it before? 'Fuck! I do the laundry when my dick goes to laundry. </seg>
<seg id="565"> There are other things you can use instead of a gun: pepper spray. </seg>
<seg id="566"> If an asshole tries to violate me, I do not want to irritate the skin. </seg>
<seg id="567"> I want to kill him! </seg>
<seg id="568"> Why do not you bring a knife? </seg>
<seg id="569"> Do you know what happens to knives with the knife? </seg>
<seg id="570"> They fired at him. </seg>
<seg id="571"> Look, if one day they're going to become a famous actress, they will not take the gun. </seg>
<seg id="572"> I'll pay a niggard for a gang and bring him the iron. </seg>
<seg id="573"> If anything happens, I'll be watching, but until then I'm in war. </seg>
<seg id="574"> So, Zoe, did you think what you want to do? </seg>
<seg id="575"> Yeah, girls, I know exactly. </seg>
<seg id="576"> Really? And what the fuck do you want to do? </seg>
<seg id="577"> It would not make sense for me to stay in America without driving a muscle car. </seg>
<seg id="578"> I want to drive a Dodge Challenger, enjoy the way and go to the ball! </seg>
<seg id="579"> We can ask the car department of the movie. - Must a Dodge Challenger work? - And that's not enough. </seg>
<seg id="580"> It must be a 70's Dodge Challenger with 440 engine. </seg>
<seg id="581"> And how dare you do that? </seg>
<seg id="582"> Quiet, beauty, I've arranged everything. </seg>
<seg id="583"> When I decided to come, I went online and found out that the local newspaper here in Tennesse is the Lebanon News Sentinel. </seg>
<seg id="584"> And at my home ... - Sorry, where do you live? Australian? </seg>
<seg id="585"> - What do you mean by that? - Zoe is a New Zealander. You never have to, never say, give a Australian Kiwi. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Unless you want to take a lot of wood. </seg>
<seg id="587"> I did not know, I'm sorry ... </seg>
<seg id="588"> Be quiet, we're just taking your ass. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Auckland, to answer your question. </seg>
<seg id="590"> Anyway, I subscribed to the newspaper a month ago. </seg>
<seg id="591"> But why? What do you need a cafe magazine in New Zealand? </seg>
<seg id="592"> If you close that mouthpiece, I try to tell you. </seg>
<seg id="593"> I read the newspaper all month and checked ads looking for machines for sale. </seg>
<seg id="594"> So just yesterday, right here in this city, there is one willing to sell a Dodge Challenger in the 1970s with a 440 engine painted in white. </seg>
<seg id="595"> And how the fuck do you buy it? </seg>
<seg id="596"> Maybe I'm stupid, but I'm not yet reincarnated. </seg>
<seg id="597"> I mean that maybe I buy it, so it makes me a test drive. </seg>
<seg id="598"> What reminds you of a white 70's Dodge Challenger? </seg>
<seg id="599"> - Kowalski! - "Punto Zero" Kowalski, slut slut! </seg>
<seg id="600"> That movie is a classic. If I get that asshole to drive me alone, with the open doors I fly that bastard! </seg>
<seg id="601"> What's "Zero Point"? How, what's Zero Point? </seg>
<seg id="602"> Abbie, I always do the part of the ignorant. </seg>
<seg id="603"> It is one of the best American movies of all time! </seg>
<seg id="604"> Truly, Zoe, many girls do not know "Zero Point". </seg>
<seg id="605"> Sorry, did you tell many girls? And what the fuck would you be? </seg>
<seg id="606"> Yeah, but we're car fanatics, so we saw it. </seg>
<seg id="607"> You grew up looking at "Beautiful in pink." </seg>
<seg id="608"> - I like "Belle in pink". </seg>
<seg id="609"> - Here you see? Why did not you look at John Hughes's movies? </seg>
<seg id="610"> I was looking at them. I'm a female, me. </seg>
<seg id="611"> But I also looked at all those on the engines. </seg>
<seg id="612"> "Zero Point", "Zozza Mary, Crazy Gary," "Out in 60 Seconds." </seg>
<seg id="613"> The true one. Not that shit that Angelina Jolie did. </seg>
<seg id="614"> In Auckland there is an open-air cinema that makes "Punto Zero", "A Merry Christmas", in short all the classics. It's a shame! </seg>
<seg id="615"> What the fuck do you play? What do you want? Is she selling a 70's Dodge Challenger? </seg>
<seg id="616"> For this, princesses. </seg>
<seg id="617"> Fuck this, it's an absolute hack! </seg>
<seg id="618"> Mythical, absolutely mythical! </seg>
<seg id="619"> It's a real fairy tale. I apologize only for a moment, I would like to speak privately with my members. </seg>
<seg id="620"> Take it easy, ladies. </seg>
<seg id="621"> What are you waiting for? Ask him if he is driving you. - Now I'm talking to you, but first I have to ask you something. - Thing? </seg>
<seg id="622"> If he lets us take the sun, I want to rethink the Ship's Mast. - Fuck, no! - Lower your voice! </seg>
<seg id="623"> Forgive me for Ship's Mast. </seg>
<seg id="624"> - Jesus Christ! - Do not blaspheme. - Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="625"> So, what did you say last time? </seg>
<seg id="626"> - I know what I said. - What did you say? </seg>
<seg id="627"> - We did not have to do it anymore. - No, you did not say "we did not have to." </seg>
<seg id="628"> You said, "We will never do it anymore." - SÃƒÂ¬, ma. - "But," a fuck, Zoe. </seg>
<seg id="629"> You said that we would never have done that fucking game and that if I had tried to do what you wanted to do, I had to refuse, and I also had permission to physically prevent you from doing so, did you understand? Did you say it or did not you tell her? </seg>
<seg id="630"> - Ma. - No, no. Reply, ugly bitch! </seg>
<seg id="631"> - Did you say it or did not you tell her? - Yeah, I told you. Anyway ... I cry for you and "anyway". </seg>
<seg id="632"> Okay, I know I said that and I know I was serious. </seg>
<seg id="633"> - Yeah, you were serious. - Yeah, but I did not mean to do it in America. </seg>
<seg id="634"> - But please! - Yeah, it's real, fuck. </seg>
<seg id="635"> I meant we no longer had to do it in New Zealand or Australia. </seg>
<seg id="636"> You're a big liar. </seg>
<seg id="637"> Look, I know what I said and when I said it, but when I told her I did not know I would come here. </seg>
<seg id="638"> And if I knew I'd come to America and be able to play Ship's Mast on a Challenger dick at the "Zero Point", I would definitely have added a "anyway." I got it? </seg>
<seg id="639"> Okay, you will look strange, but I really understand. </seg>
<seg id="640"> Anyway, just because you're convinced of these stupid bitches, does not mean I've drunk my brain. </seg>
<seg id="641"> - They need two people for that fucking game and I refuse. - Ah. </seg>
<seg id="642"> It will be your friend of heart. </seg>
<seg id="643"> I do not need you if you're on the other side of the planet. </seg>
<seg id="644"> - Do I scratch your back? - You would still cut me off. </seg>
<seg id="645"> Yeah, but I got another thing in mind. </seg>
<seg id="646"> From now on, as long as you are here, your slave-back-slave will be yours. </seg>
<seg id="647"> You will do it whenever you want, you do not even have to ask me. </seg>
<seg id="648"> You'll get me the order, you say, "Nice to do." </seg>
<seg id="649"> You kick my back, you massage my feet and after the shower put me the moisturizer on the buttocks. I'm in. </seg>
<seg id="650"> Let's see if the monster lets us try the car without him. </seg>
<seg id="651"> If you leave her, you wait here, we'll be back soon. </seg>
<seg id="652"> Thing? </seg>
<seg id="653"> - I said: If the monster lets us try. - I heard what you said. Only I can not believe what you said. </seg>
<seg id="654"> - You both have a face. - Why? </seg>
<seg id="655"> Do not be fooled with me. I was awake all night, I'm still a bit drunk and I have a headache. </seg>
<seg id="656"> I should be in the hotel to sleep, not crawling on the Tobacco Way, but as Zoe wants to drive a dick car from "Punto Zero", I'm here. </seg>
<seg id="657"> And you have an ass to ask me, no, delete the last one, tell me that I have to make a conversation with Tom Joad while the jokes go to play? I cry, I do not listen to you. </seg>
<seg id="658"> - It's not so. - So how is it, Kim? - We must leave you as a guarantee. </seg>
<seg id="659"> The monster will never accept it if we leave it all away. </seg>
<seg id="660"> I believe that only one pledge pledges as a guarantee. </seg>
<seg id="661"> - You do not like what we want to do. - Drive a car? </seg>
<seg id="662"> - This is something more. - CioÃ¨? Are you going fast? </seg>
<seg id="663"> - Something more. - If you did not understand, we're doing a great favor, because we're doing a shit. But we're stunted, we do not have good sense. </seg>
<seg id="664"> But you have good sense and anyone who has good sense will not do what we will do. </seg>
<seg id="665"> - Who tells you I do not want to do that? - Abbie, you're a mom. - SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="666"> We should be a mythical posse, but this is the excuse you use whenever you want to exclude me from something. </seg>
<seg id="667"> What are you dreadful about doing and that I'm so little I'm not even able to understand? </seg>
<seg id="668"> Look, since we try to rub the monster, it would be better not to go into the details while watching us. </seg>
<seg id="669"> And then, darling, surely they will not let us. </seg>
<seg id="670"> Okay, feel if you like it. </seg>
<seg id="671"> I will convince him. But if I can, I come with you. </seg>
<seg id="672"> - And how do you think they do? - This is my problem. </seg>
<seg id="673"> But be sure the monster will say yes. </seg>
<seg id="674"> How are you going to do it, a superpump? </seg>
<seg id="675"> No! </seg>
<seg id="676"> I'll tell Lee Lee will do a blowjob. </seg>
<seg id="677"> - How does he do it? - It's not great, but let me do it. So, did you buy it? </seg>
<seg id="678"> Okay, mama, listen. </seg>
<seg id="679"> Do you want to skip it with the straights? Then you have to act like a pussy. </seg>
<seg id="680"> If you come with us, you will not say "fuck" and "shit". </seg>
<seg id="681"> - You sit back and I do not want to hear a breath, you know? - Clear. </seg>
<seg id="682"> If you complain, we stop in the middle of the street, kick your ass and take you back. - Agree. </seg>
<seg id="683"> Okay, do your magic. </seg>
<seg id="684"> - Hello Sir. - Hello. - What's your name? - Jasper. </seg>
<seg id="685"> - Hi, Jasper, I'm Abernathy. - Aber what? - Abernathy. </seg>
<seg id="686"> - And how do you name it? - This is my name. </seg>
<seg id="687"> - What the fuck is your name? - Call me Abbie too. - Okay, Abbie. </seg>
<seg id="688"> Jasper, me and my friends would like to know if we can take the car for a test ride to see if we really like it. </seg>
<seg id="689"> - Why should I do this shit? - To sell his car better. </seg>
<seg id="690"> How do I know that you do not fuck her? </seg>
<seg id="691"> For four reasons, Jasper. One: We're not thieves, two: Doing so would be rude, three: We're staying at the Days Inn in the city. </seg>
<seg id="692"> Call the hotel, ask for directions. We booked throughout the month. </seg>
<seg id="693"> In fact, Zoe no, but Kim and I do, so we can absolutely be traced. </seg>
<seg id="694"> - Who is Kim, the Negro? - Yeah, Kim would be the color girl. </seg>
<seg id="695"> Reason number four, which is the most important: As we take the car for a ride, she will have the great opportunity to do a thorough acquaintance with our friend Lee. </seg>
<seg id="696"> I seem to have seen it. </seg>
<seg id="697"> - She thinks she has seen her because she's a famous actress. - Ah! </seg>
<seg id="698"> - Why is it so tanned? - We're shooting in a Hollywood movie, and it's a cheerleader movie and she's one of the cheerleaders. </seg>
<seg id="699"> - A cheerleader movie? - A movie about cheerleaders. </seg>
<seg id="700"> - But what is a porn? - Yeah, right. </seg>
<seg id="701"> - But do not talk to her, she's very timid. - Timid? </seg>
<seg id="702"> Lee, he's Jasper. Jasper, Lee. </seg>
<seg id="703"> I recommend, kids, do not bother. </seg>
<seg id="704"> See you, splendor. We come to take you later. </seg>
<seg id="705"> Hi, Treasures. Do good. </seg>
<seg id="706"> Gulp. </seg>
<seg id="707"> Do you think what I think? </seg>
<seg id="708"> - Yeah, I think so. - What are you thinking about? </seg>
<seg id="709"> I'm thinking we told you to close that cock of mouth. </seg>
<seg id="710"> - Where are you going now? - Do not move. - I run to piss. </seg>
<seg id="711"> So, do you feel ready? </seg>
<seg id="712"> - Safety? - I always do not want to do it before I do. </seg>
<seg id="713"> - I do not know if you understand. - Of course I understand, because I do not want to do it. </seg>
<seg id="714"> - Kim! - I'm just talking. </seg>
<seg id="715"> - If you take away all the fun ... - I'm just talking. </seg>
<seg id="716"> Do you want to start from above? </seg>
<seg id="717"> But surely I start from above, I can not enjoy myself. </seg>
<seg id="718"> Take. </seg>
<seg id="719"> - No, no, I put it, the jacket. - But the jacket is mine. Look! </seg>
<seg id="720"> No. The chances are you made me my slave. </seg>
<seg id="721"> - Give it to me. - I'm going out on that cock fuck. Roof a dick! You're on the bonnet. </seg>
<seg id="722"> Girls, a car is coming. - Give me the belt. - Oh! </seg>
<seg id="723"> - But this is my favorite. - Fuck! </seg>
<seg id="724"> - Fuck you, take that of Abernathy. - But ... Okay, we'll use his. </seg>
<seg id="725"> - Belt, force. - No. ÃƒÃ † Prada. - Do not do the bitch, come on. - Magic words. </seg>
<seg id="726"> - Please, out of my belt. - Just because you were pretty. </seg>
<seg id="727"> - It's cute to be nice, Kim. - Brava. </seg>
<seg id="728"> Do you know what? Do not even ask me the next time you get your hair. </seg>
<seg id="729"> So do me the same. </seg>
<seg id="730"> Why do you ask me when nobody sees you. </seg>
<seg id="731"> You're not that bad. I do not give you some shit. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Abernathy, now do not break the balls. I have other things for the mind. </seg>
<seg id="733"> - How scary! - Look, I'm not six. </seg>
<seg id="734"> - Do you mind, raise the windows? - No. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Now, Abernathy, look what I do. </seg>
<seg id="736"> It's out of the window! What the fuck do you do ?! </seg>
<seg id="737"> Wow! </seg>
<seg id="738"> Push that fucking pedal! Get gas! What if that's enough for that dry ass! </seg>
<seg id="739"> Abernathy, move your front legs. </seg>
<seg id="740"> All right. </seg>
<seg id="741"> Oooh ... </seg>
<seg id="742"> Let's see now, bitch, we run even more. </seg>
<seg id="743"> - OMG! - What the hell is that? </seg>
<seg id="744"> Fuck! </seg>
<seg id="745"> Now! </seg>
<seg id="746"> - Did you tell him something? - Nothing, I swear. </seg>
<seg id="747"> - Shit! </seg>
<seg id="748"> - Forgive me for everything! - Forgive me, now thrust, fuck! </seg>
<seg id="749"> Go away! </seg>
<seg id="750"> Shit! I do not see a fuck, I do not see a fuck! </seg>
<seg id="751"> - Do a little bit, do you excite yourself? - You're a fucking whore! </seg>
<seg id="752"> Wrap it up, fuck it! </seg>
<seg id="753"> Get ready to fly, bitch! </seg>
<seg id="754"> - No! - Zoe, do not give up! </seg>
<seg id="755"> It's glued to us, you got it behind us. </seg>
<seg id="756"> Hey! </seg>
<seg id="757"> Hey, lord, this is a shame! </seg>
<seg id="758"> Well, adiÃƒÂ²s! </seg>
<seg id="759"> Oh, fuck! </seg>
<seg id="760"> Bitch! </seg>
<seg id="761"> Run, bastard, run! Get out, big bitch! </seg>
<seg id="762"> What the hell did I think? She is Zoe, the cat woman! </seg>
<seg id="763"> We got close, eh? </seg>
<seg id="764"> Dov'ÃƒÂ¨? Where the maniac is over? </seg>
<seg id="765"> I fired him and the bastard if he spun it. </seg>
<seg id="766"> - Do we want to go get it? - Of course he does. </seg>
<seg id="767"> Look ... You're coming down, huh? </seg>
<seg id="768"> Do not say shit. </seg>
<seg id="769"> Let's dry it. </seg>
<seg id="770"> - Okay, put your ass back then. - All right. </seg>
<seg id="771"> Bastard son of a bitch! </seg>
<seg id="772"> - One moment. - But where the hell are you going? - I'll do it immediately. </seg>
<seg id="773"> Let's see ... This! Now we can go, okay? </seg>
<seg id="774"> Yeah, fuck, if it's okay. Come here, load that stuff. </seg>
<seg id="775"> Just do it! Just do it! Just do it! </seg>
<seg id="776"> And now what are you doing, do not you laugh? Do not you have fun, old dick? </seg>
<seg id="777"> Where do you go, old shit? Where do you go? </seg>
<seg id="778"> You wanted to sow, shit shit, but here we are, behind your ass! </seg>
<seg id="779"> Next! Here we are! Cha Cha arrives! </seg>
<seg id="780"> - You were just a shit shit! - Yeah, sorry. - That? - I did not want to do anything, I just wanted to play. </seg>
<seg id="781"> Ah! He just wanted to play! Well, I do not play with you. </seg>
<seg id="782"> Do not run away, do not run away, bastard! </seg>
<seg id="783"> It's not a blind road. It's not a blind road. </seg>
<seg id="784"> Help! </seg>
<seg id="785"> Help! </seg>
<seg id="786"> - Asshole! </seg>
</doc>
<doc docid="hollow" genre="subtitles" sysid="sys">
<seg id="1"> Need help! Is there anyone? </seg>
<seg id="2"> Ichabod Crane, are you? </seg>
<seg id="3"> No one else, and I'm not alone. </seg>
<seg id="4"> I found something that was recently a man. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Burn him! Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="6"> But we do not yet know the cause of death. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In the river the cause of death is drowning. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It's possible if there's water in the lungs, but with the pathology you can know if he died before finishing in the river. </seg>
<seg id="9"> - I'll have to examine the corpse. - Cut it. Are we pagans? </seg>
<seg id="10"> What happened to him? -Back for tow. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Well done. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The millennium is now at its doorstep. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In a few months we will live in the nineteenth century. But courts still use medieval torture tools. </seg>
<seg id="14"> - Sit down! - I stand it for good sense and justice. Prisons overflow with convictions for worthless confessions, such as this. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Agent Crane! </seg>
<seg id="16"> We've heard you this song more than once. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Two streets are open before me. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The first: let you refresh your ideas in a cell, until you understand the respect for the dignity of my office. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Forgive me, but how do I ever realize that we have to use the brain for essential clues to solve the crimes and resort to modern scientific techniques? </seg>
<seg id="20"> Which leads me to the second street: there is an indoor village, two days trip north, in the Hudson Islands. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It's a place called Sleepy Hollow. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Have they talked to you? - That's right. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It is a community of farmers, mostly Dutch. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Three people were killed in two weeks. </seg>
<seg id="25"> They found her with her head cut off from her torso. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Get out of my bust? Yeah, like the stem of a flower. </seg>
<seg id="27"> You will carry your modern experiments at Sleepy Hollow and you will have to get to the killer. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Bring it here, in front of our honest justice. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Will you do this? I'll do it. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Remembers, you are now, Ichabod Crane, to be put to the test. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Pickety witch. The Witch! </seg>
<seg id="32"> Who will bribe Pickety witch? </seg>
<seg id="33"> Pickety witch. Who will bribe Pickety witch? </seg>
<seg id="34"> - Is Theodore? - Forgive me, I'm a stranger. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Then, a kiss in advance. </seg>
<seg id="36"> I'm looking for Baltus Van Tassel. </seg>
<seg id="37"> I'm his daughter, Katrina Van Tassel. </seg>
<seg id="38"> We did not hear your name. I did not say that. Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="39"> You are a rude! The voice is not raised here. </seg>
<seg id="40"> It is to raise the spirit in these dark times, which I and my wife are giving this petticoat. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Young man, you're welcome even if you sell something. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Thank you sir. I'm Agent Ichabod Crane, sent from New York to investigate the murders at Sleepy Hollow. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Then Sleepy Hollow is grateful to you, Agent. </seg>
<seg id="44"> And I hope you will stay in this house. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Well said, dear. Come on, we'll set you up. Music! </seg>
<seg id="46"> Sorry, ma'am. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Thank you. Tell Mr. Van Tassel that I'll be down in a moment. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Right away, sir. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Thanks to God you are here. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Excellent, get in! Leave us, my dear. </seg>
<seg id="51"> They joined us: Dr. Lancaster, Reverend Steenwyck, Magistrate Samuel Philipse, and finally James Hardenbrook, the notary. </seg>
<seg id="52"> - And you, sir? </seg>
<seg id="53"> - A simple farmer who has been successful. </seg>
<seg id="54"> The city addresses me as a friend and adviser. </seg>
<seg id="55"> And possessor and banker. We proceed? </seg>
<seg id="56"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Then three people were assassinated. </seg>
<seg id="58"> First, Peter Van Garrett and his son Dirk Van Garrett. They were both strong and capable men. Found together, decapitated. </seg>
<seg id="59"> A week later, the Winship widow. She is also decapitated. </seg>
<seg id="60"> Now you will need to ask a lot of questions. </seg>
<seg id="61"> But before, tell me: is someone suspected? </seg>
<seg id="62"> What did your superiors explain to you? </seg>
<seg id="63"> That the three were killed in the full campaign. </seg>
<seg id="64"> The heads are separated from their bodies. </seg>
<seg id="65"> No, they were not found at all. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Have the heads gone? </seg>
<seg id="67"> They were taken by the headless knight and brought to hell. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Forgive me, I do not ... It's better that you sit down. </seg>
<seg id="69"> SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="70"> The knight was a Hessian mercenary, sent here by a German princess To hold the Americans under the yoke of England. </seg>
<seg id="71"> Unlike his compatriots who came for money, the rider came for the sake of carnage. </seg>
<seg id="72"> When you joined the battle, you found him there. </seg>
<seg id="73"> A giant black genius rode: Temerario. </seg>
<seg id="74"> He spun the horse in battle, thrusting the galloping heads. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Her teeth had been covered up to make them sharp, to make her appearance more fierce. </seg>
<seg id="76"> This butcher found its end in the winter of '79 in our forests to the west. </seg>
<seg id="77"> His head swung with his sword. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Even today, that place is infested by spirits and nobody ventures. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Because that day was planted the seed of evil. </seg>
<seg id="80"> And so it has been for twenty years. </seg>
<seg id="81"> But now he is awakened and in the fury of revenge he will cut the heads where he will find them. </seg>
<seg id="82"> Is this what you believe? </seg>
<seg id="83"> See is to believe. </seg>
<seg id="84"> You have brought equipment and books for scientific investigations. </seg>
<seg id="85"> This is the only book I recommend you read. </seg>
<seg id="86"> I see. </seg>
<seg id="87"> By telling Steenwyck, gentlemen, homicide does not need ghosts from the tomb. </seg>
<seg id="88"> We have murder in New York without goblins and spells. </seg>
<seg id="89"> You are away from New York. </seg>
<seg id="90"> The assassin is a man in flesh and bones, and I'll find it. </seg>
<seg id="91"> Come out, devil. </seg>
<seg id="92"> It's called Powder Powder. It should be fine ... </seg>
<seg id="93"> Thank you. - Good luck if you need calls. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="95"> Do not worry about anything. You will see that everything will be resolved. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Thomas, at home! </seg>
<seg id="97"> Go for breakfast. She also kisses mom for me. </seg>
<seg id="98"> The knight has killed again! </seg>
<seg id="99"> Up, Shot Powder, you leave. Power! </seg>
<seg id="100"> On the other side! </seg>
<seg id="101"> Good horse! </seg>
<seg id="102"> Mr Miller, come back with the coffin wagon. Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="103"> - Keep your eyes open. </seg>
<seg id="104"> Reassure me, there I am now. </seg>
<seg id="105"> The fourth victim, Jonathan Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="106"> I see. </seg>
<seg id="107"> And your head? </seg>
<seg id="108"> Jack. Jack. </seg>
<seg id="109"> - Very interesting. - What? </seg>
<seg id="110"> It usually removes the head to prevent identification. </seg>
<seg id="111"> But we know it's Jonathan Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="112"> Exactly. So why is the head removed? </seg>
<seg id="113"> PerchÃƒÂ ©? Exact. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Did you move the corpse? SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="115"> You never have to! PerchÃƒÂ ©? </seg>
<seg id="116"> Why not! </seg>
<seg id="117"> The swing is gigantic! </seg>
<seg id="118"> The aggressor overwhelmed Masbath, shot the horse, and went back to claim his head. </seg>
<seg id="119"> Yeah, there's a chemical reaction. </seg>
<seg id="120"> Show that there was a single, powerful shot at the neck. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Power. Interesting. - What? </seg>
<seg id="122"> The wound is instantly cauterized as if the blade was bled but there are no bruises. The devil's fire! </seg>
<seg id="123"> Beware, it is written in the first letter of St. Peter, paragraphs 5 to 8, because your opponent, the devil, runs like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour. </seg>
<seg id="124"> God welcomes Jonathan Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="125"> Mr agent! Ah, are you the young Masbath? </seg>
<seg id="126"> I was the young Masbath. Now I am the only one. </seg>
<seg id="127"> At your service. Morally forced to avenge my father. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Only and unique Masbath, thank you. But you will be more useful to your mother. </seg>
<seg id="129"> My mother is in heaven. </seg>
<seg id="130"> Now my dad cares for her, you have no one. I'm your man! - You have great courage. But I can not care about you. </seg>
<seg id="131"> I'm sorry for your loss. </seg>
<seg id="132"> - Agent Crane. Mr. Philipse. </seg>
<seg id="133"> You must know. </seg>
<seg id="134"> Jonathan Masbath was not the fourth victim, but the fifth. - The fifth? Yeah, five victims in four graves. </seg>
<seg id="135"> Young Masbath! Found a place in Van Tassel's lodgings. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Wake up before dawn. I hope you have a strong stomach. </seg>
<seg id="137"> Peter Van Garrett, Dirk Van Garrett, </seg>
<seg id="138"> Jonathan Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="139"> Five victims, four tombs. </seg>
<seg id="140"> The widow Winship. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Bring it inside the widow! </seg>
<seg id="142"> - It's an irregular thing. Yes, but necessary. </seg>
<seg id="143"> We have to work immediately. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Work? She's dead. </seg>
<seg id="145"> I mean they'll need the operating table. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Here, too, the wound on the neck is cauterized. </seg>
<seg id="147"> The sword of the stomach, as well. </seg>
<seg id="148"> But to what purpose? </seg>
<seg id="149"> What is your purpose? </seg>
<seg id="150"> What tools are these? I am of my own creation. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Go out, young Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Thank you, Mr. Killian. If you do not mind, Doctor, I can not concentrate when I'm observed. </seg>
<seg id="153"> What are they going to do? What will happen to your head? What did you do to her? </seg>
<seg id="154"> This is a mentally ill person. </seg>
<seg id="155"> What did you find out? </seg>
<seg id="156"> The Winship widow was pregnant. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Who is lÃƒÂ? </seg>
<seg id="158"> Forgive the intrusion. No intrusion. </seg>
<seg id="159"> I come here to read when they are sleepless. </seg>
<seg id="160"> Read books to hide? They were my mother. My father feels that the novels were love to kill her. </seg>
<seg id="161"> He's dead, two years in the winter. </seg>
<seg id="162"> The nurse who cares for her now is Lady Van Tassel. </seg>
<seg id="163"> There is another thing. Why did not anyone tell me that the Van Garrett are Van Tassel's relatives? </seg>
<seg id="164"> All families in Sleepy Hollow are related to blood or marriage. </seg>
<seg id="165"> I see. </seg>
<seg id="166"> This land gave the Van Garrett to my father. They were the richest family. </seg>
<seg id="167"> When we came here, Van Garrett systemed us into a land acre with a dilapidated cottage. My father works hard. She made a fortune and built this house. I need him my happiness. </seg>
<seg id="168"> I remember when we were poor in the lodge. </seg>
<seg id="169"> Do you want me to show you? SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="170"> Bring it on, it's my gift to you. </seg>
<seg id="171"> I do not need it. Are you so sure of everything? </seg>
<seg id="172"> It was your mother. Keep it close to your heart, it's a protection against evil. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Are you so sure of everything? </seg>
<seg id="174"> Strange these signs. What are? I always remember them. </seg>
<seg id="175"> As a child I played beside this fireplace. </seg>
<seg id="176"> My first drawing school. My mother was my teacher. </seg>
<seg id="177"> You see, sculpted on the chimney wall? The archer. I forgot about it. </seg>
<seg id="178"> It was long before we came here. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Do you feel good? Yeah, thank you. </seg>
<seg id="180"> A red cardinal! My favorite. </seg>
<seg id="181"> I want to tame one, but I do not feel like fooling it. </seg>
<seg id="182"> So, I got one thing for you. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Red cardinal, an empty cage. </seg>
<seg id="184"> And now... </seg>
<seg id="185"> Do you know how to make spells? Teach me! </seg>
<seg id="186"> It's not magic. That's what we call optical illusion. Separate images join in rotation. </seg>
<seg id="187"> It's the truth, but the truth is not always what appears. </seg>
<seg id="188"> What are you fleeing from, Philipse? Damn! </seg>
<seg id="189"> -Did you help me? Yeah, and now I live in terror ... of powers from which there is no defense. </seg>
<seg id="190"> How did you know Winship widow was pregnant? </seg>
<seg id="191"> - She told you. - I want you to be your father. - I'm not the father. Did you reveal the name? </seg>
<seg id="192"> SÃƒÂ¬. He came to me for a board of magistrates to protect the rights of his son. </seg>
<seg id="193"> I should have kept the secret but ... </seg>
<seg id="194"> Do you think he killed the man? - The knight killed her. </seg>
<seg id="195"> How many times do I have to tell you, there is no knight. </seg>
<seg id="196"> - What's that? - My talisman. - It protects me from the knight. </seg>
<seg id="197"> You, a magistrate, with the head full of these nonsense! Tell me the name ... </seg>
<seg id="198"> My God! </seg>
<seg id="199"> Agent Crane! </seg>
<seg id="200"> Did not go out for nothing? </seg>
<seg id="201"> - He was a headless knight! - Do not worry. </seg>
<seg id="202"> - He was a headless knight! You are here for this. </seg>
<seg id="203"> You have to believe me! Headless! </seg>
<seg id="204"> I know. - No! You were not there! </seg>
<seg id="205"> - It's all true! - We all said it. </seg>
<seg id="206"> I saw it! </seg>
<seg id="207"> I guess he'll be back in town. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Okay, this time, I'll go to New York in person. </seg>
<seg id="209"> I do not let an amateur detective run. </seg>
<seg id="210"> This time the dead man is a magistrate! </seg>
<seg id="211"> I need men capable of going to the woods to the west. </seg>
<seg id="212"> We thought you would not have more cartridges! </seg>
<seg id="213"> I have won my fears, I want to locate the knight's tomb. </seg>
<seg id="214"> In short, I'm against a murderous ghost. </seg>
<seg id="215"> Who is with me? </seg>
<seg id="216"> I. </seg>
<seg id="217"> Van Garrett, widow Winship, your father Jonathan Masbath, and now Philipse. There must be a link. </seg>
<seg id="218"> Did your dad have business with Van Garrett? </seg>
<seg id="219"> He worked for them, we lived in the shelter. There is nothing else. </seg>
<seg id="220"> But one night, one week before the murder, there was a quarrel upstairs between father and son. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Then Mr. Van Garrett called my dad. </seg>
<seg id="222"> A quarrel between father and son ... </seg>
<seg id="223"> Then Van Garrett calls the servant, Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="224"> Listen. </seg>
<seg id="225"> - I do not feel anything. Not even me. </seg>
<seg id="226"> No birds. No cricket. It's all quiet. </seg>
<seg id="227"> Accelerate your pace. </seg>
<seg id="228"> Forgive the intrusion but maybe you can help us. - Come on that mortuary? Yeah, in a way. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Precisely I do not hypothesize about your occupation. </seg>
<seg id="230"> Nothing about witch ways ... they're awesome. Yeah, awesome ways. </seg>
<seg id="231"> It's the same, whatever you are. To each his own. Do you know the knight? </seg>
<seg id="232"> That of Hessia? That one, madame! You come with me. Get out of here, baby. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Stay away, whatever you feel. </seg>
<seg id="234"> What could you feel like having to get away? He goes to Hollow and returns. I feel! I know the blood on him. - Really? </seg>
<seg id="235"> I'm here to find it And let it stop. I can give you the knowledge of the underworld. </seg>
<seg id="236"> -What do you do? Do not move, do not talk! </seg>
<seg id="237"> When the other one arrives, I'll handle it. </seg>
<seg id="238"> - The other? Is coming! </seg>
<seg id="239"> Can you hear me? </seg>
<seg id="240"> Are you looking for a knight without blood head? </seg>
<seg id="241"> Follow the Indian path until the sun dies until the dead tree. Sit down where your knight rests. </seg>
<seg id="242"> Let's go. Quickly! </seg>
<seg id="243"> Take the Indian path up to the Dead Tree. </seg>
<seg id="244"> -What do we recognize it? Without difficulty, I'm afraid. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Then get down to the place where he rests. </seg>
<seg id="246"> His camp? - His tomb. </seg>
<seg id="247"> Stay here. </seg>
<seg id="248"> Not a gesture, turn around! I got a gun! </seg>
<seg id="249"> Katrina, I could kill you! Why are you here? </seg>
<seg id="250"> Because no one wanted to follow you. </seg>
<seg id="251"> Now they are twice as strong. It's your white magic. </seg>
<seg id="252"> The dead tree. </seg>
<seg id="253"> Blood. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Stay where you are. </seg>
<seg id="255"> -What is this? Stay there, do not move! </seg>
<seg id="256"> This tree is a passage between two worlds. </seg>
<seg id="257"> The ground has been ruined. The ground is broken. </seg>
<seg id="258"> Take the shovel! </seg>
<seg id="259"> The skull has disappeared. </seg>
<seg id="260"> That's why the knight returns from the tomb. </seg>
<seg id="261"> He takes tests as long as his will not come to him. </seg>
<seg id="262"> Ichabod! </seg>
<seg id="263"> Let's split. Glenn, Theodore. </seg>
<seg id="264"> Do not tease your teeth, you will teach Thomas bad habits. </seg>
<seg id="265"> I'm a bad habit. Oh really? - That's good, and a nanna. SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Escape! </seg>
<seg id="267"> You are good. </seg>
<seg id="268"> - It's not you who you want! - I fix it! </seg>
<seg id="269"> We can not defeat him! </seg>
<seg id="270"> Such a wound would have to kill him. </seg>
<seg id="271"> But no points are needed and there is almost no blood loss. </seg>
<seg id="272"> You have to be quiet, you have the fever. </seg>
<seg id="273"> Katrina! </seg>
<seg id="274"> Nostradamus mediamus. Milk of Mercy. </seg>
<seg id="275"> I tried to stop Brom ... </seg>
<seg id="276"> Drink, you will sleep. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The knight did not want to kill Brom nÃ © me. </seg>
<seg id="278"> If Brom did not attack her! After that, rest! </seg>
<seg id="279"> I discovered that the rider did not casually knock. </seg>
<seg id="280"> His victims are chosen by someone who controls him. </seg>
<seg id="281"> The same person who took his skull. </seg>
<seg id="282"> Someone in the flesh and bones he knew where to dig. </seg>
<seg id="283"> As I have always said. They're boiling! Drink. </seg>
<seg id="284"> You were dreaming. SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="285"> Things I forgot about. </seg>
<seg id="286"> - And I do not want to remember more. - Tell me what you dreamed of. </seg>
<seg id="287"> My mother was an innocent. A daughter of nature. </seg>
<seg id="288"> Condemned, murdered ... by my father. </seg>
<seg id="289"> Murdered? To save her soul from a wicked fanatic with the mask of righteousness. </seg>
<seg id="290"> I was seven years old when I lost faith. </seg>
<seg id="291"> What do you think then? - In the criterion and in the reason. </seg>
<seg id="292"> Cause and consequence. I should not have come to this place. My rational mind has been rebuffed by the spirit world. Do not you find anything here so it's worth it to come? </seg>
<seg id="293"> No, no, no. </seg>
<seg id="294"> A kiss from a beautiful young man before he saw my face and knew my name. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Without criterion or reason. </seg>
<seg id="296"> Forgive me, I talk about kisses ... </seg>
<seg id="297"> You lost your Brom. - I poured tears for Brom, but I do not have the broken heart. - Do you find it unsuitable? - No. </seg>
<seg id="298"> Maybe there's a little witch in you. Why do you know this? Because you got me astonished. </seg>
<seg id="299"> - You slept like a dead man. Too good, I do not deserve it. </seg>
<seg id="300"> Served by the hostess. - Oh, you would not. But our servlet is gone. Sarah? Run like so many others. They go for fear. </seg>
<seg id="301"> - Where's Katrina? He watched you until dawn. Now it's up to her to sleep. </seg>
<seg id="302"> I'm ready for another day. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Enough to face a deadly adversary. </seg>
<seg id="304"> Dr. Lancaster, Reverend Steenwyck, Notary Hardenbrook, and Magistrate Philipse who tried to give us a cut and received it in which Philipse was killed. </seg>
<seg id="305"> Here is a conspiracy. </seg>
<seg id="306"> The doctor and the reverend, the notary and the magistrate. </seg>
<seg id="307"> What is the secret that keeps them united? </seg>
<seg id="308"> Philipse knew that the widow was pregnant, and did not want to tell me the father's name. </seg>
<seg id="309"> What does this mean? </seg>
<seg id="310"> We have to go for elimination. </seg>
<seg id="311"> They'll make a list of the people of Sleepy Hollow. Beginning with his first citizen, Baltus Van Tassel. </seg>
<seg id="312"> - I feel we are very close. SÃƒÂ¬. I guess Baltus is the first citizen now that Garrett is dead. SÃƒÂ¬, and Van Garrett. I almost forgot them! </seg>
<seg id="313"> - Come with me! Where? - By the notary Hardenbrook. Do you have an idea? Yeah, an idea! </seg>
<seg id="314"> Hopeless. </seg>
<seg id="315"> My dad's folder. Why is this here? </seg>
<seg id="316"> Leave me alone! Notary Hardenbrook! </seg>
<seg id="317"> As soon as you have shown Van Garrett's will. Leave everything to his son. - He died with him. Therefore inheritance goes to the closest relative. </seg>
<seg id="318"> Naturally. All legal and without cheating. -Sir! I'm a dead man! </seg>
<seg id="319"> Van Garrett's seal, broke. </seg>
<seg id="320"> He seems to have written a new one, shortly before dying, naming heir ... the widow Winship. </seg>
<seg id="321"> And here, look, a marriage certificate. </seg>
<seg id="322"> Van Garrett had secretly married the widow. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Leaving everything to her and to the unborn baby. </seg>
<seg id="324"> The new will lies between the fortunes of Van Garrett and the person who would have inherited everything. We four have been involved against our will. </seg>
<seg id="325"> You four? It means... </seg>
<seg id="326"> Of course. the four old citizens. </seg>
<seg id="327"> Now I understand the roles you had. </seg>
<seg id="328"> The Reverend Steenwyck knew the secret because he had married them, Dr. Lancaster was in charge of the pregnant woman Philipse's magistrate provided the protection of the law, and the notary Hardenbrook occult the documents that had been given by Van Garrett to his faithful servant. </seg>
<seg id="329"> The four conspirators involved in the plot. </seg>
<seg id="330"> We did not know it was a death plot! </seg>
<seg id="331"> I have not finished! </seg>
<seg id="332"> First, the Van Garrett was killed by a rider born from the grave, then a widow invokes the estate. </seg>
<seg id="333"> And away his head. But homicide is the cause of homicide. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Servant, Jonathan Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="335"> When father and son fluttered for the new testament, </seg>
<seg id="336"> Jonathan Masbath was called to be a witness. </seg>
<seg id="337"> Here is his signature. It was his death sentence. </seg>
<seg id="338"> The knight has the system. </seg>
<seg id="339"> The system was ordered by someone who had power over him. </seg>
<seg id="340"> Someone had dug in the woods to the west and stole the skull. </seg>
<seg id="341"> The missing head that must be returned to the knight. </seg>
<seg id="342"> Someone who could get or lose a fortune. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Van Garrett's closest relative: Baltus Van Tassel! </seg>
<seg id="344"> -Why are you here? - Because it's your room. </seg>
<seg id="345"> - Was it unsuitable? - No. </seg>
<seg id="346"> You missed me, where have you been? From the notary. </seg>
<seg id="347"> - I had to talk to Hardenbrook. Did you know anything? </seg>
<seg id="348"> It can be. </seg>
<seg id="349"> - My father ... your dad? Yeah, my dad thinks you should go back to New York. Really? And Why Why? </seg>
<seg id="350"> Maybe he looked at your log and did not like what he saw. </seg>
<seg id="351"> What have you got? Tests. </seg>
<seg id="352"> Now, sorry, I have to ask you ... - I leave you to your reflections. </seg>
<seg id="353"> It's just a spider. Kill him! No, hit it! </seg>
<seg id="354"> - It's something below. Thing? </seg>
<seg id="355"> Let's move the bed. I can not, do it. </seg>
<seg id="356"> The evil eye! Someone is making an invoice. </seg>
<seg id="357"> The evil eye! </seg>
<seg id="358"> Wait here. </seg>
<seg id="359"> You burned the evidence. - So you will not blame my dad. </seg>
<seg id="360"> Do not accuse anyone, but if there is any fault I can not alter the thing. Not even an invoice can alter it. </seg>
<seg id="361"> Your father takes advantage of these murders. </seg>
<seg id="362"> If I knew you would not have this opinion. </seg>
<seg id="363"> Or try something for me. - They are held back by reasoning. </seg>
<seg id="364"> What the friends conspire ... You're the agent, not me. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Find other reasonings and let me stay. </seg>
<seg id="366"> I can not do it, neither the one nor the other thing. And my heart is affrighted. I do not think you have a heart. I was thinking of giving you mine. </seg>
<seg id="367"> SÃƒÂ¬. You loved me to follow me in the woods and to face that danger. </seg>
<seg id="368"> There was no danger to me if my father controlled the knight. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Goodbye. Malay the day you came to Sleepy Hollow! </seg>
<seg id="370"> - Katrina will not see you. Did not say anything? </seg>
<seg id="371"> Only that will not come down. </seg>
<seg id="372"> I understand, thank you. - Agent! </seg>
<seg id="373"> You have not asked me yet how badly I was in my hand, it would have been very kind. </seg>
<seg id="374"> You have been careful not to look at it and not talk about it. </seg>
<seg id="375"> I regret. How did you ... - I know you've seen me! Thing? - You followed me last night. </seg>
<seg id="376"> You promise not to tell my husband. Promise! </seg>
<seg id="377"> The city is in a hurry. Hardenbrook is dead! </seg>
<seg id="378"> That old-fashioned old man? - He's hanged tonight. Hanged? </seg>
<seg id="379"> Steenwyck called for a church assembly for tonight. </seg>
<seg id="380"> Every woman, man or child will pronounce against you! </seg>
<seg id="381"> If you are wise, leave this place! </seg>
<seg id="382"> Cos'ÃƒÂ¨? I was flabbergasted with the kitchen knife. </seg>
<seg id="383"> - The wound looks serious. - Later the fascia with wild maranas. I know where they grow. </seg>
<seg id="384"> Hurry up! The bell of the assembly rattles! </seg>
<seg id="385"> - The Knight! Katrina! Father! </seg>
<seg id="386"> Save me! </seg>
<seg id="387"> He killed your stepmother! God! </seg>
<seg id="388"> Fire! </seg>
<seg id="389"> You will kill us all! It is you who wants it! </seg>
<seg id="390"> Can not come in! </seg>
<seg id="391"> Can not come in! - Why should we die for you? </seg>
<seg id="392"> - Can not cross the gate! We have to save ourselves! </seg>
<seg id="393"> The next one touched me, will have a bullet! </seg>
<seg id="394"> Do not go! </seg>
<seg id="395"> There have been dead days. We confess our sins. </seg>
<seg id="396"> - What do you know? - They told you the fake. </seg>
<seg id="397"> We have been possessed diabolically by ... </seg>
<seg id="398"> Get away! Back! </seg>
<seg id="399"> Back! </seg>
<seg id="400"> Here is a conspiracy! I'll smash it! </seg>
<seg id="401"> An evil spirit possessed you. </seg>
<seg id="402"> Please God that you are satisfied and that you are in peace. </seg>
<seg id="403"> The evil eye did his job. My life is over. Saved for a life of horrors in sleep and awakening aches. </seg>
<seg id="404"> Goodbye, Katrina. </seg>
<seg id="405"> Believe it was Katrina, did not it? You never have to say it! </seg>
<seg id="406"> Strange kind of witch, with a loving and kind heart. </seg>
<seg id="407"> - How can you think that? - I have a good reason. </seg>
<seg id="408"> You are scared of reason. - I'm down to reason. </seg>
<seg id="409"> It's a tough lesson for a tough world. Learn it well. </seg>
<seg id="410"> Infamy has many masks. The most dangerous is the virtue. </seg>
<seg id="411"> Goodbye. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Get the carriage, go back! </seg>
<seg id="413"> Forgive me! </seg>
<seg id="414"> No blood nor coagulation nor scratching. When the cut was done this woman was dead. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Adorable child, you have the air of seeing a ghost. </seg>
<seg id="416"> Again, my dark genius. </seg>
<seg id="417"> Another night of decapitation. Get up with your sword! </seg>
<seg id="418"> One head for a head. </seg>
<seg id="419"> My sacrilegious knight, come on! </seg>
<seg id="420"> Come on now for ... Katrina! </seg>
<seg id="421"> Finally wake up! Did you think it was a bad dream? </seg>
<seg id="422"> Dad saw the knight kill you! </seg>
<seg id="423"> He saw the rider coming toward me with his sword pulled. But I'm the governor of the knight. </seg>
<seg id="424"> And Baltus did not look at it. </seg>
<seg id="425"> But there was a corpse! Serve, Sarah. </seg>
<seg id="426"> I've always found it useless. </seg>
<seg id="427"> But a utility has demonstrated it. </seg>
<seg id="428"> Who are you? The name of my family ... was Archer. The archer! </seg>
<seg id="429"> I lived with my father, my mother and sister not far from here. As long as my father died. And the landlord we had always served faithfully, we'll bust. </seg>
<seg id="430"> No one wanted to welcome us because my mother was suspected of witchcraft. </seg>
<seg id="431"> But she instruct her daughters at art, while we were living in the woods to the west. </seg>
<seg id="432"> MorÃƒÂ¬ within a year. </seg>
<seg id="433"> My sister and I stayed in our shelter. </seg>
<seg id="434"> Without seeing a soul, until one day ... gathering wood, we met the Hessian mercenary. </seg>
<seg id="435"> I saw his death. </seg>
<seg id="436"> At that moment I offered my soul to Satan, if he had risen the knight to avenge me. </seg>
<seg id="437"> Revenge? Yeah, of Van Garrett. </seg>
<seg id="438"> He had no pity and hunger for us, while Baltus Van Tassel with his wife and daughter was rubbing us home. </seg>
<seg id="439"> I swear I would become the mistress of everything she had. </seg>
<seg id="440"> It was easy. I came into your house as your nurse's nurse, put my body in a coffin and mine in my double bed. </seg>
<seg id="441"> It was not so easy to secure my legacy. </seg>
<seg id="442"> The widow had to disappear, of course </seg>
<seg id="443"> and also the servant Masbath. Then days later, midwife Killian told me that the widow had revealed a secret to her. </seg>
<seg id="444"> She told me right in front of her husband, what a goof! </seg>
<seg id="445"> Another work for the knight. </seg>
<seg id="446"> Lust has led the Reverend Steenwyck in my power. </seg>
<seg id="447"> Fear did the same with Hardenbrook and Philipse. </seg>
<seg id="448"> And the doctor's silence I got in exchange for my complicity, in her fornication with Sarah servant. </seg>
<seg id="449"> Yeah, you got it all right now. - No. </seg>
<seg id="450"> You have everything, dear, to your father's will. I'll have it all with your death. </seg>
<seg id="451"> By the way, my sister suddenly died. </seg>
<seg id="452"> Rather recently. </seg>
<seg id="453"> Did you kill your sister? - She wanted it herself. Helping you and your master. </seg>
<seg id="454"> Just in time To make you cut your head. </seg>
<seg id="455"> The rider arrives and tonight is for you! </seg>
<seg id="456"> Thank God! </seg>
<seg id="457"> Beware of the head! </seg>
<seg id="458"> On the roof! I have an idea. </seg>
<seg id="459"> Jump on the blades! </seg>
<seg id="460"> Jump! </seg>
<seg id="461"> Soon! </seg>
<seg id="462"> Is dead? The problem was that he was dead. </seg>
<seg id="463"> - Where do we go? Get out of here! </seg>
<seg id="464"> Get the reins! </seg>
<seg id="465"> Ichabod! </seg>
<seg id="466"> The bag! </seg>
<seg id="467"> Jump! </seg>
<seg id="468"> - Still alive? Scappa, Katrina! </seg>
<seg id="469"> Yeah, go, jump and jump! </seg>
<seg id="470"> Take it, it's yours! </seg>
<seg id="471"> You're not dead! </seg>
<seg id="472"> Knight! </seg>
<seg id="473"> Just in time for the new century! </seg>
<seg id="474"> You will soon be going, young Masbath. </seg>

<seg id="1"> It is a very common mistake, it is believed that the imagination of a writer is always at work, which constantly inventes thousands of events, of episodes, that create his stories from nothing. </seg>
<seg id="2"> In fact, the opposite is true. </seg>
<seg id="3"> When people know you are a writer, they bring you stories and characters and as long as you keep your observing and listening skills attentive, these stories will continue to ... </seg>
<seg id="4"> Stop it. Stop it! No! Do not do it! </seg>
<seg id="5"> They will continue to find you throughout your life. </seg>
<seg id="6"> To those who have told other stories, many stories will be told. </seg>
<seg id="7"> - Sorry. - It's all OK. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The following events have been described exactly as I will present them and in a totally unexpected way. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Several years ago, suffering from a mild form of "Writer's Fever", a type of common neurastenia between the Intelligence of Time, I decided to spend the month of August in the spa town of Nebelsbad downstream of the Sudetenwaltz, and I stayed at the Grand Budapest , A picturesque, elaborate and well celebrated hotel. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Many of you will have heard of it. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It was in the low season, and at that time completely out of fashion, had already begun its decline towards squalor and possible demolition. </seg>
<seg id="12"> With the other few guests, we soon came to recognize each other as the only inhabitants of the vast building, although I do not remember there was any other confidences beyond the polite notes of the boss we exchanged encountering in the palm grove in Arab baths and at the funicular . </seg>
<seg id="13"> We were a very reserved group, it seemed, and lonely, with no exception. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Perhaps precisely because of this general silence, I found a familiar acquaintance with the concierge of the hotel, a Western Noto like Monsieur Jean, whose laziness hit me but, at the same time, great courtesy. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Suspicion was not at all well paid. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Anyway, one night, as I became conversant with Monsieur Jean, I noticed a new presence in the group. A gentle and old gentleman dressed elegantly with an exceptionally intelligent and lively face and a perceiving aura of sadness. </seg>
<seg id="17"> He was sitting alone, like all of us but I must say that he was the only one who really seemed deeply alone. </seg>
<seg id="18"> That was also a symptom of my medical condition. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Who is that old gentleman? I asked Monsieur Jean. </seg>
<seg id="20"> With my astonishment, he was taken aback. </seg>
<seg id="21"> - He does not know? - Churches. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Do not you recognize him? </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact it seemed familiar to me. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Mr. Moustafa is in person. </seg>
<seg id="25"> It came this morning. </seg>
<seg id="26"> This name will undoubtedly be familiar with the most elated of you. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Mr. Zero Moustafa was the richest man in Zubrowka and the owner of the Grand Budapest. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Comes often and stays here for a week or more, three times a year, never in high season. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Monsieur Jean made me sign and I came near. </seg>
<seg id="30"> I'll tell you a secret. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It always takes a single and no bath room in a corner of the top floor. It's smaller than the service lift! </seg>
<seg id="32"> He was well known, Zero Moustafa had bought and lived in some of the most sumptuous castles and palaces in the continent. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Yet here, in his half-empty hotel, was he occupying a dachshund? </seg>
<seg id="34"> At that moment, the curtain opened on a domestic drama ... Shit. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Which required the immediate and total attention of Monsieur jean, but who, in sincerity, did not capture mine for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Anyway, this intrusion in the story of the strange old man had left me, as it is said, "gespannt wie ein Flitzebogen", that is, on the thorns, and on the thorns I stayed all the following morning, until, in his usual manner of mysterious act And infallible, the fate once again moved to my place. </seg>
<seg id="37"> I admire her work. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Excuse me? </seg>
<seg id="39"> I said I know and admire her wonderful work. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Thank you very much, sir. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Monsieur Jean felt he would exchange a word or two about the senior owner of this building? I have to admit she asked her. Monsieur Jean is absolutely capable, of course, but one can not say he is a first class concierge, nor in honesty, even second. </seg>
<seg id="42"> But it does. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Times have changed. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The spa baths are really great. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Originally they were. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Obviously I could not keep them. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Too decadent for modern taste. </seg>
<seg id="48"> But I love her, too, these lovely old ruins. </seg>
<seg id="49"> How did you buy the Hotel, if I can ask? </seg>
<seg id="50"> The Grand Budapest. </seg>
<seg id="51"> I did not. </seg>
<seg id="52"> If you did not just ask for education, and please tell me if this is the case, but if this story seriously interests you, I invite you to dine with me tonight, and it will be my pleasure and honor to tell you "my story." As well as. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Two roasted ducks with olives. </seg>
<seg id="54"> Rabbit, salad? </seg>
<seg id="55"> '52 Poully-Jouvet and a quarter of brut's champagne bottle. </seg>
<seg id="56"> This should give us plenty of time - if I hesitate to get started. </seg>
<seg id="57"> - Of course. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Well, it starts with the predecessor of our common friend. </seg>
<seg id="59"> The beloved first concierge of the Grand Budapest. </seg>
<seg id="60"> Start with ... </seg>
<seg id="61"> - The table near the window. - Yes, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="62"> - The tray on the table. - Right away, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="63"> There. Those were brushed? </seg>
<seg id="64"> - Of course, Monsieur Gustave. - In the hoods. </seg>
<seg id="65"> - What about Oberstdorf & Co.? </seg>
<seg id="66"> - I think so, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="67"> - In the second trunk. Who has the tickets? - I, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Give them to me. </seg>
<seg id="69"> They're in order. Wait in the corner. </seg>
<seg id="70"> - I will not go anymore. </seg>
<seg id="71"> - How, excuse me? </seg>
<seg id="72"> - I will not go anymore. - Why not? </seg>
<seg id="73"> - I'm scared. - And what? </seg>
<seg id="74"> I'm afraid this may be the last time we see you. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Why should this be so? </seg>
<seg id="76"> Well, I can not explain it in words, but I hear it. </seg>
<seg id="77"> Divine goodness, there is no reason to leave if you are so ... </seg>
<seg id="78"> - Come with me. - In that lick of Lutz? </seg>
<seg id="79"> - Please. - Give me your hand. </seg>
<seg id="80"> It has nothing to fear. You're always a little anxious before you leave. </seg>
<seg id="81"> I admit that this time you are more than usual. </seg>
<seg id="82"> But, honestly ... Oh, Holy Heaven. </seg>
<seg id="83"> What did you do to your nails? </seg>
<seg id="84"> - How, excuse me? - This naughty nail polish. </seg>
<seg id="85"> - The color is completely wrong. - You do not like it? </seg>
<seg id="86"> It's not that I do not like it, it repels me physically. </seg>
<seg id="87"> - Maybe I know what can relax you. - Thing? No, do not play. </seg>
<seg id="88"> - Shh, listen to the words. - Please, not now. </seg>
<seg id="89"> "Ramingo, one night in a noble streak of cinereal sparrows of pines, I drifted into a frosty stone, misty rain, diaphanous, the inscription for a long time, almost seemed to be read in the nubile cracks ..." </seg>
<seg id="90"> Would you light a candle for me? </seg>
<seg id="91"> - In the sacristy of Santa Maria? </seg>
<seg id="92"> - I will personally cover myself. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Remember, I'll always be at your side. </seg>
<seg id="94"> - I love you. </seg>
<seg id="95"> - I love you. </seg>
<seg id="96"> It is not easy to earn a woman's devotion for 19 consecutive seasons. </seg>
<seg id="97"> - Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="98"> - I'm really fond of you, you know. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="100"> But I had never seen her so before. </seg>
<seg id="101"> No, sir. </seg>
<seg id="102"> It tore like a stitched dog. </seg>
<seg id="103"> Very true. </seg>
<seg id="104"> Drive to the Cathedral of Santa Maria in Brucknerplatz. </seg>
<seg id="105"> Buy a simple, medium length candle And take 4 Kubeck's rest. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Light it up in the sacristy, say a short rosary then go to Mendl and take a courtesan au chocolat. </seg>
<seg id="107"> If coins are being made, from the kid to the cripple shoeshine. </seg>
<seg id="108"> - Right away, sir. - Wait. </seg>
<seg id="109"> - Who are you? </seg>
<seg id="110"> - I'm Zero, sir. The new Lobby Boy. </seg>
<seg id="111"> - Zero, did you say that? - Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="112"> - I've never seen or heard you call. - Who has hired you? </seg>
<seg id="113"> Mr. Mosher, sir. - Mr. Mosher! </seg>
<seg id="114"> Yes, Monsieur Gustave? </seg>
<seg id="115"> It seems to me that you have clandestinely assumed this young man in the role of Lobby Boy. </seg>
<seg id="116"> He was hired for a trial period pending his consent. </seg>
<seg id="117"> Maybe yes. Thank you, Mr. Mosher. </seg>
<seg id="118"> It's a pleasure, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="119"> Now you will be officially interviewed. Do I have to go first to turn on that jar, sir? </seg>
<seg id="120"> Thing? No. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Experience? </seg>
<seg id="122"> Hotel Kinski, garzone, six months. </seg>
<seg id="123"> Hotel Berlitz, servant, three months. </seg>
<seg id="124"> - Before it was even disheveled ... - Experience: zero. </seg>
<seg id="125"> - Thanks again, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="126"> - Straighten that cap, Anatole. </seg>
<seg id="127"> - Pleasure is mine, Herr Schneider. - The strap is broken. </seg>
<seg id="128"> - These are unacceptable. - I totally agree. </seg>
<seg id="129"> - Education? - I studied reading and writing. </seg>
<seg id="130"> I started elementary schools. I have almost... </seg>
<seg id="131"> - Education: zero. - This time it exploded. </seg>
<seg id="132"> Good day, Cicero. Call a damned plumber! </seg>
<seg id="133"> - This afternoon, Monsieur Gustave? </seg>
<seg id="134"> - No doubt, Frau Liebling. </seg>
<seg id="135"> - What the hell is this? - Not now. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Family? </seg>
<seg id="137"> Zero. </seg>
<seg id="138"> Sixth, Igor. </seg>
<seg id="139"> Why do you want to be a Lobby Boy? </seg>
<seg id="140"> Well, who would not want to be at Grand Budapest, sir? </seg>
<seg id="141"> It's an institution. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Very well. </seg>
<seg id="143"> - Mille Klubeck. - My goodness. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Have you ever been a Lobby Boy, sir? </seg>
<seg id="145"> What do you believe? </seg>
<seg id="146"> Well, I guess you should have started somehow ... </seg>
<seg id="147"> - Go to turn on that damned crier. - Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="148"> And so, he started my life. </seg>
<seg id="149"> Aspiring Junior Lobby Boy, Grand Budapest Hotel, under the strict command of Monsieur Gustave H. </seg>
<seg id="150"> I became his pupil, and he was my guardian and supervisor. What is a Lobby Boy? </seg>
<seg id="151"> A Lobby Boy is completely invisible but always under eye. A Lobby Boy remembers what customers hate. A Lobby Boy anticipates customer needs even before they need it. </seg>
<seg id="152"> A Lobby Boy is, above all, discreet to the unlikely. Our guests know that their deeper secrets, some of which, frankly, rather inadequate, will bring them with us to the grave. - So keep your mouth shut, Zero. - Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="153"> It's all for now. </seg>
<seg id="154"> I began to realize that many of the hotel's most esteemed and distinguished guests came for him. He seemed to be an essential part of his duties. </seg>
<seg id="155"> ... But I think it was also a pleasure. The requirements were always the same. </seg>
<seg id="156"> They had to be rich, deprived, insecure, vanity, superficial, blond, needy for attention. Why are you blonde? </seg>
<seg id="157"> Because they were all. He was, moreover, the most generously fragrant man I ever met. The fragrance announced its arrival far away. And persisted for long minutes when he left. I worked six days a week, half a day on Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="158"> Our meals were poor but frequent, to withstand better. Two breakfasts, two lunches and a night meal. Monsieur Gustave also held a daily talk. Rudeness is a mere expression of fear. </seg>
<seg id="159"> People are afraid not to get what they want. The most unpleasant and horrible person just needs to be loved, and it will open like a flower. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A verse goes with me: "The paintbrush's brush kissed that young niffle" with his agile bristles "and with his pompous sweetness, he restored his empty goats." </seg>
<seg id="161"> He consumed his dinner alone in his room. </seg>
<seg id="162"> The hotel owner's identity was unknown to us all. </seg>
<seg id="163"> Every month his emissary, known as Vice Kovacs, came to check the records and communicate messages on behalf of the mysterious owner. </seg>
<seg id="164"> On these occasions, Monsieur Gustave and our trade manager, Herr Becker, met him privately over the Reception. </seg>
<seg id="165"> It was then that I met Agatha, but we will not talk about it. - What do you want? - Look. </seg>
<seg id="166"> Good God. </seg>
<seg id="167"> I'm sorry, sir. </seg>
<seg id="168"> - We have to go to her. - We have to? </seg>
<seg id="169"> Tout de suite. You need me, and I need you for the bags and so on. </seg>
<seg id="170"> - How can you crawl out? - 5 minutes. </seg>
<seg id="171"> Just do it. And she puts a bottle of Pouilly-Jouvet in '26 in a bucket of ice with two glasses So there will not be any drink of cat's piss in the carriage restaurant. </seg>
<seg id="172"> It's all my fault. He tried to tell me about his premonition. I did not hear it. The whole Lutz will be in mourning, except for his false, demonic children whom he hated and could not bear kissing on his cheek. They will dance like gypsies. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Nothing really makes sense in life, since it can end all from one moment to the next ... </seg>
<seg id="174"> And immediately afterwards, comes the rigor mortis. Oh, the best always die young. </seg>
<seg id="175"> With a little luck, he left some Klubeck to your old friend, but you never know until the ink on the death certificate is dry. </seg>
<seg id="176"> It was a bed-bomb, among other things. </seg>
<seg id="177"> He was 84, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="178"> I had older ones. </seg>
<seg id="179"> As young people, they all point to the fillet and the lettuce, but over the years, you have to move on less valuable cuts, which is fine to me because they prefer them. They are more flavorful, or so they say. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Why are we stuck in a barley field? </seg>
<seg id="181"> Hey, hello, folks. Documents. With pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="182"> The photo does not honor me, I'm afraid. I was considered a very nice man. </seg>
<seg id="183"> What's the "F" for? Fritz? Franz? </seg>
<seg id="184"> - Franz. - I knew it! </seg>
<seg id="185"> He's making a grimace. </seg>
<seg id="186"> It's a residence permit with a third-tier employee status, my dear Franz. </seg>
<seg id="187"> And with me. </seg>
<seg id="188"> Come on, please. </seg>
<seg id="189"> Wait a minute. Sit down, Zero. His visas are in order. </seg>
<seg id="190"> I personally checked them with the Bureau of Labor and Servitude. </seg>
<seg id="191"> He can not stop him just because he's a damned immigrant. </seg>
<seg id="192"> He did nothing. </seg>
<seg id="193"> Stop it, damn it! </seg>
<seg id="194"> No matter, Monsieur Gustave! Let them do it! </seg>
<seg id="195"> Ow! Ouch! </seg>
<seg id="196"> Damned, Dirty, Disgusting Fascist beasts! </seg>
<seg id="197"> Keep your hands down from my Lobby Boy! </seg>
<seg id="198"> What's the problem? </seg>
<seg id="199"> All this is shameful. </seg>
<seg id="200"> This young man works for me at the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad. </seg>
<seg id="201"> Monsieur Gustave? </seg>
<seg id="202"> My name is Henckels. </seg>
<seg id="203"> I am the son of Dr. Wolfgang Henckels-Bergersdofer. Do you remember me? I know perfectly well who you are. It's incredible. You are the little Albert. I'm terribly embarrassed. Free them. Free them. </seg>
<seg id="204"> Your colleague is stateless. He has to ask for a review of the Special Transit Permit, which at this point could be very difficult to obtain. Take this. </seg>
<seg id="205"> It's time-consuming, but I'm afraid it's the maximum I can do. How is her beautiful mother? - Very well, thank you. - I love it. - Greetings warmly. - I will do it. </seg>
<seg id="206"> His traveling companion was kind as I was when I was a sad child. </seg>
<seg id="207"> My men and I apologize for bothering you. I beg your pardon, sir. </seg>
<seg id="208"> See? There are still dull glories of civilization in this wild slaughterhouse that we call humanity. </seg>
<seg id="209"> It is exactly what we represent in our humble, insignificant ... </seg>
<seg id="210"> Oh, but I'm screaming. </seg>
<seg id="211"> Where is Clotilde? Bring me to her. You're so beautiful, my dear. Really. They did a great job. </seg>
<seg id="212"> I do not know what products they used there in the morgue, but I also want a little. In sincerity, you are better than it has been in recent years. You seem almost alive. </seg>
<seg id="213"> Oh, you changed her in the end. It's perfect. - Clotilde? - Oui, Monsieur Gustave? </seg>
<seg id="214"> A glass of cold water, no ice, for pleasure Ah. All right. </seg>
<seg id="215"> I will not get much, dear. We escorted through a green cloth door, into a narrow service corridor and into the pantry. </seg>
<seg id="216"> An instant later, the kitchen door opened and a minute white dressed robbery glittered. I never forgot the expression on her face. What the hell is going on? </seg>
<seg id="217"> I had never set foot in a home like that in my life. </seg>
<seg id="218"> I knew very little about the subsequent events. </seg>
<seg id="219"> But at some point I knew that when the fate of a great fortune is in the dance, greed goes into the veins like a poison. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Uncles, grandchildren, cousins, relatives of ever-weaker relatives. The faraway family of the old woman came out like cockroaches in search of food. </seg>
<seg id="221"> At the head of that congregation, incredible coincidence, We found our Vice Kovacs, himself an important notary. </seg>
<seg id="222"> He was the executor of the widow's will. This is Madame D.'s will. </seg>
<seg id="223"> It consists of a document written before the death of her husband 46 years ago, and 635 amendments, notes, corrections and letters of intent. Added over the next decades. </seg>
<seg id="224"> The definitive legitimacy of this collection requires further analysis, but in the view of this office, Madame D's intention was to control the majority of his inheritance being transferred to his son, Dmitri, with special diaries for his sisters , Marguerite, Laetitia and Carolina, giving smaller gifts to several members of the extended family as indicated in the Beneficiaries List, which I will read in due course. </seg>
<seg id="225"> Nevertheless. An additional code, which I received by mail only this morning, and without any doubt, sent by Madame D in her last hours of life, contains an amendment to the original certificate, which, as prescribed by law, I will read you now . </seg>
<seg id="226"> The authenticity of this document has not yet been confirmed by the competent court, so I ask all parties to be patient and keep the comments until the necessary investigations are completed. </seg>
<seg id="227"> "To my esteemed friend who has comforted me in my last years" and brought a ray of sunshine to an old woman's life, "which he believed would never be more happy. </seg>
<seg id="228"> "Monsieur Gustave H," I leave in inheritance, net of all taxes "and with full and absolute trusteeship," the painting known as "Boy with apple" ... - Wow! - "... by Johannes van Hoytl ... </seg>
<seg id="229"> - I can not believe. - "... son ..." "What?" "That gave both of them so much pleasure." </seg>
<seg id="230"> Does van Hoytl? - Esentasse? - But can he do that? Who is Gustave H? </seg>
<seg id="231"> I'm afraid I'm dear. That fucking cock! It's a hotel doorkeeper. What's he doing here? I came to bring my homage to a great woman I loved. </seg>
<seg id="232"> - This man is an intruder in my house! - It's not yours yet, Dmitri. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Missing Authentication, and Donation Act ... </seg>
<seg id="234"> You will not have Boy with Apple, damn checca! </seg>
<seg id="235"> And how should this make me feel? </seg>
<seg id="236"> Call the police. We dispute denunciation. </seg>
<seg id="237"> This criminal has afflicted my family for nearly 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="238"> He is a ruthless adventurer and a swindler who plagues old, sick and psychic women. And probably if she fucks her too! </seg>
<seg id="239"> I go to bed with all my friends. Where's Celine? </seg>
<seg id="240"> Thing? She's dead. We are reading his will. </seg>
<seg id="241"> Oh, yes, yes, clear. </seg>
<seg id="242"> If I find out that you have ever touched my mother's body, alive or dead, I swear to God that I cut my throat? I got it? </seg>
<seg id="243"> I thought I'd say I'm a fucking cock. - You are, but you are bisexual. - Let's change subject. I go away. </seg>
<seg id="244"> That painting, Boy with Apple, has no price. I got it? Congratulations, Monsieur Gustave! </seg>
<seg id="245"> They'll make me a war, you fucking bitch. - It's very beautiful? - Beyond every word. </seg>
<seg id="246"> "Finance the Right Bard Can not Sing" That Its Missing And All That Is Not! - "His speech can not ..." - Can I see it? I do not see why not. </seg>
<seg id="247"> This is the gorgeous portrait that Van Hoytl makes of a magnificent boy on the brink of maturity. Blond, refined. White skin like milk. </seg>
<seg id="248"> Of unmatched origin. One of the last in private hands, and no doubt the best. It's a masterpiece. </seg>
<seg id="249"> The rest of the stuff is worthless hooves. </seg>
<seg id="250"> What did he want to tell me first? I do not think I can say it now. </seg>
<seg id="251"> Write me tomorrow. Lutzbahn Station! I will never separate. She remembered them. She'll remember me. Forever. I will die with this picture over my bed. See the similarity? Oh yes. In fact we should sell it. </seg>
<seg id="252"> The sooner is, the better, if they try to steal them in turn. Also, those psychopathic soldiers on the train ... </seg>
<seg id="253"> This could be a difficult war and a long lease of the hotel. For what we know, they could shut up tomorrow. Let's make a solemn covenant of blood. </seg>
<seg id="254"> We contact the black market and sell Boy with Apple by week, then leave the country and hide somewhere along the Maltese Riviera until the storm is over and we will be able to resume our jobs. </seg>
<seg id="255"> In exchange for your help, your loyalty and your service as my personal valet, I promise you 1.5% of the sale price. </seg>
<seg id="256"> - Can we not make 10%? - 10%? Do you fool me? It's more than I owe a real art merchant, and you would not distinguish a chiaroscuro from a bunch of chicken meat. </seg>
<seg id="257"> No, 1.5 is right. But you can hear me: if I die first, and it will surely be so, you will be my only heir. There is not much in the dish except for a set of ivory brushes and my collection of romantic poetry, but when it is time yours will be all along with everything we do not spend in whiskey and prostitutes. This is our sacred covenant. I redesign it instantly. </seg>
<seg id="258"> I, Monsieur Gustave H, relatively capable of understanding, today, October 19, in the year of the Lord 1932 ... </seg>
<seg id="259"> He never told me where to come from. I never wondered where his family was. Excuse me. </seg>
<seg id="260"> There is the police. They ask for her. Tell them to come right away. Okay. </seg>
<seg id="261"> Have you ever been questioned by the authorities? Yes, I was once detained and tortured by rebel militias after the Desert Insurrection. </seg>
<seg id="262"> - You know how it works, then. Shut up. - Sure. You have never heard the word "van Hoytl" in your life. Okay, let's go. How can I help you? Ah, Inspector Henckels. </seg>
<seg id="263"> "By order of the Police Commissioner of the Zubrowka Province," I am arrested for the murder "by Madame Ceine Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis." </seg>
<seg id="264"> I knew there was something suspicious. We did not have the cause of death. She was killed and you believe it was me. </seg>
<seg id="265"> Hey! </seg>
<seg id="266"> Stop! </seg>
<seg id="267"> What happened? </seg>
<seg id="268"> My dear Zero has happened, that I made an ass like a whacky freak called Pinky Bandinski who had the daring to question my virility, because if there is one thing that we learned from appendix novels, Is that when you're in a place like this, you never have to be a girl. </seg>
<seg id="269"> You have to show yourself up right from the first moment. You have to earn their respect. You should see her growl grumpy. In fact, he became a dear friend. You will know it, I hope. </seg>
<seg id="270"> So. Did you talk to Kovacs? </seg>
<seg id="271"> I saw him last night, secretly. </seg>
<seg id="272"> He made me swear in a Bible that I would not tell anyone. </seg>
<seg id="273"> - You must do it too. - I'll do it later. </seg>
<seg id="274"> - You suspect you're innocent. - Obviously. </seg>
<seg id="275"> What is the charge? </seg>
<seg id="276"> At the small hours of the evening of October 19th, </seg>
<seg id="277"> A man known as Monsieur Gustave H, came to the residence of the Desgoffe und Taxis in Lutz and entered the service door without being seen by anyone, </seg>
<seg id="278"> Proceeding for the service staircase and the hallway of the servitude, he entered the private rooms of Madame D. There is no evidence to indicate whether the visit was agreed with her or not. </seg>
<seg id="279"> The following morning, Madame D was found dead for stinging poisoning. Monsieur Gustave was no longer seen in the building until 24 hours later. </seg>
<seg id="280"> The identity of the accusers is explicit in the documents filed. </seg>
<seg id="281"> These include, essentially, all members of the extended family, but the key witness, who seems to have seen the alleged events, seems to have left jurisdiction. Its position is unknown at the moment, but the competent authorities continue to search. </seg>
<seg id="282"> Who is it? </seg>
<seg id="283"> - Serge? - I'm afraid of that. </seg>
<seg id="284"> That bastard. </seg>
<seg id="285"> No I do not believe it. They forced him. I've been in a viper's nest. Do you have an alibi? </seg>
<seg id="286"> Sure, but he is married to the Duke of Westphalia. </seg>
<seg id="287"> I can not allow her name to be contaminated by these dirty business. </seg>
<seg id="288"> - It's a matter of life or death. - I know, but that bastard if it is shaken. </seg>
<seg id="289"> He is already aboard Queen Nasstasja, towards the Dutch Tanganyka. Not soft. </seg>
<seg id="290"> The details of the conspiracy, now of public dominance, were at times unpredictable for us. I am looking for Serge X, a man at the service of my employers, the Desgoffe und Taxis family of Schloss Lutz. </seg>
<seg id="291"> - Yes, sir? - And his sister? </seg>
<seg id="292"> - Yes, sir. - Have you seen him recently? </seg>
<seg id="293"> - No, sir. - Nossignore? </seg>
<seg id="294"> - No, yes. </seg>
<seg id="295"> I have to find it as soon as possible, for her and everyone else's good. </seg>
<seg id="296"> If you see ... </seg>
<seg id="297"> - Yes, sir? - Tell him that Jopling said, </seg>
<seg id="298"> "Back home." </seg>
<seg id="299"> But one thing was certain, Desfogge und Taxis were a very powerful family, and time was not for our benefit. </seg>
<seg id="300"> A letter from Monsieur Gustave. Zero. </seg>
<seg id="301"> - You want me ... - Read it. </seg>
<seg id="302"> "My dear and trusted colleagues ..." </seg>
<seg id="303"> I miss you while I write you from the chains of my unpleasant and mindless imprisonment. </seg>
<seg id="304"> Until I am again free to be among you, Grand Budapest is in your hands, as well as its impeccable reputation. </seg>
<seg id="305"> Immaculate and honored mantle. </seg>
<seg id="306"> Be cautious of his tiniest piece as if you were looking from above like a hawk with a whip between claws, because that's what I do. </seg>
<seg id="307"> I must find a lack of any kind during my absence, I swear that justice will fall on you, quick and ruthless. A great and noble house has been placed under your protection. Tell Zero any strangeness. </seg>
<seg id="308"> "Your devout Monsieur Gustave." </seg>
<seg id="309"> Then there is a poem, but maybe it's best to start the soup since there are 46 verses. </seg>
<seg id="310"> "A rude black ash insects the deer of a rat's dagger" and mixes with dense effusions of marbling wood "while the chanting of a troglodyte ..." </seg>
<seg id="311"> I never trusted that butler. </seg>
<seg id="312"> - It's too honest. - Too honest, you say? </seg>
<seg id="313"> Well, as it is, I find it quickly and solve it. </seg>
<seg id="314"> Can I offer you a soup dish? </seg>
<seg id="315"> No? Nobody? </seg>
<seg id="316"> You, with the big scar on your face? </seg>
<seg id="317"> Try it. It is very warm and nutritious this evening. It takes a pinch of salt. Good day. </seg>
<seg id="318"> Mushroom, gentlemen? Who wants it? </seg>
<seg id="319"> I say good. It's time to get up, hop, hop. Good morning, Pinky. </seg>
<seg id="320"> - Again, Mendl? - That's right. </seg>
<seg id="321"> Who has the cutter blade? - On another planet. - Mendl is the best. </seg>
<seg id="322"> - Well, at work. - Monsieur Gustave? Yup? </seg>
<seg id="323"> I and the guys discussed it. We believe you are a really good guy. Well, I've never been blamed for so much, but I appreciate the intention. </seg>
<seg id="324"> She is one of us now. What a nice thing to say. Thank you, dear Pinky. Thank you, Gunther. Thank you, Wolf. Anything else? Tell him, Ludwig. </seg>
<seg id="325"> The Checkpoint 19 is not a two-money gang. There are thick iron bars at each door, vent and window. There are 72 guards on the plane, and another 16 in the towers. There is a 100-meter jump in a moat full of crocodiles. But like all prisons, it has a weak point, which in this case has the shape of a sewerage system constructed at the time of the first fortification of this fort in the distant Middle Ages. </seg>
<seg id="326"> Now, no one says it's a walk along a tree-lined avenue with an elegant woman and a white poodle, but it's what's called "vulnerability," and this is our daily bread. </seg>
<seg id="327"> Look. Who designed it? What do you mean? I designed it. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Beautiful, you have a wonderful trait, Ludwig. You have a huge artistic talent. Question: How do you intend to penetrate these foundations? They are 60cm reinforced granite masonry, right? Digging with the cutter blade, I guess it takes us three to six months of continuous engagement, during which many of our members will be violently executed. </seg>
<seg id="329"> He hit the sign, Mr. Gustave. We have fake documents, second-hand civilian clothes, a rope ladder made with staves and sheets, but we need digging tools, which are hard to find in this crap. At this point in the story, the Man was suddenly silent and removed his lambskin shoulder. </seg>
<seg id="330"> His eyes darkened like a stormy sky. It was obviously difficult. </seg>
<seg id="331"> - Are you okay, Mr. Moustafa? - I decided to ask him. - No, my dear, at all. - He answered. </seg>
<seg id="332"> It's just that I do not know how to go on. He was crying. </seg>
<seg id="333"> You see, I never talk about Agatha, because only the thought of her name loses control of my emotions. Well, I guess it's useless to turn around. </seg>
<seg id="334"> You see, she saved us. On the day of our third appointment, I asked her hand, and she agreed. </seg>
<seg id="335"> - Do you want to marry me? - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="336"> We did not even have 50 Klubeck in two. Nobody knew, of course, but who would it be? We were both all alone in the world, and we were madly in love. </seg>
<seg id="337"> - Here it is. - Thank you. - It's a book. - I see. </seg>
<seg id="338"> Romantic Poetry, Volume I. Recommended by Monsieur Gustave. I also have a copy of it. - I ruined the surprise, I imagine. - I'll open it anyway. Read the dedication. </seg>
<seg id="339"> Monsieur Gustave kept us in an immediate and scrupulous cross-examination. </seg>
<seg id="340"> Is enchanting. Absolutely lovely. ... during which she gave Agatha a porcelain pendant and five dozen white tulips in a box of the size of a baby coffin. </seg>
<seg id="341"> - He does not feel good. - How, excuse me? </seg>
<seg id="342"> Why is he jealous? She is my girlfriend. She can not give her gifts. I'm just asking a few questions about this delightful view on your own. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Never be jealous, Zero, not even for a moment. Are you trying with us? </seg>
<seg id="344"> - Yes. - I approve this union. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Agatha, honey, come back to your beloved. Soon we discovered ... </seg>
<seg id="346"> I wish you all the good. That Agatha was not just phenomenal with the dough spatula and the cream seals ... </seg>
<seg id="347"> - Mendl. - Go. </seg>
<seg id="348"> But that was also incredibly brave. </seg>
<seg id="349"> I think we were born. Something is missing. A crucial, lost or most likely destroyed document- I do not know what it is, I do not know what it represents, I do not know what it is, but there are traces everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="350"> Now, I do not want to alarm her, and I'm not looking to see significant changes in the magistrates' decisions about her legacy, but above all given the circumstances of her death, and the disappearance of the key witness of the murder, Serge X. I suggest bringing this Case to the attention of the municipal inspector so that there is no doubt in the future about the legitimacy of the verdict. </seg>
<seg id="351"> - Agree? - Do not agree. - Do not agree? - Do not agree. - May I ask you a question, Vilmos? - Of course, Dmitri. - Who do you work for? - How do you say? Who do you work for? I thought you were our lawyer. Well, technically I'm the performer of the will. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In this situation, I represent the deceased. Oh yes? Yes. Payment for my services was included in ... Put things in place and do not create problems, okay? </seg>
<seg id="353"> I'm a notary. I am obliged to act according to law. Do not agree. This thing stinks, sisters. Did my cat knock out the window? I do not think so. - No, did not you do it? - Who, Jopling? Okay. </seg>
<seg id="354"> There's something I did not tell you, Agatha. - Okay. - We stole a picture. It is very precious, perhaps 5 million of Klubeck, in fact. I do not know if they have noticed theft but if something happens to me ... Rubi's artwork? </seg>
<seg id="355"> Just one picture. However, we must have a plan for your survival. Keep this. It's code and you will need a lens to read it, it's written exactly where and how to find Boy with Apple. Do not accept less than half the sale price. Furthermore... </seg>
<seg id="356"> - Zero, I'm a fornaia. - You're a baker. I'm not a recipe, that's the point. I do not sell stolen items. I said that badly. She wanted him to have him. Go to sleep. Yes, Herr Mendl. </seg>
<seg id="357"> - Keep it. - No. </seg>
<seg id="358"> Okay, but take the same. The following day, Herr Becker received a strange news last hour from the office of Vice Kovacs, who sent the planned appointment forever. </seg>
<seg id="359"> Let's get out. </seg>
<seg id="360"> - What are you doing out there? - Close that sewer. </seg>
<seg id="361"> These are here trying to run away. </seg>
<seg id="362"> What the hell is that gonna do to you, a wicked spy? </seg>
<seg id="363"> Guards! Guards! </seg>
<seg id="364"> It is you. Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Thanks, gentle, kind friend. </seg>
<seg id="366"> Okay. </seg>
<seg id="367"> I think you can call a draw. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Good evening. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Let me present you. Pinky, Wolf, Ludwig, this is the divine Zero. </seg>
<seg id="370"> Gunther was killed in the catacombs. </seg>
<seg id="371"> Well, guys, who knows when we will meet again, but if one day ... </seg>
<seg id="372"> Wait. </seg>
<seg id="373"> There is no time for the talk. </seg>
<seg id="374"> Take care of her, Mr. Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="375"> Good luck, boy. </seg>
<seg id="376"> - Where is the refuge? - I did not find it. </seg>
<seg id="377"> No shelter? Seriously? Are we alone out here? </seg>
<seg id="378"> I'm afraid of yes. I asked around, but ... </seg>
<seg id="379"> I see. Too risky. I guess we'll have to improvise. </seg>
<seg id="380"> Let's put on the disguises. </seg>
<seg id="381"> - We already have them. - Not at all. </seg>
<seg id="382"> He had said, fake mustache, fake beard, and so on. </seg>
<seg id="383"> - Did not you bring anything? - I thought you would have grown up. </seg>
<seg id="384"> And it would not have seemed realistic, right? </seg>
<seg id="385"> When they are done well, they are perfectly convincing. </seg>
<seg id="386"> But I understand. That's right. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Give me some Air de Panache spray, please. </seg>
<seg id="388"> - Can I have a splash? - I forgot the Air de Panache. </seg>
<seg id="389"> Have you really forgot the Air de Panache? </seg>
<seg id="390"> Do not believe it, how could you? </seg>
<seg id="391"> I've been in jail, Zero! Can you imagine how humiliating it is? </seg>
<seg id="392"> Puzzo. </seg>
<seg id="393"> Wonderful, right? </seg>
<seg id="394"> I guess I can not wait for better ... where are you from? </seg>
<seg id="395"> - Salim al-Jabat. - That's right. </seg>
<seg id="396"> I guess I can not wait for better at Salim al-Jabat where the most precious personal belongings are a stack of dusty carpets and a hungry goat hungry, and sleeping under a tent trying to survive the scenes. </seg>
<seg id="397"> But that's not how I trained you. </seg>
<seg id="398"> What demon possessed you by persuading you to leave the land that you so obviously have and to walk unusual distances to become a dead immigrant starving in a cultivated and refined society that in all honesty could quietly do without you? </seg>
<seg id="399"> War. </seg>
<seg id="400"> How do you say? </seg>
<seg id="401"> Well, you see, my dad was murdered and the rest of my family executed by a platoon. Our village was razed to the ground and the survivors were forced to flee. </seg>
<seg id="402"> I left because of the war. </seg>
<seg id="403"> I see. So you're more of a political refugee, right? </seg>
<seg id="404"> Right. </seg>
<seg id="405"> Well, I suppose I have to keep up everything I said. What stupid idiot I am. A pathetic idiot. </seg>
<seg id="406"> God, that selfish bastard. </seg>
<seg id="407"> This is shameful, and is well below the standards of Grand Budapest. I apologize for the name of the hotel. </seg>
<seg id="408"> It is not his fault. He was just angry because I forgot the perfume. It's not a justification. I need you to live. </seg>
<seg id="409"> You are a dear and protected friend and I am proud of you. </seg>
<seg id="410"> You have to keep it in mind. </seg>
<seg id="411"> I'm desolate, Zero. </seg>
<seg id="412"> We are brothers. </seg>
<seg id="413"> How is our dear Agatha? </seg>
<seg id="414"> "It was at the dawn that you had your semblance in the moon," and then I returned to every dawn, mesmerized, "by the vice that was on my chest, for ever ..." </seg>
<seg id="415"> Very well. I stop here because the alarm is ringing, but remember where you came because I would insist that you continue later. </seg>
<seg id="416"> I want block posts at every intersection within 50km. </seg>
<seg id="417"> Block trains at each station within 100km. </seg>
<seg id="418"> I want 50 men and 10 hounds ready in 5 minutes. Let us perceive every Pretzel-Haus, Waffel-hut, Biergarten and above all every Grand Hotel from Augenzburg to Zilchbrock. </seg>
<seg id="419"> Those men are dangerous professional criminals. Or at least three of them. </seg>
<seg id="420"> Who are you? </seg>
<seg id="421"> What's he doing here? Civilians are forbidden access to cells. - This is a military investigation. - It's Mr. Jopling, sir. The mother of her employer was one of the victims ... </seg>
<seg id="422"> Hush. </seg>
<seg id="423"> Desgoffe und Taxis family jobs? </seg>
<seg id="424"> Are you aware of the murder of Vice Vilmos Kovacs on October 23? </seg>
<seg id="425"> I am aware of his disappearance. </seg>
<seg id="426"> His corpse was found in a sarcophagus behind a litter box at the late-night Kunstmuseum. </seg>
<seg id="427"> She missed four fingers. </seg>
<seg id="428"> - What do you know about this? - Anything. </seg>
<seg id="429"> Scare Mr. Jopling out of the building. </seg>
<seg id="430"> Mendl. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Central Station, I walk to the Excelsion Palace in Baden-Jurgen, called at the recipient's expense. </seg>
<seg id="432"> We have no choice. We can not do anything else. </seg>
<seg id="433"> Wait, thank you. </seg>
<seg id="434"> It was not our only hope, I would not even have to tell you about her existence. </seg>
<seg id="435"> It is understood that you will never have to talk to a living soul. </seg>
<seg id="436"> - Jury? - Sure. But what is it? </seg>
<seg id="437"> I can not tell you. </seg>
<seg id="438"> How do you find two front row armchairs in the gallery for a first at the Tuscan Opera with one day notice? </seg>
<seg id="439"> How do you arrange a private viewing of the tapestry collection at the Royal Saxon Gallery? </seg>
<seg id="440"> How do you book a corner table at Chez Dominique on Thursday night? </seg>
<seg id="441"> Ivan, dear, are Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="442"> Well, I was up to about 5 minutes ago. </seg>
<seg id="443"> We took the responsibility to go away earlier, if so. </seg>
<seg id="444"> Well, through the sewers. Exactly. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Listen, Ivan, I'm sorry to interrupt it, but we're in trouble. </seg>
<seg id="446"> It's an official request. </seg>
<seg id="447"> I formally request the services of the ... </seg>
<seg id="448"> The call, Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="449"> Good. Attendia </seg>
<seg id="450"> Do you forgive me. Do you prefer to go on foot? </seg>
<seg id="451"> We are here. It's very simple. </seg>
<seg id="452"> Down on the ledge, then on the left. </seg>
<seg id="453"> Jojo, accompany the gentleman to the door. </seg>
<seg id="454"> Take me to Monsieur Georges of Chateau Luxe, please. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Up, damn it, higher up! </seg>
<seg id="456"> Go on. </seg>
<seg id="457"> - Monsieur Georges. - Above. </seg>
<seg id="458"> I see. Immediately. </seg>
<seg id="459"> I take Monsieur Robin from Hotel Côte du Cap, please. ... two and three. </seg>
<seg id="460"> Monsieur Robin. There is a call for her by Monsieur Dino. </seg>
<seg id="461"> Go on. </seg>
<seg id="462"> - One, two and three. - Yes, Dino. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Yes, Dino. Okay, Dino. </seg>
<seg id="464"> I walk Monsieur Martin of the Ritz Imperial, please. </seg>
<seg id="465"> Too much salt. </seg>
<seg id="466"> Too little pepper. </seg>
<seg id="467"> Go on. </seg>
<seg id="468"> - Robin? I'm Martin. - Too much salt. </seg>
<seg id="469"> I heard it, yes. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Maybe. I make some calls. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Serge X, gone. Vice Kovacs, he also disappeared. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Madame D, dead. Boy with Apple, stolen, from us. </seg>
<seg id="473"> Dmitry and Jopling, barbaric ruthless unscrupulous. </seg>
<seg id="474"> Gustave H, latitante. What else? </seg>
<seg id="475"> - Zero, confused. - Zero, confused, of course. </seg>
<seg id="476"> The plot wraps up, as they say. </seg>
<seg id="477"> Why, then? Is it a forest metaphor? </seg>
<seg id="478"> I do not know. </seg>
<seg id="479"> Revenue. </seg>
<seg id="480"> We found the butler. </seg>
<seg id="481"> It is hidden on the remote slope at Gabelmeister Peak. </seg>
<seg id="482"> Our contact has convinced her to meet you tomorrow at noon. </seg>
<seg id="483"> At the observatory on the top. </seg>
<seg id="484"> Do not tell anyone. It will explain everything to you. </seg>
<seg id="485"> Your train starts in 4 and a half minutes. </seg>
<seg id="486"> Here are the tickets. </seg>
<seg id="487"> - Third class? - She was overcrowded </seg>
<seg id="488"> But the ticket was sommelier to Old Versailles. </seg>
<seg id="489"> He advised you. </seg>
<seg id="490"> You will need these for the carriage wagon. </seg>
<seg id="491"> One last thing. </seg>
<seg id="492"> The Air de Penache. </seg>
<seg id="493"> They only had it half an ounce. </seg>
<seg id="494"> We have to offer him something like symbolic gesture. </seg>
<seg id="495"> - How much money do you have? - 42 Klubeck and 3 stamps. </seg>
<seg id="496"> Dame 25. Su. </seg>
<seg id="497"> - Thanks a lot. - Please. </seg>
<seg id="498"> - I have to admit it was good. - Jesus Christ. </seg>
<seg id="499"> I did not expect it. Well, what do you want me to do now? </seg>
<seg id="500"> Talk to your sister again, and you're convincing this time. </seg>
<seg id="501"> Damn son of a bitch. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Christ on the Cross! </seg>
<seg id="503"> What the fuck does that mean? </seg>
<seg id="504"> Boy with Apple? I thought I had hidden it. </seg>
<seg id="505"> - Why do you only notice it now? - I thought I was looking at an expert. </seg>
<seg id="506"> Are you taking me for the ass? </seg>
<seg id="507"> I think it was taken by Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="508"> I'm not angry with Serge. </seg>
<seg id="509"> You can not take it with someone for the total lack of moral fiber. </seg>
<seg id="510"> He is a small, scary, cowardly coward. </seg>
<seg id="511"> - It's not your fault, right? - I do not know. It depends. </seg>
<seg id="512"> Well, you can say anything. </seg>
<seg id="513"> "It depends". Of course it depends. </seg>
<seg id="514"> "Of course that depends," of course it depends. </seg>
<seg id="515"> Yes, I think you are right. Obviously it depends. </seg>
<seg id="516"> This does not mean I will not pull out that small sewage mud. </seg>
<seg id="517"> Anyway, can I marry you? Celebrate the wedding? </seg>
<seg id="518"> With pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="519"> I must say that I find that girl absolutely delicious. </seg>
<seg id="520"> Plain like a table, with that huge Mexico-like desire on his face, to sweat for hours and hours in that daring cooking, while Mendl, by genius, hangs over her like a clumsy gorilla. Yet without a doubt, without a subject of error, you are always and incredibly delightful. </seg>
<seg id="521"> Because? </seg>
<seg id="522"> For its purity. </seg>
<seg id="523"> She admires her, too, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="524"> - Really? - Very. </seg>
<seg id="525"> It's a good sign, you know. It means he understands it. </seg>
<seg id="526"> It's important. </seg>
<seg id="527"> Do not try it with her. A telegram was personally delivered to the girl at 4. The envelope was close to the corpse, but the contents were not there. </seg>
<seg id="528"> In any case, the telegraphic office holds a copy of the tapes for 24 hours. I copied it, and here it is: "Do the suitcases, stop. </seg>
<seg id="529"> "Be ready to go at any time, stop." The hideout is at Gabelmeister Peak, stop. "Destroy this message, with affection, stop." </seg>
<seg id="530"> Where's the basket? Why, from this point, sir? Wake? Going to the sled? Climbs? </seg>
<seg id="531"> By express courier, I wrote to Agatha telling her to reach us at our hiding place. A Gypsy field somewhat out of Nebelsbad, while I and Monsieur Gustave continued east through the Zubrowkian Alps, Towards our high-ranking randez-vous with Serge X Butler. For precaution, we dropped the hidden train to the freighter just outside from the station. </seg>
<seg id="532"> Air de Penache. </seg>
<seg id="533"> Great panorama. I must grant it, for what it is. </seg>
<seg id="534"> I agree. "It is often remarked as a nerve-wise biocoholic -" even in its most extreme and perfect shape ... "- Somebody arrives. </seg>
<seg id="535"> Is she Monsieur Gustave of the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad? </seg>
<seg id="536"> Enter the next cable car. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Is she Monsieur Gustave of the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad? </seg>
<seg id="538"> Change place with me. </seg>
<seg id="539"> Is she Monsieur Gustave of the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad? </seg>
<seg id="540"> Wear these and sing. </seg>
<seg id="541"> - She is Monsieur Gustave of ... - Yes, damn it. </seg>
<seg id="542"> Confess. </seg>
<seg id="543"> I'm innocent. </seg>
<seg id="544"> Eh? No, no. </seg>
<seg id="545"> Forgive me, Monsieur Gustave, I did not want to betray her. </seg>
<seg id="546"> They threatened me with death and now they murdered my only family. No. Who killed this time? </seg>
<seg id="547"> - My lovely sister. - The girl with the wooden leg? </seg>
<seg id="548"> - Yeah. - Damned bastards! </seg>
<seg id="549"> I tried to warn you at the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="550"> I know, my friend. Let's all go. </seg>
<seg id="551"> Listen, I hate making it difficult, but I just have to ask her to rehabilitate me. </seg>
<seg id="552"> - Obviously it's mourning, but ... - There's more. - In this story. - I understand, go ahead. </seg>
<seg id="553"> I have been an official witness, in the presence of Madame D of the drafting of a second testament to be taken into account only in case of violent death. </seg>
<seg id="554"> - A second will? - That's right. - If it was done out. - That's right. </seg>
<seg id="555"> - IS...? - But they destroyed it. </seg>
<seg id="556"> - Oh no. - However... </seg>
<seg id="557"> - Yup...? - I printed a copy. A second copy of the second will? </seg>
<seg id="558"> - That's right. - IS...? </seg>
<seg id="559"> What does he say? Where? What the hell are we talking about? </seg>
<seg id="560"> Do not hold us on the thorns. This is a fucking nightmare. </seg>
<seg id="561"> Tell us what the fuck is going on! </seg>
<seg id="562"> Serge? Serge? Serge! </seg>
<seg id="563"> Hell devils. They strangled him, poor man. </seg>
<seg id="564"> Soon! Come on! </seg>
<seg id="565"> - What do we do if we take it? - I have no idea. </seg>
<seg id="566"> He's a psychopathic assassin. Let's stop. </seg>
<seg id="567"> I can not. I can barely steer. </seg>
<seg id="568"> Pathetic, viscous worm. I hate you. </seg>
<seg id="569"> '' Well, if this is done, it must be my end, either! ' The piercer was wandering, "while the archibugs were thundering and the beers roared for pleasure. "As the bastions ruined." "I think I have swallowed my last lazy," he said ... " </seg>
<seg id="570"> My goodness! You fucked her! </seg>
<seg id="571"> Well done, Zero! </seg>
<seg id="572"> Gustave H! She escaped and escaped justice! </seg>
<seg id="573"> You deliver and I will personally guarantee that it will be handled fairly. </seg>
<seg id="574"> Do not try to escape yet! </seg>
<seg id="575"> - What do you think? - I do not know. </seg>
<seg id="576"> I would lend myself in the strait seat sitting rather than going to jail. </seg>
<seg id="577"> Proposal: We steer the bike to the maniac, recuperate Agatha, we resume Boy with Apple and away on the Maltese Riviera. </seg>
<seg id="578"> Perfect! You're extraordinary, Zero. Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="579"> A moment of silence for a devoted servant brutally killed during the exercise of his duties. Hi, Serge. </seg>
<seg id="580"> OK let's go. </seg>
<seg id="581"> The war started at midnight. </seg>
<seg id="582"> Pfeifelstadt fell to lunch time, under bombing, and 10 battalions overthrew the western border. The supreme command came to Nebelsbad. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Herr Mendl's tribute to the executive staff. </seg>
<seg id="584"> General Stieglitz wants a room overlooking the garden and closet. </seg>
<seg id="585"> Put it in Suite Duca Leopoldo. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Secretary Woroniecki's office was wired. </seg>
<seg id="587"> It arrives one day earlier than expected. Rooms 401, 402 and 403. </seg>
<seg id="588"> Tell the tactical department that we move them to a double on the third floor. </seg>
<seg id="589"> They will need more space for them. </seg>
<seg id="590"> The beginning of the end of the end of the beginning begins. A "Gran Finale" gram-toned on a forgotten piano in a saloon on the edge of a forgotten ghost town. </seg>
<seg id="591"> I will not bear witness to this blasphemy. </seg>
<seg id="592"> Neither do I. </seg>
<seg id="593"> The Grand Budapest became a military camp. </seg>
<seg id="594"> I will never cross my door throughout my life. </seg>
<seg id="595"> - Neither do I. - Never again will I pied ... </seg>
<seg id="596"> Actually, I think we might be coming in now, after all. </seg>
<seg id="597"> Dmitri. </seg>
<seg id="598"> Agatha. </seg>
<seg id="599"> Good evening, Mr. Desgoffe und Taxis. I'm Monsieur Chuck. </seg>
<seg id="600"> We arranged her and her sisters in the King Ferdinand Suite. </seg>
<seg id="601"> Good evening. General von Shrecker asked me to ... </seg>
<seg id="602"> - Who is that? - How do you excuse me? </seg>
<seg id="603"> I think that girl has the picture. Excuse me. </seg>
<seg id="604"> - Sixth. - Wait. </seg>
<seg id="605"> Sixth. </seg>
<seg id="606"> Gifts by Herr Mendl. </seg>
<seg id="607"> I apologize. </seg>
<seg id="608"> Have you seen a bun with a pack under his arm in the last minute and a half? </seg>
<seg id="609"> Yes. He has just entered the elevator with Mr. Desgoffe und Taxis. </seg>
<seg id="610"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="611"> I'm sorry. Who are you? </seg>
<seg id="612"> - Eight, sir, the new Lobby Boy. </seg>
<seg id="613"> - You have not been well trained. </seg>
<seg id="614"> A Lobby Boy never gives such information. </seg>
<seg id="615"> You're a stone wall. Clear? </seg>
<seg id="616"> Nice picture. </seg>
<seg id="617"> Sixth floor. </seg>
<seg id="618"> Where is Boy with Apple? </seg>
<seg id="619"> I'm not your affair! </seg>
<seg id="620"> I'll blow your ass off your ass once and for all. </seg>
<seg id="621"> Put the gun down! </seg>
<seg id="622"> Cease-fire! Cease-fire! </seg>
<seg id="623"> Stop it! </seg>
<seg id="624"> Who is shooting who? </seg>
<seg id="625"> That's Gustave H! Fugitive assassin and art thief. </seg>
<seg id="626"> I trapped it! </seg>
<seg id="627"> That's Dmitri Desgoffe und Taxis! </seg>
<seg id="628"> Responsible for the murders of Vice Kovacs, Serge X and her sister-in-law, and her own mother! </seg>
<seg id="629"> Nobody moves. You are all in stopping. </seg>
<seg id="630"> Who's out at the window? </seg>
<seg id="631"> Agatha! </seg>
<seg id="633"> Hold on! Arrival! </seg>
<seg id="634"> There is something behind the ... </seg>
<seg id="635"> Agatha! </seg>
<seg id="636"> Agatha! </seg>
<seg id="637"> - Are you OK? - I think so. </seg>
<seg id="638"> There is something behind the picture. </seg>
<seg id="639"> He had left everything to Monsieur Gustave, of course. </seg>
<seg id="640"> The magician, named after Schloss Lutz, the factories that produced weapons, medicines and fabrics, an important trade union newspaper, and perhaps the establishment, the Grand Budapest Hotel, has already arrived. </seg>
<seg id="641"> He named me his successor, and for the duration of the war I served my dormant dormitory behind the desk still in the room next to him. </seg>
<seg id="642"> It was just like her friends: insecure, vanity, superficial, blond, needing attention. In the end it was also rich. </seg>
<seg id="643"> But he did not succeed in becoming deceased. </seg>
<seg id="644"> Dear friends, we are here together ... </seg>
<seg id="645"> Neither did my dear Agatha. </seg>
<seg id="646"> You and our baby would be killed two years later by Prussian influence. A disease from nowhere. </seg>
<seg id="647"> Today we care about it in a week, but at that time millions of victims died. </seg>
<seg id="648"> On the morning of the 21st day of employment, Zubrowka's independent state officially ceased to exist. We moved to Lutz with Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="649"> Anyway, to answer your first question, of course. </seg>
<seg id="650"> Zero asked me about my humble origins in the hotel industry. I've been, for a period considered, the best Lobby Boy I've ever worked at Grand Budapest. </seg>
<seg id="651"> I think I can say that. </seg>
<seg id="652"> This one has finally overtaken me. </seg>
<seg id="653"> Although, I must say, he had an outstanding master. </seg>
<seg id="654"> Very true. </seg>
<seg id="655"> "Where do these two light-hearted flames," joined for a moment, "in the melting of the stratosphere of our star-shaped twigs, proceed? </seg>
<seg id="656"> "One from the east, the other from west." </seg>
<seg id="657"> Very well. </seg>
<seg id="658"> Do not try it with her. </seg>
<seg id="659"> Why are we still standing on a barley field? </seg>
<seg id="660"> I find these black uniforms rather slimy. </seg>
<seg id="661"> Well, hello, people. We talked just about you. </seg>
<seg id="662"> - Documents. - With pleasure, as always. </seg>
<seg id="663"> You are the first member of death squads to which I am officially presented. </seg>
<seg id="664"> How do you go? </seg>
<seg id="665"> Plus what change, am I saying good? [The French saying: the more you change the more you stay the same] It is a residence permit with the status of third-party employee, my dear, </seg>
<seg id="666"> Read this. </seg>
<seg id="667"> - Bait. - Stay there. </seg>
<seg id="668"> I'll give you my word, if he touches this man with a finger, I'll see her dismissed with disgrace, bound to the fence and hanged before sunset. </seg>
<seg id="669"> There are still dull glories of civilization in this wild slaughterhouse we call humanity. Damned, Dirty, Disgusting Fascist beasts! </seg>
<seg id="670"> He was one of those. </seg>
<seg id="671"> What can I say more? </seg>
<seg id="672"> How's it over? </seg>
<seg id="673"> It's over when they shot him. </seg>
<seg id="674"> So everything went to me. </seg>
<seg id="675"> After dinner, we went to pick up the keys to our rooms, but Monsieur Jean was not in place. I guess he forgot about us. </seg>
<seg id="676"> Obviously, in recent years, properties such as the Grand Budapest have become, with very few exceptions, public goods. </seg>
<seg id="677"> Although the exact terms of the contract with the new government have never been made public, the outcome is obvious to all: Zero Moustafa has poured a huge fortune in exchange for a costly, unprofitable, decadent hotel. </seg>
<seg id="678"> Because? </seg>
<seg id="679"> A mere matter of sentimentality? </seg>
<seg id="680"> It was not from me, it was not at all, but I felt I had to know, For my health, I believe. </seg>
<seg id="681"> Forgive me if I asked her. I hope I have not offended her. </seg>
<seg id="682"> Of course not. </seg>
<seg id="683"> Is that the last link with that vanished world? His world, if he wants to? </seg>
<seg id="684"> His world? </seg>
<seg id="685"> No I do not think so. </seg>
<seg id="686"> See, we already shared a vocation. It would not have been necessary. </seg>
<seg id="687"> No, I kept the hotel for Agatha. </seg>
<seg id="688"> We were happy here. </seg>
<seg id="689"> For a while'. </seg>
<seg id="690"> To be honest, I think his world has vanished long before he came in. </seg>
<seg id="691"> But, I must say, has certainly extended the illusion with infinite grace. </seg>
<seg id="692"> - Salt? - No, I'll sit here for a while. </seg>
<seg id="693"> Goodnight, then. </seg>
<seg id="694"> The following week, I went to take care of South America and started a long wandering abroad. </seg>
<seg id="695"> I did not return to Europe for many years. </seg>
<seg id="696"> It was a lovely old ruin. </seg>

<doc docid="pillow" genre="subtitles" sysid="sys">
<seg id="1"> It was the day of my 4th birthday while my aunt read Six Shonagon </seg>
<seg id="2"> that I saw my father and his publisher together for the first time. </seg>
<seg id="3"> To clearly understand what I had witnessed </seg>
<seg id="4"> I should have expected to be much bigger. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On the day of my 6th birthday, in the Matsuo Tiasha temple in Kyoto, </seg>
<seg id="6"> encouraged by my aunt, I solemnly promised that I would keep an intimate diary. My Pillow Book. </seg>
<seg id="7"> I would have filled him with all sorts of remarks, like Six Shonagon. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And maybe one day, like her, I could fill it with stories about all my lovers. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The same day I started to keep my intimate diary, </seg>
<seg id="10"> I met my future groom for the first time. </seg>
<seg id="11"> I was 6 and he was 10. </seg>
<seg id="12"> We did not exchange a word. </seg>
<seg id="13"> It had been carefully chosen by my father's publisher. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Like Six Shonagon, my sense of smell was very developed. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The smell of every kind of paper delighted me. </seg>
<seg id="16"> He reminded me of the perfume of the skin. </seg>
<seg id="17"> My mother had taught me Mandarin language. </seg>
<seg id="18"> When my father, on my birthday, painted a Japanese wish for her face, she made her favorite Chinese disc play. </seg>
<seg id="19"> She had been in vogue when my parents met in Shanghai. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In memory of my father and in memory of Six Shonagon, I was determined to find lovers </seg>
<seg id="21"> to remind me of the pleasures of calligraphy. </seg>
<seg id="22"> I could not be sure of what was most important: </seg>
<seg id="23"> a mediocre calligrapher who was a good lover </seg>
<seg id="24"> or an exceptional lover that was a bad calligraphy. </seg>
<seg id="25"> I become a wife. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I got married. </seg>
<seg id="27"> I had a husband. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Anyway, it was supposed to end badly. </seg>
<seg id="29"> My was a solemn wedding in perfect style. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Separated by my parents and my aunt, </seg>
<seg id="31"> I was always more and more confident with my diary. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Like Six Shonagon, he was full of remarks. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But my, unlike her, were all negative. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It was the first fire. </seg>
<seg id="35"> There would be a second. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Both marked a big change in my life. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Just arrived in Hong Kong and hid myself. </seg>
<seg id="38"> I lived in Kowloon City, in the nicest furnished rooms I could find. </seg>
<seg id="39"> I did not want my parents or my husband to find me. </seg>
<seg id="40"> I tried to improve the Chinese that my mother had taught me. </seg>
<seg id="41"> At the same time, I was determined to keep my father's traditions alive. </seg>
<seg id="42"> And my day </seg>
<seg id="43"> I tried to give my father's blessing on my own. </seg>
<seg id="44"> I found work in the offices of a Japanese designer. </seg>
<seg id="45"> I was determined to learn to speak without my emphasis on origin </seg>
<seg id="46"> and I dreamed of going to California. </seg>
<seg id="47">  </seg>
<seg id="48">  </seg>
<seg id="49"> Yeah, with a thick sleeve. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Pink tulle type </seg>
<seg id="51"> We went to Kyoto, back to Japan, to work in the temple of Matsuo Tiasha, of whom Six Shonagon had been a frequent attendant. </seg>
<seg id="52"> I could not give up such an occasion. </seg>
<seg id="53"> I felt a bit of nostalgia for my land. </seg>
<seg id="54"> I continued to walk on the catwalk until late at night until the last spectators were gone. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Six Shonagon had admired the moon rising in that garden 1000 years earlier. </seg>
<seg id="56"> I could continue to go on and on, on and off ... all night. </seg>
<seg id="57"> You are not in the condition of preaching an irreproachable life. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Oh sÃ ¬, so! I could write it with blood! </seg>
<seg id="59"> Why do not you join us? </seg>
<seg id="60"> No, I'm too beautiful and too rich. </seg>
<seg id="61"> - What's the matter with the wealth? - I think so much. </seg>
<seg id="62"> I could draw the cloth and wear it. </seg>
<seg id="63"> Just to terrorize customers. </seg>
<seg id="64"> So you will not be rich. </seg>
<seg id="65"> And then you could not afford to pay me. Well, but you will not be paid. - You'll have to work for nothing. - Ah sÃ¬? What would you do for free? </seg>
<seg id="66"> I would be willing to waste my talent on your body. </seg>
<seg id="67"> - In exchange for very little. - No! </seg>
<seg id="68"> My quest for the ideal calligraphic lover continued. </seg>
<seg id="69"> But it was less and less likely I could find it. </seg>
<seg id="70"> If they were old, they could not take any advantage from what I had to offer. </seg>
<seg id="71"> And if they were young, they often distracted easily. </seg>
<seg id="72"> And yes! Are they! </seg>
<seg id="73"> - Do not look! - I do not watch. </seg>
<seg id="74"> What are you doing here? Are you the manager, huh? </seg>
<seg id="75"> Shut up! - What do you think you're doing? - Shut up! </seg>
<seg id="76"> They were just the boys they played. </seg>
<seg id="77"> To find me they used Hoki, the photographer of the Kyoto parade, like a pawn. </seg>
<seg id="78"> I want those photographs! </seg>
<seg id="79"> Once I had kissed her on the cheek in a moment of happiness. </seg>
<seg id="80"> You're a vermouth! I apologize, I followed you from Japan. </seg>
<seg id="81"> I've followed you everywhere. This is obvious. I can help you. Well, so far you have not done much! </seg>
<seg id="82"> You're so beautiful! </seg>
<seg id="83"> Taken to my slopes a calligrapher with obsession for math. </seg>
<seg id="84"> As his wife waited in the kitchen singing, that accountant filled me with the back of the additions and the chest of subtractions. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Then I met the chart of a magazine </seg>
<seg id="86"> who insisted on why I visited her home in the New Territories. Actually he just wanted to get caught up because his parents wanted grandchildren. </seg>
<seg id="87"> - He writes: "Dear Nagiko." - Thing? </seg>
<seg id="88"> - Sometimes I was risking. - But where...? </seg>
<seg id="89"> - Here. - I can not! </seg>
<seg id="90"> You can. In the casualty there is often a surprise. </seg>
<seg id="91"> "Cara Nagiko"? </seg>
<seg id="92"> Some of the great Japanese calligraphers were very shy men and extreme modesty. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Humble daytime scribes, daring poets at night. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Very well. Now write something else here. Though trepidation, I tried to get away from what I knew best. </seg>
<seg id="95"> After all, there were other great calligraphic traditions. </seg>
<seg id="96"> What did you write? It's up to you to find out. Yeah, but why and why? </seg>
<seg id="97"> Nagiko, certain cultures forbid the images. </seg>
<seg id="98"> While others might have to forbid writing. </seg>
<seg id="99"> I need writing. </seg>
<seg id="100"> Do not ask me why. Pull out your pen and ... </seg>
<seg id="101"> Please write your name here. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Courage. </seg>
<seg id="103"> One night I met an Englishman at CaffÃ¨ Typo, a translator. </seg>
<seg id="104"> He said to speak 4 languages, including Yiddish. </seg>
<seg id="105"> Give you another chance. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Write me on my back. </seg>
<seg id="107"> But ... what do I have to write? </seg>
<seg id="108"> Write ... </seg>
<seg id="109"> "We met at CaffÃ¨ Typo." </seg>
<seg id="110"> I write it in 3 languages. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Japanese, French and another one of your choice. </seg>
<seg id="112"> Waitress! </seg>
<seg id="113"> Do you want me to write again? </seg>
<seg id="114"> It can be. </seg>
<seg id="115"> I can not understand your smell. Use a scent. And then your fingers ... What's wrong with my fingers? </seg>
<seg id="116"> I'll give you another chance. The last. </seg>
<seg id="117"> Write me on my breast. Well, I do not know if it's the case ... </seg>
<seg id="118"> What? I decide whether it is the case or not! </seg>
<seg id="119"> Write in yiddish! How do you say breast in yiddish? </seg>
<seg id="120"> If you are a writer, you can write anywhere. </seg>
<seg id="121"> It is not a great performance. </seg>
<seg id="122"> You are not a writer. </seg>
<seg id="123"> This is not writing, it is scribbling. </seg>
<seg id="124"> It's just a scribble. </seg>
<seg id="125"> Get out! </seg>
<seg id="126"> You are not a writer. You're a scribble! </seg>
<seg id="127"> I've watched you with your small typewriter by clicking-clac. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Get out! Get lost! </seg>
<seg id="129"> Teach me. </seg>
<seg id="130"> - Power. - No! Seriously? </seg>
<seg id="131"> What pleasure can I make writing about you? </seg>
<seg id="132"> - You have to write about me! - Forward. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Use my body as the pages of a book. </seg>
<seg id="134"> Of your book. </seg>
<seg id="135"> An instrument of writing nothing at all extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id="136"> I started thinking about experimental processing </seg>
<seg id="137"> of the Six Shonagon Anatomical Comparison List. </seg>
<seg id="138"> The ideas were often her but the words were just mine. </seg>
<seg id="139"> For my first writing experiment on the flesh, I made an agreement with an Englishman for whom even the simplest ideogram was a sign of no sense. </seg>
<seg id="140"> Hockey, if you care about my interests, it's time to prove it to me. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Come now. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Up, get to work and do your best. But I will not pay you, you're still in debt. </seg>
<seg id="143"> From now on I will write. </seg>
<seg id="144"> From now on the pen will be the pen and not the simple card. </seg>
<seg id="145"> I could be useful to you. </seg>
<seg id="146"> I do not think so. </seg>
<seg id="147"> Why? What am I supposed to do? </seg>
<seg id="148"> Because you're in Kyoto and you're young. </seg>
<seg id="149"> And you have an illegible writing. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Also your skin as a card is not worth much. </seg>
<seg id="151"> He's gonna see. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Did you see? Do you know how I nicknamed you in my diary? </seg>
<seg id="153"> Sponge skin. </seg>
<seg id="154"> But I could help you. </seg>
<seg id="155"> I do not think it's appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="157"> You're not very clever in complimenting. </seg>

<seg id="159"> Come on, let me try. </seg>
<seg id="160"> Hoki will go out at dawn to go to Kowloon City on a busy street where they will deliver the pack to a salesman. </seg>
<seg id="161"> "We do not think the conditions for publishing your material exist, and it is not worth the paper on which it is written." </seg>
<seg id="162"> They also despise the quality of the paper. </seg>
<seg id="163"> Maybe it's not quite Japanese. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Use me, try to write to me. </seg>
<seg id="165"> Seduction of a man ... </seg>
<seg id="166"> I met Jerome at CaffÃ¨ Typo and asked him for his performance as a translator. </seg>
<seg id="167"> I will offer you the choice between 6 languages. </seg>
<seg id="168"> She had learned two more. </seg>
<seg id="169"> I talked to him for a long time, worshiping him. </seg>
<seg id="170"> Showing admiration for all the books he still had to write. </seg>
<seg id="171"> You have to sign here. </seg>
<seg id="172"> Our first report was strictly financial. </seg>
<seg id="173"> He wanted to pay the bill but did not have any money. </seg>
<seg id="174"> He offered to sign a check but he did not have the booklet. </seg>
<seg id="175"> I offered him the palm of my hand. </seg>
<seg id="176"> I could not seduce the publisher. But maybe I could seduce her lover. </seg>
<seg id="177"> His writing in so many languages ​​turned me into a living stele pointing to the east, west, north, and south. </seg>
<seg id="178"> I had German shoes, French socks, Jewish gloves, a hat with Russian vests. </seg>
<seg id="179"> The only points I did not write about were those I covered with the garments. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Stay silent, get out! Get lost! </seg>
<seg id="181"> I would like to honor my writer. </seg>
<seg id="182"> I could help you. </seg>
<seg id="183"> I could learn other languages. </seg>
<seg id="184"> So you could read them all over the world. </seg>
<seg id="185"> When God created the first human being, he painted on his eyes, lips and sex. </seg>
<seg id="186"> And when God was pleased with his creation, he was obliged to sign it with his name. </seg>
<seg id="187"> There are so many publishers in the world, because he is? </seg>
<seg id="188"> I have my good reasons. </seg>
<seg id="189"> I suspect it's because it has cleared you so abruptly and a few people, maybe none, never did. </seg>
<seg id="190"> It can be. </seg>
<seg id="191"> If you are so determined to get published by him, a publisher who does not consider you, and who loves me, then I have an idea. </seg>
<seg id="192"> I could make you a messenger. You could write about me. </seg>
<seg id="193"> And with your permission and your blessing, I could ... Go visit your friend publisher. </seg>
<seg id="194"> What an abnegation! </seg>
<seg id="195"> But I'm sure you will not enjoy it, do not you think so? </seg>
<seg id="196"> It can be. </seg>
<seg id="197"> Would you be jealous? </seg>
<seg id="198"> They went and copied everything. He's waiting for me. </seg>
<seg id="199"> He is thinking of an altogether </seg>
<seg id="200"> You'll do them, do not you? </seg>
<seg id="201"> - See you tonight, here in front of you. - Hey! </seg>
<seg id="202"> You are taking too much taste. </seg>
<seg id="203"> But I have your permission. And then it's just editorial needs. </seg>
<seg id="204"> If you do not mind, I'll look for someone else. </seg>
<seg id="205"> Try it. </seg>
<seg id="206"> He dared let me wait. Buy the other card. </seg>
<seg id="207"> Do not get angry. Why do not you use me? </seg>
<seg id="208"> Still two of these and brings something for him too. </seg>
<seg id="209"> She could scare a son! </seg>
<seg id="210"> Nothing wrong, huh? I need human skin. - 2 and a half feet. </seg>
<seg id="211"> - You are welcome? Front and back. </seg>
<seg id="212"> I could give you three and a half! </seg>
<seg id="213"> I believe it. Only my controversial publisher is very demanding regarding the quality of the paper. </seg>
<seg id="214"> Jerome! </seg>
<seg id="215"> Jerome! </seg>
<seg id="216"> Serve me both. Come with me? </seg>
<seg id="217"> Come on, let's go! You're fabulous! </seg>
<seg id="218"> One bet, I swear to God! </seg>
<seg id="219"> Do you know what? </seg>
<seg id="220"> There's a song about you in America, do you know how it's called? </seg>
<seg id="221"> It is called "Ice cream"! </seg>
<seg id="222"> The lady said that I ... </seg>
<seg id="223"> Ready? Pull out one foot, pull the other out! Then make a twist. I'm thirsty so much! But you lick the gelatin, lick the jelly! </seg>
<seg id="224"> - Hi dear. - Nagiko! </seg>
<seg id="225"> Americans always say they have nothing to hide. </seg>
<seg id="226"> And apparently it is true! </seg>
<seg id="227"> What's this stuff? What kind of printed cabbage? </seg>
<seg id="228"> This is a menu! </seg>
<seg id="229"> Nagiko! </seg>
<seg id="230"> I know you're there, let me in! </seg>
<seg id="231"> Do not play, I know you are there! </seg>
<seg id="232"> Nagiko! </seg>
<seg id="233"> I saw your friend. Your friend cries. </seg>
<seg id="234"> She was really cute, pretty cute ... </seg>
<seg id="235"> It was covered by my ink. That ink was for my body. </seg>
<seg id="236"> Nagiko! What have I done? What have I done? </seg>
<seg id="237"> Nagiko, let me in. </seg>
<seg id="238"> I love you, Nagiko! </seg>
<seg id="239"> I love you, speak to me! </seg>
<seg id="240"> Nagiko! </seg>
<seg id="241"> Please! </seg>
<seg id="242"> I'm not playing! </seg>
<seg id="243"> Let me in! Let me in! </seg>
<seg id="244"> Why do not you want to talk to me? </seg>
<seg id="245"> I do not know. </seg>
<seg id="246"> How do you not know? When did you last see it? </seg>
<seg id="247"> Whiskey. </seg>
<seg id="248"> Whiskey. </seg>
<seg id="249"> She comes here just to choose, look for her customers. </seg>
<seg id="250"> She comes here, she turns and chooses. </seg>
<seg id="251"> All the waiters make them ruffian. </seg>
<seg id="252"> They point to customers who have very smooth skin. </seg>
<seg id="253"> Even in the middle of the legs. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Then her waitress washed them long with lemon juice to make their skin soft and smooth. </seg>
<seg id="255"> But you can scare her. </seg>
<seg id="256"> You are a writer. </seg>
<seg id="257"> Do you remember Juliet and Romeo? </seg>
<seg id="258"> Shakespeare. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Jerome! </seg>
<seg id="260"> Jerome, I apologize. </seg>
<seg id="261"> Let's start over as if nothing had happened. </seg>
<seg id="262"> I was furious, you deceived me. </seg>
<seg id="263"> Just with the man I hate, the man who reared my father. </seg>
<seg id="264"> But we can avenge him. </seg>
<seg id="265"> But we have to work. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Jerome! </seg>
<seg id="267"> Jerome! </seg>
<seg id="268"> He had always wanted to be a stranger. Although not necessarily Oriental. </seg>
<seg id="269"> Our culture was tight to him. </seg>
<seg id="270"> But he would never have become a writer. </seg>
<seg id="271"> He did not have enough imagination. </seg>
<seg id="272"> Jerome was dyslexic up to 12 years before the thing became fashionable. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He smashed all the pairs of glasses I was giving him. </seg>
<seg id="274"> She hated wearing glasses. </seg>
<seg id="275"> But it was great to break things up. </seg>
<seg id="276"> Especially the relationships, like her father. </seg>
<seg id="277"> His father was a converted Catholic. Always with the anxiety of experiencing her faith. </seg>
<seg id="278"> The first child we called Paul, the second Jerome by the name of his father's confessor, a Jesuit who lived in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="279"> Jerome never liked me. </seg>
<seg id="280"> She preferred my sister. An insolent wandering guy who was crazy about modern literature, obscenities, blasphemies, and scatology before they became fashionable. </seg>
<seg id="281"> I've heard that she is also fashionable. </seg>
<seg id="282"> I guess it was to excite Jerome. </seg>
<seg id="283"> We burned an echo of Jerome's car but not his books. </seg>
<seg id="284"> They were too moist. </seg>
<seg id="285"> I burned my books, my clothes, shoes, photos, and diaries. </seg>
<seg id="286"> It was the second great fire in my life. </seg>
<seg id="287"> The first had left me from Japan. The second made me come back. </seg>
<seg id="288"> Hoki wrote to me. </seg>
<seg id="289"> Even after Jerome's death he continued to be very jealous. </seg>
<seg id="290"> He had written to inform me about the publisher's sacred act. </seg>
<seg id="291"> I had promised 13 books to Jerome. </seg>
<seg id="292"> Since I could not write it on her body, </seg>
<seg id="293"> I found substitutes in Japan. </seg>
<seg id="294"> I would have written the books for the publisher in return for the return of the intimate diary in which he had transformed Jerome's body. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Now that you've been signed, do it and do what I told you. </seg>
<seg id="296"> Excuse me, can I see the director? </seg>
<seg id="297"> Let's take another picture. </seg>
<seg id="298"> Sorry, from the manager and tell him we are here. </seg>
<seg id="299"> This is what Nagiko Yoshikino writes: </seg>
<seg id="300"> "I know for sure that she has blackmailed, offended, humiliated, raped my father. </seg>
<seg id="301"> I suspect, too, that she is the cause of my husband's ruin. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Now he has committed the greatest crime. </seg>
<seg id="303"> He profaned my lover's body. </seg>
<seg id="304"> Now we both know that she has lived enough. " </seg>
<seg id="305"> Today I'm 28 years old. </seg>
<seg id="306"> It's my birthday and I already have enough experience writing my intimate diary. </seg>
<seg id="307"> Think of Nagiko Kiyohara's "Pillow Book". </seg>
<seg id="308"> Now I can draw up a list of things that speed up the heartbeats. </seg>
</doc>
<doc docid="pure" genre="subtitles" sysid="sys">
<seg id="1"> It will take a bad pneumonia! </seg>
<seg id="2"> Favor your documents. </seg>
<seg id="3"> I have not got them. </seg>
<seg id="4"> They will leave you ... </seg>
<seg id="5"> Just a bad pneumonia. </seg>
<seg id="6"> So it will be colder. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Do I have to wait a long time in this slum? Do I need to muddle? </seg>
<seg id="8"> Quiet. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The commissioner has been warned. </seg>
<seg id="10"> It's on the street. </seg>
<seg id="11"> At least she's dry. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It hurts me as well! </seg>
<seg id="13"> Does it seem to be in an American movie when you read my rights? </seg>
<seg id="14"> If he wants, he can take off his shoes. </seg>
<seg id="15"> I got dressed. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It happens from time to time when it is old. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Is not it true? </seg>
<seg id="18"> I have to call! </seg>
<seg id="19"> I'm sorry, I can not. </seg>
<seg id="20"> How would not it be possible? I have to warn that she'll be late. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Now you can not, do not insist. </seg>
<seg id="22"> I will ask the Commissioner when he arrives. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Otherwise, if I ask the Commissioner! We can swear! I'll tell him how I was dealing with you. Will pass very serious trouble, I'm not a stranger I! </seg>
<seg id="24"> Anyone you know is not special treatments here. </seg>
<seg id="25"> If you put him in the head! </seg>
<seg id="26"> Tell the Commissioner what he wants. </seg>
<seg id="27"> But who will ever be! Can you tell me what time it is or should I wait for Humprey Bogart? </seg>
<seg id="28"> It's 21.15. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Oh shit! ÃƒÆ ... late! </seg>
<seg id="30"> Do you want to stop it with this unbearable litany? - Come on! </seg>
<seg id="31"> And be silent! </seg>
<seg id="32"> Sorry, sorry ... </seg>
<seg id="33"> I'll have an important appointment tomorrow morning. Very. </seg>
<seg id="34"> With the Minister of Culture. </seg>
<seg id="35"> I should prepare myself, I can not miss it. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The commissioner is coming. </seg>
<seg id="37"> - Can I have a cigarette? Find a cigarette. </seg>
<seg id="38"> - Captain, I've never smoked. - Not even! </seg>
<seg id="39"> The Commissioner smokes, I hope. </seg>
<seg id="40"> A commissar always smokes. </seg>
<seg id="41"> A commissioner smokes the pipe, chews a cigar. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Drink this, will do you good. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Come on! </seg>
<seg id="44"> Drink, it's hot. </seg>
<seg id="45"> - ÃƒÂ † latte. - Yeah, it's hot milk. </seg>
<seg id="46"> It's good for you. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Drink. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Drink! </seg>
<seg id="49"> Piece of shit! </seg>
<seg id="50"> But what he does! Marshal! Stop! Stop! </seg>
<seg id="51"> Bad deal. </seg>
<seg id="52"> He did not want it. </seg>
<seg id="53"> With a timing so I would have preferred to stay under the blankets. </seg>
<seg id="54"> You are waking up. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Try to get up. </seg>
<seg id="56"> - Give it a hand. - I'm alone, let me. Let. </seg>
<seg id="57"> I guess she is the commissar. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Excellent supposition. </seg>
<seg id="59"> You have many explanations, Commissioner. </seg>
<seg id="60"> By what authority have his agents practically confiscated me ... ... they have prevented me from communicating with my family ... ... and they have patted me like an animal? </seg>
<seg id="61"> She answers me. </seg>
<seg id="62"> I did three simple questions. </seg>
<seg id="63"> Usually I ask questions here. </seg>
<seg id="64"> I know he's in charge of the accident, but I'm sorry for the controversy. </seg>
<seg id="65"> - I'm usually punctual ... - I miss her punctuality! </seg>
<seg id="66"> I do not feel the desire to make her acquaintance. </seg>
<seg id="67"> I want to know why I'm here. </seg>
<seg id="68"> You will enjoy your curiosity. </seg>
<seg id="69"> Come on. But if you let me know who I'm dealing with ... ... since it goes out in the open countryside in the evening ... ... in the middle of the flood without waterproof and without documents! It does not seem to me a crime or a crime to be without documents. </seg>
<seg id="70"> - They'll leave them in the wallet or on the desk ... - I'm sure. - Or in another jacket. - Of course. </seg>
<seg id="71"> But who do I enjoy talking about? </seg>
<seg id="72"> With a truck driver, a boxer, a dentist, an astrologer ... ... or a magistrate as he knows how to distinguish a crime from a crime? </seg>
<seg id="73"> Once people recognized me before I opened my mouth to say hello ... ... but it's not my habit to make me celebrity shield. Anyway ... ... my name is Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="74"> And my name is Leonardo Da Vinci. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Do not you believe me, Commissioner? </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is her right. </seg>
<seg id="77"> But what maybe it is not his right to stop people ... ... just because he's in the rain. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Do you mind so much rain, Mr. Leonardo Da Vinci? </seg>
<seg id="79"> I'm Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="80"> If you do not believe me, look for my documents. </seg>
<seg id="81"> It's your job, is not it? </seg>
<seg id="82"> I live in the farmhouse, they will be at the studio or on the table in the kitchen ... ... or in my jacket or bed. </seg>
<seg id="83"> "It still happens to me to doubt that I have lived those days ..." "... to have held that friendship ..." "... to have known who had just fallen under my eyes." </seg>
<seg id="84"> "This body was breathing and I wrote these pages." </seg>
<seg id="85"> "In his empty eyes he needed a look ..." "... to his lips a last lament ..." "... to this dream needed a sleeper." </seg>
<seg id="86"> Congratulations, his rhino is very interesting and well-written ... ... but he does not enjoy me at all and I do not understand what that means. </seg>
<seg id="87"> What she calls rhymes is a quotation from a novel ... ... whose author is called Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="88"> You're just unlucky ... ... because when you live in a place where nothing happens ... ... you have a lot of time to read and I read a lot. </seg>
<seg id="89"> Whole days, whole weeks ... Books on books, books on books ... </seg>
<seg id="90"> You can not imagine how many and I happen to read more ... ... the ones I like the most. </seg>
<seg id="91"> "The Palace of the Nine Borders", "Steps," "Hate," "Geometry," "Treatments of Pleasures," "Nero," "The Three Torches" ... all of Onoff's works, my favorite writer ... ... in my humble opinion, the greatest. </seg>
<seg id="92"> I'm just worried that it has fallen badly. </seg>
<seg id="93"> I know Onoff's biography as my slippers. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Walking at night during a thunderstorm is not serious in sÃƒÂ ©. </seg>
<seg id="95"> Forget the identity card in another jacket is just stupid ... ... but trying to escape a lockout ... ... then attacking the agents is even more risky. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Doing all these things together within a few hours ... ... declaring a false identity ... ... it's very dangerous. </seg>
<seg id="97"> Bryan. </seg>
<seg id="98"> - When you want, Commissioner. - We will not have that much. - Who was winning? - It's 45 points ... ... but the guy took the shangai. The shangai is not worth a hand that I never tremble. Prepare me a coffee. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Get up. </seg>
<seg id="100"> What's your name? </seg>
<seg id="101"> Do not throw it for long, its name. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Tell me his name. </seg>
<seg id="103"> Tell me his name, for God! </seg>
<seg id="104"> "I was near the closet ..." "... when Mrs. Doneras's car went into the yard." </seg>
<seg id="105"> "The maid will rush to keep the door open." "The salut." "Then ran before her." </seg>
<seg id="106"> "The lady will slowly step up my bowl." </seg>
<seg id="107"> "She was beautiful." </seg>
<seg id="108"> "From the pocket of the skirt pull out a piece of cooked fish ..." "... and it will begin to eat it." </seg>
<seg id="109"> "She was eating in front of herself without seeing anything." </seg>
<seg id="110"> "When the lady arrives, he shuts away from the closet ..." "... and advances to her but the lady does not look at her." </seg>
<seg id="111"> "He passes by, one centimeter, as it did not exist." </seg>
<seg id="112"> The Lady... </seg>
<seg id="113"> A piece of herring in the skirt pocket. </seg>
<seg id="114"> These are the "Steps" ... ... when Mrs. Doneras wants to leave. </seg>
<seg id="115"> - It's halfway through the book. - Not the "steps". </seg>
<seg id="116"> "The Steps," Commissioner. </seg>
<seg id="117"> "The stairs", third chapter. </seg>
<seg id="118"> The return of Druso. </seg>
<seg id="119"> To declare a false identity is dangerous, Leonardo Da Vinci. </seg>
<seg id="120"> Prince Cosimo's speech before putting majolics down. </seg>
<seg id="121"> "That's why I've been here since ..." "... and that this park is populated with kneeling men ..." "and fallen dancers." </seg>
<seg id="122"> "And so that at the corners of frescoes and walls ..." "... we see crouching figures defecating in the shadows." </seg>
<seg id="123"> Is it right? </seg>
<seg id="124"> She tells me to know my biography in memory. </seg>
<seg id="125"> I'm 48, I wrote essays, novels, songs ... ... articles and plays. </seg>
<seg id="126"> The last one, "Nero", I have directed it badly. </seg>
<seg id="127"> Not more than six years old. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Just enough? </seg>
<seg id="129"> Onoff! </seg>
<seg id="130"> The Great Onoff! </seg>
<seg id="131"> The great Onoff here! How could I not recognize it? </seg>
<seg id="132"> I do not know how to pardon me. Let me shake her hand. </seg>
<seg id="133"> I'm appalled by the unworthy way in which we have welcomed it. </seg>
<seg id="134"> - It is not a case of a tragedy. - But she's all wet. </seg>
<seg id="135"> Soon, dry towels and clothes! And even shoes, quick! </seg>
<seg id="136"> Do you want a cafe? </seg>
<seg id="137"> - Another cafe. </seg>
<seg id="138"> - All right. - May I call, please? - Of course. Only ... we see ... The lines are busy. </seg>
<seg id="139"> But how could I not recognize it? </seg>
<seg id="140"> Yet his face will be seen at least a thousand times. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Photos, television deform everything. </seg>
<seg id="142"> - They hide their faces instead of showing them. - Very true! </seg>
<seg id="143"> What makes a character like you do here? </seg>
<seg id="144"> - I have a cottage in the mountains, near the river. - Women, huh? </seg>
<seg id="145"> - If you like to think it. - Forgive the indiscretion. - I did not want to intrude, excuse me. - Unfortunately I rarely get there. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Only to work in peace, just to concentrate. </seg>
<seg id="147"> Are you writing a new book? </seg>
<seg id="148"> - Tell me I guessed. - More or less guessed. </seg>
<seg id="149"> It's been here for a long time? </seg>
<seg id="150"> I arrived Thursday, today is Sunday ... four days! </seg>
<seg id="151"> The beard! How did I not understand it before? </seg>
<seg id="152"> She always brought her beard! That's why I did not recognize it! </seg>
<seg id="153"> The cafÃ¨, Commissioner. </seg>
<seg id="154"> I brought her shoes. - Can you open please? - Yeah, sure. Arrival. </seg>
<seg id="155"> They are the gardener's boots. </seg>
<seg id="156"> - They will go wide but they are dry. - No matter, thank you. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Forgive me a while ago. How's your hand going? </seg>
<seg id="158"> Do not take it, it will survive. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Thanks for the boots. </seg>
<seg id="160"> Thank you for your indulgence towards my work. </seg>
<seg id="161"> It is I who have to thank her. </seg>
<seg id="162"> I can not imagine how happy she was to meet her ... ... that she could shake her hand that created the worlds ... ... in which I loved living. </seg>
<seg id="163"> I would not abuse her courtesy but if she could accompany me ... </seg>
<seg id="164"> - Of course. - So she'll be able to give you back the uniform and boots. </seg>
<seg id="165"> Master, I'm very embarrassed, I do not know how to tell her. </seg>
<seg id="166"> Documents? They will also have them. </seg>
<seg id="167"> This is not the point. </seg>
<seg id="168"> - What else is there then? - Nothing serious, I assure you. </seg>
<seg id="169"> I would like to stay a little longer. </seg>
<seg id="170"> Okay, if you think it's necessary ... It's nothing serious, just a formality. </seg>
<seg id="171"> - I will not take too long. - I should be grateful, I'm tired. </seg>
<seg id="172"> But she has to call! </seg>
<seg id="173"> Give me the number, let me call you. </seg>
<seg id="174"> ... 3396. Easy to repeat. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Is his house number? </seg>
<seg id="176"> No, my friend answers. </seg>
<seg id="177"> Pass this number on the direct ... ... 93633396. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Could I know what he's dealing with his new book? </seg>
<seg id="179"> You will not want to give me an interview, I hope. </seg>
<seg id="180"> If he knows me well as he says, I will never release it. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Of course, I know, even though I never understood why. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Interviews are always useless. </seg>
<seg id="183"> One comes to you to hear what he knows ... ... for the pleasure of hearing you repeat. Is not it ridiculous? - In a way, yes. </seg>
<seg id="184"> But it is not my case. </seg>
<seg id="185"> I want you to tell me everything he did on the day today ... ... and I assure you I do not know. </seg>
<seg id="186"> AlIora is not an interview, it's just an interrogation. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Call it as you please, but please help me. </seg>
<seg id="188"> It's not easy for me to ask certain things to a man I think. - Then do not ask me. - I have to do it, Mr. Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="189"> I have to do it in her interest. </seg>
<seg id="190"> As you can see we are alone, we will not get verbal drafts. </seg>
<seg id="191"> Tell me exactly how his day went. Eventually, they will accompany you and leave you in peace. </seg>
<seg id="192"> - Do not you have a cigarette? - No one here smokes. </seg>
<seg id="193"> Let it go, it does not do anything. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Smoke a lot? </seg>
<seg id="195"> Three packages a day, last time even more. </seg>
<seg id="196"> - And today? - Today I must have pulverized my record. </seg>
<seg id="197"> - What time did you wake up this morning? - Under 3.30. </seg>
<seg id="198"> - How is it so precise? - I wake up every day at 3:30. I do not sleep a lot. An hour, an hour and a half, never more than two. It will be ten years old that I always wake up at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="199"> - As the protagonist of "Geometry"! - As the protagonist of "Geometry". </seg>
<seg id="200"> - It's a craze! - It's true, I admit it. </seg>
<seg id="201"> I was surprised when he did not recognize my quote ... </seg>
<seg id="202"> ... "His lips needed a last lament." </seg>
<seg id="203"> Do you remember all the names of the people you suspect ... ... who arrested, interrogated, beaten in jail? </seg>
<seg id="204"> Remember their faces, hair color? Did you keep the memory of their words? I do not believe! </seg>
<seg id="205"> You can not remember everything. </seg>
<seg id="206"> The fragment you mentioned earlier ... could be derived from "The Palace of the Ninth Frontier." </seg>
<seg id="207"> But that's right! </seg>
<seg id="208"> It is the beginning of the last chapter. - Great! - We talked about insomnia. </seg>
<seg id="209"> I too suffered insomnia for many years. </seg>
<seg id="210"> I've tried all the medicines, the treatments, and the possible remedies. </seg>
<seg id="211"> Sleepers do not end! </seg>
<seg id="212"> No way. </seg>
<seg id="213"> Then a few years ago, suddenly, I'm completely cured. So, suddenly! </seg>
<seg id="214"> Do not despair, maybe it will happen to her. </seg>
<seg id="215"> I do not need sleeping or nursing. </seg>
<seg id="216"> I was in good health with insomnia. He is my best co-worker. It's just thanks to her that I work when everyone else sleeps. </seg>
<seg id="217"> - She also worked last night. - Less than usual. - Are you sleepy again? - No. </seg>
<seg id="218"> So what did he do? </seg>
<seg id="219"> I looked long at the ceiling and the ceiling looked long at me. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Alone. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Was he alone in bed? </seg>
<seg id="222"> She is an investigator of infinite delicacy. </seg>
<seg id="223"> - Yeah, I was alone. - Just ... continue. </seg>
<seg id="224"> I got up before she roared the cock. </seg>
<seg id="225"> I wore the dressing gown and slipped my slippers. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Then I went to the kitchen. </seg>
<seg id="227"> I caught a coffee in the company of a teaspoon of sugar. </seg>
<seg id="228"> Then I did the shit. </seg>
<seg id="229"> I scratched my head, washed it ... ... I dressed, I phoned ... ... then rewrote what I wrote yesterday ... ... and I took notes on what I'm going to write tomorrow . </seg>
<seg id="230"> So I took a walk. </seg>
<seg id="231"> After I got back home and I put in order the junk. </seg>
<seg id="232"> And then? </seg>
<seg id="233"> And then I went to the station to take my agent. </seg>
<seg id="234"> - How is your agent called? - Daniela. - Daniela come? </seg>
<seg id="235"> Daniela February. </seg>
<seg id="236"> He went to the station to take Daniela February. </seg>
<seg id="237"> - And then? - We had lunch and talked about work. </seg>
<seg id="238"> - In the afternoon I returned to the station. - At what time? </seg>
<seg id="239"> Between 17 and 18. </seg>
<seg id="240"> - She's playing and I'm home. - At what time? </seg>
<seg id="241"> - You will be the 19th. - And then? </seg>
<seg id="242"> - And then ... - And then ...? And then? </seg>
<seg id="243"> I do not remember very well. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Do not you remember very well? </seg>
<seg id="245"> I can not remember anything. </seg>
<seg id="246"> Can not remember? </seg>
<seg id="247"> He just left the station ... ... he's back home, I'm 19 ... </seg>
<seg id="248"> I can not remember more. - I do not remember ... I do not remember. - But it's absurd! </seg>
<seg id="249"> Do not you remember what he did just four hours ago? </seg>
<seg id="250"> - Does this look normal to you? - Is it a crime not to remember? </seg>
<seg id="251"> Do you want to tease me? </seg>
<seg id="252"> - She wants to get around! - He tired me! </seg>
<seg id="253"> What do you want me to do? What importance can it have? </seg>
<seg id="254"> - Why should I get her around? - Re-start, force! </seg>
<seg id="255"> Things change, dear Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="256"> I had the desire to help her. </seg>
<seg id="257"> I admire her and her works ... ... but as long as she does not agree with her memory ... </seg>
<seg id="258"> ... They will not come out of here. - I do not know what to do with his help. What do you suspect in his failed half-caste police headquarters? </seg>
<seg id="259"> Next, the name. </seg>
<seg id="260"> His name. </seg>
<seg id="261"> It's a very simple question, dear Onoff! </seg>
<seg id="262"> - I will not answer before he let me call. - Can not! </seg>
<seg id="263"> If you put it well in your head. </seg>
<seg id="264"> I can not deny the right to call my lawyer. </seg>
<seg id="265"> I will answer your questions only in the presence of my lawyer. </seg>
<seg id="266"> I know perfectly his rights. </seg>
<seg id="267"> But if you do nothing but deny it all! </seg>
<seg id="268"> First his guardian angels "I ask the Commissioner" ... ... then she "give me the number, let me call him on the direct." </seg>
<seg id="269"> Why can not I call from this police station? </seg>
<seg id="270"> The lines are broken, are you doing well so? </seg>
<seg id="271"> Throughout my life as a novelist ... - ... I have never breathed such an exuberance of imagination! - ÃƒÃ † la veritÃƒÂ. </seg>
<seg id="272"> When there is a thunderstorm, the phone lines always jump. Indeed, strange that the light has not gone yet. </seg>
<seg id="273"> - You could tell me before! - I'll give you my word. </seg>
<seg id="274"> When the lines are junctured, you will be the first to call. </seg>
<seg id="275"> - His name. - Why this interrogation? - His name, please! - Why this interrogation? </seg>
<seg id="276"> Tonight not far from his farmhouse was murdered. </seg>
<seg id="277"> Sit down, please. </seg>
<seg id="278"> In my opinion, the assassin has already found. </seg>
<seg id="279"> I do not even think I'm joking that she is a murderer ... ... but if you stubbornly say that she does not remember what she did tonight ... ... she will have to suspect that she is. </seg>
<seg id="280"> - His name! Respond! - My name is Onoff! </seg>
<seg id="281"> - Place and date of birth. - February 3, 1946, Auver-sur. </seg>
<seg id="282"> - Profession? - Writer. - is married? - Twice married. </seg>
<seg id="283"> - That means? - My first wife died shortly after our wedding. </seg>
<seg id="284"> - Under what circumstances? - Cancer. </seg>
<seg id="285"> - When did he get married? - I divorced nine years ago. </seg>
<seg id="286"> - Sons? - Nobody. </seg>
<seg id="287"> - Criminal record? - What do you want to know? How many times have I stolen at the supermarket? Or how many other murders I committed before tonight? </seg>
<seg id="288"> Denying to have criminal records. </seg>
<seg id="289"> - What did he come to do here? - I told you before. </seg>
<seg id="290"> I've reached my mountain cottage to concentrate, to work ... ... far from everyone ... ... far from the world, far from the police commissioners. </seg>
<seg id="291"> - Did she come to work alone? - Just a moment, Commissioner. </seg>
<seg id="292"> - Was she alone in her cottage? - No. </seg>
<seg id="293"> - And who was it with? - With my wife. </seg>
<seg id="294"> Is he married a third time? </seg>
<seg id="295"> I meant ex-wife, indeed with my ex-second wife. </seg>
<seg id="296"> - Have you reconciled? - No, we see you regularly. </seg>
<seg id="297"> Let's say we're good friends. </seg>
<seg id="298"> How many bedrooms are in his cottage? </seg>
<seg id="299"> My ex wife and I are sleeping together if that's what she wants to know. </seg>
<seg id="300"> When you looked at the ceiling at 3:30 it was not just! </seg>
<seg id="301"> - It seems obvious to me. - Why did he first say that he was alone? </seg>
<seg id="302"> I did not say that, check his record. </seg>
<seg id="303"> She said she woke up before she could sing the cock ... ... and she was alone. - I'll be wrong! </seg>
<seg id="304"> So you are always alone. </seg>
<seg id="305"> - How many days has he come to his farmhouse? - Nine days. </seg>
<seg id="306"> - How do you make sure? - If I say 9 days, it's 9 days! </seg>
<seg id="307"> - First he said 4 days. - Did I say 4 days? SÃƒÂ¬. I have not noticed. </seg>
<seg id="308"> I lose the notion of time when I work. You work to lose consciousness. </seg>
<seg id="309"> Dear Mr. Onoff ... ... as long as he is contradicted in his poems, in his novels, that's all right. But if you continue to contradict yourself when there is a murder ... ... it's okay! </seg>
<seg id="310"> Still a little and we all drown. </seg>
<seg id="311"> We do it now, Commissioner. </seg>
<seg id="312"> How do you live in a place like this? </seg>
<seg id="313"> How do we live in a place like this? </seg>
<seg id="314"> We are ready, Commissioner. </seg>
<seg id="315"> Excuse me, please. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Say. </seg>
<seg id="317"> First in the closet I saw wine bottles. </seg>
<seg id="318"> Could I have...? </seg>
<seg id="319"> This wine is very good. </seg>
<seg id="320"> From these parts they say it is miraculous. </seg>
<seg id="321"> - Please, drink. - Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="322"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="323"> - Good, huh? - It's just good. </seg>
<seg id="324"> - Good. - She's still drinking. </seg>
<seg id="325"> Worth as a wish: good birthday, master. Today is February 3rd. </seg>
<seg id="326"> Yeah, it's true. It's my birthday. </seg>
<seg id="327"> - Teacher, can I ask you a question? - Do not you know anything else here? </seg>
<seg id="328"> Before you get angry because I whistled that motive, remember? </seg>
<seg id="329"> I did not have it with her. Believe me, I'm sorry. </seg>
<seg id="330"> Strength, give him a hand. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I know I'm not intoned ... ... but did she recognize it? - Of course I recognized her. </seg>
<seg id="332"> It's a beautiful song. How many times will it be heard around the world! But that song is a piece of my life. </seg>
<seg id="333"> What did I say about light? When it rains... </seg>
<seg id="334"> Teacher, sit here and do not move. </seg>
<seg id="335"> Will they, where are the candles? </seg>
<seg id="336"> I'm from there, look for lÃƒÂ. </seg>
<seg id="337"> - Hurry up. - All right. </seg>
<seg id="338"> Master! Master, do not ... Do you like wine, huh? Where did the glass put it? </seg>
<seg id="339"> Help ... Mum ... Open, AndrÃ ©! Wake up! It's nothing! </seg>
<seg id="340"> - His name. - Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="341"> Place and date of birth. </seg>
<seg id="342"> Auver-sur, on February 3rd, San Biagio's day. </seg>
<seg id="343"> - Which year? - 1946. </seg>
<seg id="344"> - Profession? - Writer. </seg>
<seg id="345"> - Married? - Twice. </seg>
<seg id="346"> - Sons? - Zero. </seg>
<seg id="347"> How many days has he arrived at his mountain cottage? </seg>
<seg id="348"> Four. </seg>
<seg id="349"> Before he had said four, then nine, now four. </seg>
<seg id="350"> Four. </seg>
<seg id="351"> And with whom did he come? </seg>
<seg id="352"> With my ex-second wife. </seg>
<seg id="353"> - What's your second ex-wife's name? - Daniela. </seg>
<seg id="354"> Daniela February. </seg>
<seg id="355"> - Was not she your agent? - it's the same. </seg>
<seg id="356"> - What does it mean? - My ex-second wife is my agent. </seg>
<seg id="357"> - She's back at the station? - SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="358"> - At what time? - Before the dusk. </seg>
<seg id="359"> - Then what did he do? - I stayed home. </seg>
<seg id="360"> Has she stayed home or is she home? </seg>
<seg id="361"> I repeat, I stayed all day at home. </seg>
<seg id="362"> All day. </seg>
<seg id="363"> Can I have wine? </seg>
<seg id="364"> If she stayed all day at home ... ... how could she accompany Daniela February to the station? </seg>
<seg id="365"> I did not accompany her, she went alone. </seg>
<seg id="366"> After she left who came to visit her at home? </seg>
<seg id="367"> Nobody. </seg>
<seg id="368"> - Are you sure? - I remained alone. </seg>
<seg id="369"> I did not come out all night, please believe me. </seg>
<seg id="370"> What did he do after the departure of his agent? What did he do after the departure of his agent? Respond! </seg>
<seg id="371"> I do not remember what I did after that. </seg>
<seg id="372"> - He said he did not go out all day. </seg>
<seg id="373"> - SÃƒÂ¬ ... </seg>
<seg id="374"> How do you know if he says he does not remember what he did next? </seg>
<seg id="375"> What did I do next? </seg>
<seg id="376"> - Are you still at home until you keep a clear memory? - SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="377"> It can therefore be released later. </seg>
<seg id="378"> I do not remember. </seg>
<seg id="379"> She no longer has to remember. </seg>
<seg id="380"> By now he has to confess that he has told me a lot of bales! </seg>
<seg id="381"> First said she came to the farmhouse alone ... ... to have received her agent's visit ... ... and to have her escorted to the station between 17 and 18. </seg>
<seg id="382"> Then he thinks back to us: he has come with his wife ... ... in fact, his former wife, who is also the agent. </seg>
<seg id="383"> But he did not return to the station, he left alone. </seg>
<seg id="384"> Mr. Onoff ... </seg>
<seg id="385"> ... at that station there is only one fucking train ... ... that has never stopped for a single fuckin 'minute ... ... since she came to her cottage ... ... for the simple reason that there has never been a station here. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Never. </seg>
<seg id="387"> She is not worthy of the works she has written. </seg>
<seg id="388"> His novels, his tales, his poems, his songs ... ... are worth more than her. - I hope so. </seg>
<seg id="389"> Tell the truth, confess! He is taking the biggest cantonage of his not brilliant career. </seg>
<seg id="390"> So why did he try to escape like a thief of hens, eh? </seg>
<seg id="391"> Why do not you prove his innocence and do not clear my suspicions? </seg>
<seg id="392"> I tell him why he does not. Because she has committed a murder for tonight. </seg>
<seg id="393"> I do not know if someone was killed and where he was killed. </seg>
<seg id="394"> And if someone was killed, I do not know if she's an old lady ... ... a kid, a goat, a scarecrow! </seg>
<seg id="395"> She does not know anything about it, but we will tell who the victim is. </seg>
<seg id="396"> He accuses me of being a murderer ... ... and pretends to know who the victim is from me! </seg>
<seg id="397"> What kind of policeman is he? A sick man! A fool! </seg>
<seg id="398"> I've never been a great cop and maybe they will never be ... ... but in my not brilliant career I've been involved in so many homicides. </seg>
<seg id="399"> Many have not been able to solve them ... ... for others I've built solutions that have turned out to be wrong. In some cases luck has given me the opportunity ... ... to take the exact reasoning and find some small key ... ... to work in some small lock. </seg>
<seg id="400"> A few times I hit the target because of my only intelligence. </seg>
<seg id="401"> But this is the first time I get caught in a murder ... ... whose only enigma to solve is the assassin's identity. </seg>
<seg id="402"> Unfortunately, I'm not in the condition to do so ... ... because her victim has a horribly disfigured face ... ... and he will not be able to identify before tomorrow. </seg>
<seg id="403"> Do you know what I think? </seg>
<seg id="404"> No. </seg>
<seg id="405"> That she murdered her. </seg>
<seg id="406"> And I'm a good scapegoat arrived at the right time. </seg>
<seg id="407"> - How do you know he's a man? - What a man? She said, "Do you know what I think?" </seg>
<seg id="408"> She wants to tell me things I did not say. </seg>
<seg id="409"> But I know it's a man! </seg>
<seg id="410"> I do not know anything, she's confusing the waters to make me contradict. </seg>
<seg id="411"> You know better than me if he is a man or a woman. </seg>
<seg id="412"> He has no evidence and he will not be a blanket of memory. </seg>
<seg id="413"> An empty memory banal! </seg>
<seg id="414"> Here it is. </seg>
<seg id="415"> "Not to die of anguish or shame ..." "... men are condemned to forget the unpleasant things." </seg>
<seg id="416"> "They are more unpleasant before they begin to forget about it." </seg>
<seg id="417"> It's a phrase, my dear Onoff! </seg>
<seg id="418"> The man who wrote this great truth ... ... must have done something very unpleasant tonight ... ... not to remember what he did a few hours ago. If the writers knew in what mouths they would end their writing ... ... they would cut their hand. </seg>
<seg id="419"> And it would be a pity! </seg>
<seg id="420"> Do you believe in God? After all, he is the top writer. </seg>
<seg id="421"> If he knew how mediocre those works would be, he would have to give up too many things. - It's not hard to believe in God. </seg>
<seg id="422"> It has happened to me hundreds of times ... ... but on many occasions I confess I felt ashamed of Him. </seg>
<seg id="423"> He would have been an excellent writer if he was limited to describing landscapes. </seg>
<seg id="424"> - Excuse me, Commissioner. - I'm confused. </seg>
<seg id="425"> He affirms that God is an author of irrelevant importance. </seg>
<seg id="426"> Because when I quote a book, do I feel so annoyed? </seg>
<seg id="427"> My job is to write, to hear about my books I do not care. </seg>
<seg id="428"> Language does not work much to nothing in this world. </seg>
<seg id="429"> It is used for police interrogations. </seg>
<seg id="430"> Now I understand why it does not publish anything more than six years. </seg>
<seg id="431"> I had thought of another creative crisis. </seg>
<seg id="432"> What does it refer to? </seg>
<seg id="433"> In the three years of silence that preceded the exit of "The Palace of the Nine Borders". </seg>
<seg id="434"> It has not been so long ... ... but I remember the newspapers talking about crises ... ... or the terror of the white page. </seg>
<seg id="435"> Bravo! </seg>
<seg id="436"> She knows me more than I do not remember myself. - Compliments! - We can bet. </seg>
<seg id="437"> Disappointed? </seg>
<seg id="438"> Sincerely, yes. </seg>
<seg id="439"> You should never meet your own myths. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Seeing close by you realize they have boobs. </seg>
<seg id="441"> Risks to discover that the great works that made you dream so much ... ... they thought you were sitting on the pussy ... ... waiting for a drain of diarrhea. </seg>
<seg id="442"> Do you think you have many enemies? - Of course! </seg>
<seg id="443"> One of them came to me today to get my tongues and I killed him. </seg>
<seg id="444"> Have you ever owned firearms? </seg>
<seg id="445"> - No. - Are you sure? </seg>
<seg id="446"> I never owned any kind of weapon. </seg>
<seg id="447"> I can not shoot and I have never fired. </seg>
<seg id="448"> Let the truth tell the corpse that he hid down. How does he say there is a corpse? </seg>
<seg id="449"> I saw him with my eyes as you pulled him out of the van. You can accuse me of abusing someone of his agents ... ... everything else is chatting, he has no evidence against me. </seg>
<seg id="450"> He has no motive to accuse me of murder! </seg>
<seg id="451"> She says she does not know who the victim is. </seg>
<seg id="452"> Tomorrow will have an appointment with the Minister of Culture. </seg>
<seg id="453"> - Let me go, otherwise ... - It's about to commit another crime. </seg>
<seg id="454"> I advise you to be silent. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Sit down. </seg>
<seg id="456"> I will follow his advice to keep silent. </seg>
<seg id="457"> Dear Onoff ... ... maybe I will not be able to prove his guilt. In a sense, I even wish him. </seg>
<seg id="458"> But know she will not go to any appointment with any minister ... ... until he tells me what he did last night after sunset ... ... at the cost of telling me that he was sitting all the time drink ... ... waiting for a diarrhea attack! </seg>
<seg id="459"> Commissioner, do you want me to move my desk? </seg>
<seg id="460"> PerchÃƒÂ ©? It'll be awake. </seg>
<seg id="461"> I have the impression that the night will be long. </seg>
<seg id="462"> Go on. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Has your former second wife resigned? </seg>
<seg id="464"> Do you live with someone? </seg>
<seg id="465"> Do you have a lover? </seg>
<seg id="466"> I will follow his advice to keep silent. As impressive as it may seem ... ... suppose none of you know the place well ... ... and that his former second wife did not go to the station ... ... but rather to look for a any station nearby to leave. </seg>
<seg id="467"> But then how did he think he was going to retrieve the car? </seg>
<seg id="468"> I will follow his advice to keep silent. </seg>
<seg id="469"> Maybe he went looking for the station accompanied by someone else ... ... someone who then came back to his cottage. Who? </seg>
<seg id="470"> I will follow his advice to keep silent. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Or just just does not play. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Perhaps her ex-wife was still holding her company ... ... but in this case where had she been stopped by my agents? </seg>
<seg id="473"> And why did he go so far as to not have more breath to talk? </seg>
<seg id="474"> I will follow his advice to keep silent. </seg>
<seg id="475"> Is 93633396 the number of his former second wife? </seg>
<seg id="476"> I will follow his advice to keep silent. </seg>
<seg id="477"> You specifically asked to call this number ... ... and he insinuated that the victim could be a man to protect himself ... ... to defeat. </seg>
<seg id="478"> Is the victim the 93633396 woman? </seg>
<seg id="479"> And if it's not her ... ... how many want it to be the victims of a lonely successful man ... ... that nobody has seen around for several years? </seg>
<seg id="480"> How many people do you know so well that you can get to him in a place ... ... where you say you go very rarely? </seg>
<seg id="481"> The circle can not be infinite. </seg>
<seg id="482"> A friend? </seg>
<seg id="483"> A lover? </seg>
<seg id="484"> A relative? </seg>

<seg id="486"> Your doctor? Your lawyer? </seg>
<seg id="487"> One of your collaborators? </seg>
<seg id="488"> A journalist? </seg>
<seg id="489"> A photographer looking for scoop? </seg>
<seg id="490"> A student who breaks her soul with a list of idiotic questions? </seg>
<seg id="491"> His publisher? </seg>
<seg id="492"> Who among these came to visit her yesterday afternoon? </seg>
<seg id="493"> I will follow his advice to keep silent. </seg>
<seg id="494"> She comes from a military family, her father was a war hero ... ... She was an officer ... ... and she wants me to drink that she has never had a gun between the hands? </seg>
<seg id="495"> Will it still follow my advice to keep silent? </seg>
<seg id="496"> Enough! Stop it, Onoff! </seg>
<seg id="497"> Basta cosÃ¬. </seg>
<seg id="498"> Now we change music, Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="499"> You do not mind me. </seg>
<seg id="500"> His biography is known all over the world, I know her by heart. </seg>
<seg id="501"> "He was born into a ditch on the edge of a field." </seg>
<seg id="502"> "With your teeth she cut the cord." "He made a knot and he left." </seg>
<seg id="503"> "They called him Biagio February ..." "... because he was found on a cold February night ..." "... and it was San Biagio's day." </seg>
<seg id="504"> Biagio February I am. </seg>
<seg id="505"> My biography is false. </seg>
<seg id="506"> From beginning to end I wrote it myself. </seg>
<seg id="507"> It was an old man who invented a name suitable for a writer ... ... the name of Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="508"> It was called Foben. My best friend. </seg>
<seg id="509"> It was he who made me great. </seg>
<seg id="510"> I've never been to the army. </seg>
<seg id="511"> I can not shoot. </seg>
<seg id="512"> I grew up ... ... in an orphanage. </seg>
<seg id="513"> They only gave us milk. Every day warm milk, morning and evening. </seg>
<seg id="514"> I hate hot milk. </seg>
<seg id="515"> Paola, do you make me a coffee please? Get me a coffee. </seg>
<seg id="516"> I had a dream ... ... a horrible dream. </seg>
<seg id="517"> I dreamed that I had killed my publisher. I recovered my manuscript and ran, ran, ran to you. </seg>
<seg id="518"> But your house was a police station ... ... and there was a terrible commissioner ... ... who recited my novels by memory. </seg>
<seg id="519"> Paola, get me a sheet before you forget everything. </seg>
<seg id="520"> Paola! </seg>
<seg id="521"> Ah! </seg>
<seg id="522"> I've never seen the commissar so worried. </seg>
<seg id="523"> - It's really in trouble. - It's a terrible situation. You will see that it will end there. </seg>
<seg id="524"> - The marshal says no. - I can not stand the Marshal. </seg>
<seg id="525"> Do as if there was not. Bottom is a good person. </seg>
<seg id="526"> - Everyone's good here. - I still have to get used to it. I need time. </seg>
<seg id="527"> - What time will it be? </seg>
<seg id="528"> She only slept for an hour. </seg>
<seg id="529"> Do you want to warm up a bit? </seg>
<seg id="530"> Could I have paper? I have to take notes. </seg>
<seg id="531"> If it is OK. </seg>
<seg id="532"> Give him some hot wine. </seg>
<seg id="533"> - Do you have an idea for a new book? - You do not write why you have an idea. It is written because you do not know anything else. </seg>
<seg id="534"> Shit! </seg>
<seg id="535"> Shit! </seg>
<seg id="536"> - I'm mortified ... - Keep silent at least. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Be silent. </seg>
<seg id="538"> When I tell him, I will not believe anyone. </seg>
<seg id="539"> How can such a place be absurd? </seg>
<seg id="540"> This is not the ideal place for one as she traveled so much. </seg>
<seg id="541"> Here we are not equipped with anything, we are not in a beautiful city. - Here we have only the woods. - I've been working here for 15 years. </seg>
<seg id="542"> I've always found myself well, I would not go back to the city even dead. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Could I Use Your Typewriter? </seg>
<seg id="544"> Logic would be logical, but it must ask the Commissioner. Ask him. </seg>
<seg id="545"> Can you kill ... ... and then forget it? </seg>
<seg id="546"> Remember, remember it's like a dip at the bottom of the sea. Remember, remember what is to be deleted. And forgetting, and forgetting ... is that you lose things. And forgetting, and forgetting ... will end rare joys. And forgetting, and forgetting ... is that you lose things. </seg>
<seg id="547"> Have you ever seen this man, Mr. February? </seg>
<seg id="548"> I seem to know it. </seg>
<seg id="549"> Who is it? </seg>
<seg id="550"> He was my high school math teacher. </seg>
<seg id="551"> And then? </seg>
<seg id="552"> I need him all my love for numbers, symmetries ... geometric reasoning. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Professor Trivarchi. </seg>
<seg id="554"> Demonstrate the theorems as they tell the fairy tales. </seg>
<seg id="555"> His words did not come to our ears ... ... they reached our brain directly. </seg>
<seg id="556"> I learned from her lessons a genuine enjoyment. </seg>
<seg id="557"> Two parallel lines never meet ... ... however you can imagine the existence of a point ... ... so far in space ... ... but so far in the infinite .. ... that you can believe and admit ... ... that the two faces meet you. </seg>
<seg id="558"> Here it is. </seg>
<seg id="559"> We will call that point "improper point". </seg>
<seg id="560"> Never seen. Are you sure? </seg>
<seg id="561"> - So then? - SÃƒÂ¬ ... </seg>
<seg id="562"> - Yeah, I know her. - Would you say that? </seg>
<seg id="563"> A girl I loved. </seg>
<seg id="564"> When did you last see it? </seg>
<seg id="565"> One morning I left her in the hotel while she slept ... ... and I went to the airport ... ... without even greeting her. </seg>
<seg id="566"> Twenty years ago. </seg>
<seg id="567"> How did you get these photos? </seg>
<seg id="568"> - Try to understand it alone. - I've been looking for you for so long. </seg>
<seg id="569"> Did you look for her even last night? </seg>
<seg id="570"> Yeah, I've been looking for you last night too. </seg>
<seg id="571"> For years I've been freaking everywhere and I do not find them ... ... but not just those two, there were so many. - A mountain of photographs. </seg>
<seg id="572"> - Why are they so important? </seg>
<seg id="573"> They are the testimony of a strange habit ... ... or if they prefer a pity I've had throughout my life. </seg>
<seg id="574"> I took a camera with me and collected the faces I met. A bizarre way to keep a diary! </seg>
<seg id="575"> A game that I abandoned the day I made the decision ... ... to withdraw from public life. </seg>
<seg id="576"> Later, I lost everything. </seg>
<seg id="577"> In those photos there are my friends and my opponents ... ... People I love and love ... ... and those I did not know and did not want to love. </seg>
<seg id="578"> People who held my hand and smiled at me. And those who just looked at me ... ... without saying anything. Thousands, thousands, thousands of faces. </seg>
<seg id="579"> - Where did she get it? - I searched for her cottage. </seg>
<seg id="580"> Evidently he did not look good. </seg>
<seg id="581"> Look look! All these faces ... </seg>
<seg id="582"> Who is it? </seg>
<seg id="583"> ÃƒÃ † Foben. </seg>
<seg id="584"> Foben? </seg>
<seg id="585"> He who invented the name Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="586"> A bitch? </seg>
<seg id="587"> SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="588"> A bitch. </seg>
<seg id="589"> He who met last night? </seg>
<seg id="590"> And how could I have? </seg>
<seg id="591"> In his memory I dedicated "The Palace of the Nine Borders." </seg>
<seg id="592"> Dedicated? </seg>
<seg id="593"> You should know, she has never dedicated a book to anyone. </seg>
<seg id="594"> Everybody knows. </seg>
<seg id="595"> It is impossible. </seg>
<seg id="596"> Impossible? </seg>
<seg id="597"> Do not dirty it, please. </seg>
<seg id="598"> It's not ... it's not possible! </seg>
<seg id="599"> Perhaps he will dedicate to Foben his unpublished book. </seg>
<seg id="600"> No... </seg>
<seg id="601"> It could only be that. </seg>
<seg id="602"> Why this one? </seg>
<seg id="603"> Foben was a vagrant. </seg>
<seg id="604"> He was the most intelligent man I've ever met. </seg>
<seg id="605"> I never got to know her past. </seg>
<seg id="606"> He did not want to talk about it. </seg>
<seg id="607"> I've always believed it was an important personality. </seg>
<seg id="608"> After the success of my first books I offered him to change life ... ... but he never wanted to abandon his den under a bridge. </seg>
<seg id="609"> He was an out of head. </seg>
<seg id="610"> She spent time writing on the back of old calendars or notebooks ... ... or whatever she found in the dustbin. </seg>
<seg id="611"> And he wrote rivers, rivers, and rivers of words. Nonsense words. </seg>
<seg id="612"> One day a letter was delivered to me. I opened it ... ... and I noticed for the first time that he had written something legible ... ... more readable. Each sentence respected the most subtle grammatical rules. </seg>
<seg id="613"> I knew he was dead. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Why does he say he has dedicated a book if he did not? </seg>
<seg id="615"> After a while I went through a very painful period. </seg>
<seg id="616"> I could not write and I could not live. </seg>
<seg id="617"> I spent whole weeks sitting at the desk ... ... without finding anything in me to say. </seg>
<seg id="618"> I often thought of that unreadable stream of words on words ... ... that Foben left me in gift. </seg>
<seg id="619"> - I filled the days by reading that stuff. - What did he hope to find? It was not possible for a moment before death to write a letter ... ... so perfect after spending a lifetime chasing waste ... ... to align meaningless words. </seg>
<seg id="620"> For three years I was only concerned with that monstrous rebus. </seg>
<seg id="621"> The newspapers talked of my silence, impotence, aphasia, misanthropy ... ... but I was able to transform my hunger into an endless excitement. </seg>
<seg id="622"> Thousands of times I dismounted and resumed that indecipherable ocean ... ... after silvia ... ... and finally I discovered the mystery. </seg>
<seg id="623"> It was an incredible simplicity. </seg>
<seg id="624"> Foben did not write. He copied what was perfectly written in his mind. </seg>
<seg id="625"> He conveyed the words simultaneously on 9 notebooks ... ... breaking down the sentences in the same way that the numbers are disintegrating. </seg>
<seg id="626"> It was rare to find two terms that were meaningful next to each other ... ... if not accidentally. </seg>
<seg id="627"> It was extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id="628"> Finally, I could recomposure the story. </seg>
<seg id="629"> I could not even imagine you could write something ... ... so pure ... ... so authentic. </seg>
<seg id="630"> I would have liked to read it. </seg>
<seg id="631"> He did. </seg>
<seg id="632"> Let me print this novel: "The palace of the nine frontiers" ... ... under my signature. </seg>
<seg id="633"> Success was amazing ... ... after so many years of silence. </seg>
<seg id="634"> But I was a finished man and I knew only myself. </seg>
<seg id="635"> Alcohol became my only joy, I needed it every second. </seg>
<seg id="636"> I deeply disdain what I wrote later on. </seg>
<seg id="637"> They will not be able to reach that level. </seg>
<seg id="638"> I'm condemned to write the same thing because when I write ... ... it's like drinking. </seg>
<seg id="639"> My art is nothing but a miserable medicine. </seg>
<seg id="640"> I hate those who want me to publish what I write. </seg>
<seg id="641"> What I'm just writing about not drinking. </seg>
<seg id="642"> Who wants to persuade her to publish again? </seg>
<seg id="643"> My publisher, for example. </seg>
<seg id="644"> - When did you see him last time? - I can not remember it. </seg>
<seg id="645"> Was it yesterday? </seg>
<seg id="646"> - Do you think he killed him? - I came to see him at the farmhouse. </seg>
<seg id="647"> - I do not remember anything. - What did he do afternoon after ... ... after he was looking for photographs in the attic? </seg>
<seg id="648"> I do not know. I kept looking. Did you try this? SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="649"> After what time did he go? </seg>
<seg id="650"> After that I sat and looked. Has it ever been hours and hours to watch from a window? Hours and hours without seeing anything. </seg>
<seg id="651"> And then what did he do? </seg>
<seg id="652"> Paola is back. </seg>
<seg id="653"> Paola? </seg>
<seg id="654"> So far he had said he was in the company of Daniela February. </seg>
<seg id="655"> Only Paola was at the farmhouse. </seg>
<seg id="656"> - Daniela never see her. - Who's Paola? </seg>
<seg id="657"> Who is Paola? </seg>
<seg id="658"> Who is Paola? </seg>
<seg id="659"> ÃƒÂ † everything. </seg>
<seg id="660"> Why did not she want to talk about her before? </seg>
<seg id="661"> Because it is a great discomfort to be loved. </seg>
<seg id="662"> Paola. </seg>
<seg id="663"> So Paola came with her to the farmhouse. </seg>
<seg id="664"> After a few days she left. </seg>
<seg id="665"> Maybe last night. </seg>
<seg id="666"> Then in the afternoon she came back to her, so what? </seg>
<seg id="667"> SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="668"> Why is it coming back so soon? What happened? </seg>
<seg id="669"> I do not want to go back home. </seg>
<seg id="670"> Do you want to bring her home? </seg>
<seg id="671"> Why does Paola want to take her away? </seg>
<seg id="672"> I want to stay alone, go away with them. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Go away with Caesar. </seg>
<seg id="674"> Who is there with Paola? </seg>
<seg id="675"> Friends, unbearable friends. </seg>
<seg id="676"> Caesar. </seg>
<seg id="677"> Who is Caesar? His publisher? </seg>
<seg id="678"> I'll get you tonight, go away. </seg>
<seg id="679"> Why do you want to stay alone? </seg>
<seg id="680"> She cut her hair. </seg>
<seg id="681"> - SÃƒÂ¬. - Why? </seg>
<seg id="682"> Why did she shave her beard? </seg>
<seg id="683"> I want to look at myself. </seg>
<seg id="684"> He wanted to see his face as he did not see for so many years. </seg>
<seg id="685"> And after he did? </seg>
<seg id="686"> I do not find the words. </seg>
<seg id="687"> I do not know what to write. </seg>
<seg id="688"> She tried to write something. </seg>
<seg id="689"> He wrote this. </seg>
<seg id="690"> "I have nothing to say that can be said." </seg>
<seg id="691"> "I would have preferred silence, my most faithful friend ..." "... elegant, infallible, suitable for everything." "But as far as he has been able to live in isolation ..." "... the most complete ..." "... now abstain the absurd desire to thank, sorry ..." "... give an explanation. " "A sign, which I would not know ..." "Forget me often." "Forget ... Onoff!" </seg>
<seg id="692"> It is the only one who has not recognized it. </seg>
<seg id="693"> Foben had done it. </seg>
<seg id="694"> It's been five years in this photo. </seg>
<seg id="695"> I had given her my word, Master. </seg>
<seg id="696"> If you still want to call ... </seg>
<seg id="697"> Ready? Paola, it's me. - It's me, Paola! - Ready? - Can you hear me? - But who is it? - I have to talk to you, tell you many things. - Ready? - Please listen to me! - Ready? - Ready? - It's me, Onoff! I must tell you something very important. - Ready? - Forgive me, Paola! - What I did is terrible ... - I do not feel anything, ready! Ready? Ready? Why do not you hear me, Paola? </seg>
<seg id="698"> Tell the Minister I do not expect more. </seg>
<seg id="699"> Drink, it's good for you. </seg>
<seg id="700"> Drink. </seg>
<seg id="701"> - ÃƒÃ † latte? - SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="702"> Warm milk. It will do you good. </seg>
<seg id="703"> Do not know anything yet? You did not even know that either. Not even them, not even the commissar. Nobody knows when he comes here. </seg>
<seg id="704"> Nice day. </seg>
<seg id="705"> Good sign, dear Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="706"> - There is something I would like to ask. - Please. </seg>
<seg id="707"> Could I take my photographs with me? </seg>
<seg id="708"> In fact we would not have the right to do it because ... ... everything I pick up has to be put in place. </seg>
<seg id="709"> But who will notice the disappearance of his lost photos? </seg>
<seg id="710"> In the study ... ... there was a desk ... - A manuscript? Did he even pick up the manuscript of my last book? </seg>
<seg id="711"> No. </seg>
<seg id="712"> - Sin. - But I've read a few pages ... ... just enough to realize that it's magnificent. Unparalleled. Sublime. </seg>
<seg id="713"> In my opinion his most beautiful book ... ... the best among the things he wrote among those he did not write. </seg>
<seg id="714"> It will be a huge success. </seg>
<seg id="715"> And now a good trip. </seg>
<seg id="716"> Good trip, master. </seg>
<seg id="717"> Thank you very much, Commissioner. </seg>
<seg id="718"> I do not know his name. </seg>
<seg id="719"> Call me Leonardo Da Vinci too. </seg>

<seg id="56"> Or erotic, kind if you like humiliation and stuff like that. </seg>

<seg id="72"> At 14. 15 ... a while ago. </seg>

<seg id="100"> We will organize other auditions. </seg>
<seg id="101"> Now I'm here, and I wanna go back tomorrow. </seg>
<seg id="102"> My day was also very stressful. </seg>
<seg id="103"> I had auditions at an army of failures. </seg>
<seg id="104"> One even a tooth device. </seg>
<seg id="105"> - It would not be the case now. - Okay. - I need to rest. </seg>
<seg id="106"> - Then they wait for me for dinner. - Yes, I see. </seg>
<seg id="107"> It will be better to do it when I become less tired. </seg>
<seg id="108"> Thanks for being kidded and compliments for the dress. </seg>
<seg id="109"> - Let's see you very soon. - Maybe it was but it's nice to say it. </seg>

<seg id="122"> I do not talk to you, someone has just come in. </seg>
<seg id="123"> No I do not think so. </seg>
<seg id="124"> Then I take sushi along the road. </seg>
<seg id="125"> Hello. </seg>
<seg id="126"> Can you help me close it? </seg>
<seg id="127"> Thomas Noavachek in person will give me the jokes. </seg>
<seg id="128"> It will not be of great help to them, I'm not an actor. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Let's go, she's perfect. It's spit Kowalski. </seg>
<seg id="130"> - Well, Kushemski. - Kushemski. </seg>
<seg id="131"> - She is Kushemski. - I would not say that. </seg>
<seg id="132"> At your service, mess. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Where do we start from? Choose her, I do not have any preferences. </seg>
<seg id="134"> Let's take the first scene. </seg>
<seg id="135"> Okay. </seg>
<seg id="136"> - Does it have its share? - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="137"> - It's a bit run-down. - That's the full text. </seg>
<seg id="138"> - Who gave it to her? - I do not know. </seg>
<seg id="139"> - He sent me my agent. - And how did he get it? </seg>
<seg id="140"> Is this a problem? Is it top secret? Should not I see it? </seg>
<seg id="141"> It does not matter. </seg>
<seg id="142"> - Did you read it? - Yes, escape, on the metro. </seg>
<seg id="143"> I have no trace of anything. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Do you have Lou Reed's "Venus in furs" song? </seg>
<seg id="145"> No, it's from an Austrian novel: </seg>
<seg id="146"> "The Furry Venus" written by Léopold Von Sacher-Masoch. </seg>
<seg id="147"> I bet he can read the Austrian and read it in the original version. </seg>
<seg id="148"> Effectively yes. </seg>
<seg id="149"> The book made a scandal when it was published in 1870. </seg>
<seg id="150"> I believe it! It is only a sad saddle porn. </seg>
<seg id="151"> - It's not a porn sad. - Do not you find porn? </seg>
<seg id="152"> Not a little bit? </seg>
<seg id="153"> Since it was written in the Middle East in the 1800s and something? </seg>
<seg id="154"> "Furry Venus" is a beautiful love story ... </seg>
<seg id="155"> .. is one of the great texts in world literature. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Oh yes? For me, it's a porn. </seg>
<seg id="157"> And sadomasochism I know what it is, do them in the theater. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The term "masochism" comes from Sacher-Masoch and this book. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Ah! Masochism-Masoch. I should have arrived! </seg>
<seg id="160"> So this guy gave his name to sadomaso. </seg>
<seg id="161"> It was not his intention. - I would like to see! </seg>
<seg id="162"> Believe me a wrote a nice novel and everyone said it was porn. </seg>
<seg id="163"> - You broke the book? - No, I did it. </seg>
<seg id="164"> I have reinvented the dialogues, situations and ... </seg>
<seg id="165"> - There's so much to me here. - Great! </seg>
<seg id="166"> Do you wanna, kind, like place? </seg>
<seg id="167"> Type in a hotel that you find in a remote spot to the east ... </seg>
<seg id="168"> In the Austro-Hungarian Empire. - Make me remember. </seg>
<seg id="169"> - It's complicated. - Is that kind of a nice hotel? </seg>
<seg id="170"> Yes, it is a spa for wealthy people ... </seg>
<seg id="171"> .. a luxurious place. </seg>
<seg id="172"> The curtain is raised and Kushemski is in his room. </seg>
<seg id="173"> He's reading his book while he's having coffee. </seg>
<seg id="174"> And then ... toc toc! Enter Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="175"> And is it symbolic of the character of the character you read? </seg>
<seg id="176"> No, but there are still people reading the books. </seg>
<seg id="177"> - Even for books of paper. - Wrong. </seg>
<seg id="178"> This guy's what's called? Sévran, Séveran, Savrìne .. </seg>
<seg id="179"> - Séviser Von Kushemski. - Yes, yes. </seg>
<seg id="180"> What kind of person is it? </seg>
<seg id="181"> Tell me about the agents. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Rich, lazy, typical of his era, clever, traveler, educated. </seg>
<seg id="183"> - Intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="184"> - Just saying. - Ah, "so to speak." Adoro. </seg>
<seg id="185"> - I do not know it for so long. - What's strange? </seg>
<seg id="186"> - So she is a distinguished one, like her. - Do you want to talk about the character? </seg>
<seg id="187"> Yes, I know it by heart ... but yes, please, if you want! </seg>
<seg id="188"> I would say that under more than a dozen points is a joyous woman of her time ... </seg>
<seg id="189"> .. in spite of the principles that professes but ... </seg>
<seg id="190"> - In spite of what? Principles that profess. </seg>
<seg id="191"> A first person is a person in the post, posed and very educated. </seg>
<seg id="192"> Do not tell me! Anything else? </seg>
<seg id="193"> Something I do not know already like ... </seg>
<seg id="194"> Let's lose, I'll arrange it. </seg>
<seg id="195"> - Does it bother you if I change lighting? - Like lighting! </seg>
<seg id="196"> It's a bit over, do not you think? </seg>
<seg id="197"> Please, do it as if it were at your home. </seg>
<seg id="198"> Is not this better? </seg>
<seg id="199"> Not bad. </seg>
<seg id="200"> Aspects. </seg>
<seg id="201"> I would not know what button to crush. </seg>
<seg id="202"> So it is much better. </seg>
<seg id="203"> This is what I imagine. </seg>
<seg id="204"> Yes, it's the diva. </seg>
<seg id="205"> The scribe? </seg>
<seg id="206"> The book that has been reported to him? </seg>
<seg id="207"> There is the postcard, great! </seg>
<seg id="208"> What is this? </seg>
<seg id="209"> - A fake symbol? - They're the remains of the previous show. </seg>
<seg id="210"> A Belgian production of ... </seg>
<seg id="211"> "Red Shadows" adapted to musical comedy. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Do you want me to put me on? </seg>
<seg id="213"> Do you prefer ... </seg>
<seg id="214"> ..just in the middle. </seg>
<seg id="215"> Courtyard or garden side? - Garden. </seg>
<seg id="216"> Do you want us to re-read the text before we begin? </seg>
<seg id="217"> No, let's start. Up to do? </seg>
<seg id="218"> - End of page three. - Okay. And then he threw me out, did not they? </seg>
<seg id="219"> - In the meantime, we think we're screaming. - And then he threw me out. </seg>
<seg id="220"> - Look, I ... Ah, yes! Dimenticaνo ... </seg>
<seg id="221"> - The phrase that on page 0, like the quotation. The epigraph? </seg>
<seg id="222"> Yes, that. </seg>

<seg id="224"> It is a quotation that appears in the novel, is taken from the Book of Judith. </seg>
<seg id="225"> Is it in the Bible? - In the Apocryphal Books of the Bible, yes. </seg>
<seg id="226"> I do not know anything at all. </seg>
<seg id="227"> - Oh yes. Do not you think it's sexist? </seg>
<seg id="228"> "The Almighty Lord struck him and put him in the hands of a woman." </seg>
<seg id="229"> I just mention it to Sacher-Masoch's novel. </seg>
<seg id="230"> Yes, but I did not put it on zero page ... </seg>
<seg id="231"> She does nothing, I do not care, I'm just an actress. </seg>
<seg id="232"> I forget the fur! </seg>
<seg id="233"> - She's holding a stool, is not she? - Yes, in fact. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Fur, fur ... </seg>
<seg id="235"> Soft fur ... </seg>
<seg id="236"> Maybe it is not ... </seg>

<seg id="253"> Thank you very much. </seg>
<seg id="254"> I just asked the waitress to retire. </seg>
<seg id="255"> I should have done it, but there is a bold postcard inside. </seg>
<seg id="256"> It's a Titian, are not you? </seg>
<seg id="257"> Yup. </seg>
<seg id="258"> "Venus in the Mirror", one of my favorite paintings. </seg>
<seg id="259"> His Venus looks like he is well served ... </seg>

<seg id="266"> I could not avoid noticing the strange poetry written in the back. </seg>
<seg id="267"> "Furry Venus". Is it his work? </seg>
<seg id="268"> - They're bad guys. - Poor? Really? </seg>
<seg id="269"> "To love and be loved, or what a charm ..." </seg>

<seg id="279"> I appreciate your discretion. </seg>
<seg id="280"> Do you want to sit down for a moment? </seg>
<seg id="281"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="282"> - Can I take the fur? - Very kind to you. </seg>
<seg id="283"> It's a Tartar fur, do not you? </seg>
<seg id="284"> A Caucasian zibellino? I would say Kazakhstan. </seg>
<seg id="285"> A Kazakh cabbage jelly, exactly. </seg>
<seg id="286"> Kushemski, standing, looks at the fur in his hands. </seg>
<seg id="287"> But she's trembling! </seg>
<seg id="288"> Yes, please forgive me. </seg>

<seg id="296"> So you are a poet, Herr Kuskhemski? </seg>
<seg id="297"> Lost time. </seg>
<seg id="298"> And is a passionate fox expert? </seg>
<seg id="299"> The love for the fur is ... </seg>
<seg id="300"> - Jumping this joke, the next is ... - No, read. </seg>
<seg id="301"> Love for fur is innate. </seg>
<seg id="302"> It is a passion given to everyone by nature. </seg>
<seg id="303"> It puts us a little more of a commitment. </seg>
<seg id="304"> Love for fur is innate. </seg>
<seg id="305"> It is a passion given to everyone by nature. </seg>
<seg id="306"> Caring a soft and thick fur ... </seg>

<seg id="308"> I think that for her is not just a gift of nature. </seg>
<seg id="309"> Did her mother embezzle her in a zibellino when she was small? </seg>
<seg id="310"> I'm indiscreet. </seg>
<seg id="311"> Please forgive me. - No me... </seg>
<seg id="312"> It was one of my aunts to have a passion for the fur. </seg>

<seg id="319"> - Very well, Vanda. - I was looking for clutches. </seg>
<seg id="320"> - I did what I could. He seemed very confident. </seg>
<seg id="321"> That's what it means to know how to create an atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="322"> - I'm a professional. - Yeah, yeah ... </seg>
<seg id="323"> - Stop it, I'll drop it red. - I did not say it was perfect. </seg>
<seg id="324"> - No, of course. - Are we going to go for a while? </seg>
<seg id="325"> After Kushemski made his speech ... </seg>
<seg id="326"> .. you go to ... </seg>
<seg id="327"> - Read this to help me enter the character. - żo recito. </seg>
<seg id="328"> - She's doing fine, Thomas. - No, it's an impression. </seg>
<seg id="329"> She speaks very well. </seg>
<seg id="330"> Has anyone ever thought about someone for Kushemski? - Not exactly. </seg>
<seg id="331"> - I have options. - She should do it. </seg>
<seg id="332"> - Yes sure! - I think so seriously. </seg>
<seg id="333"> - She would be very good at it. - However, it is difficult. </seg>
<seg id="334"> - Let's get all this out to the actors ... - He's the director, he's his dad. </seg>
<seg id="335"> - For director is the first one. - It would not be. </seg>
<seg id="336"> I decided to do it because the directors never understand anything. </seg>
<seg id="337"> - You do not know what I endured ... - That's why it's perfect. </seg>
<seg id="338"> - You know what you need to do. - I've got everything in my head. </seg>
<seg id="339"> I want to use the "Lyrical Suite" by Alban Berg for transitions ... </seg>
<seg id="340"> - Great as an idea! - Do you know the "Lyrical Suite"? </seg>
<seg id="341"> No, but do you understand that I want to say? </seg>
<seg id="342"> - You know the story of interiority, characters, everything! - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="343"> For Kushemski, she should look something like an accent ... </seg>
<seg id="344"> ... or stuff like that. - He's a distinguished man. </seg>
<seg id="345"> - Yes. - And with one I do not know ... </seg>
<seg id="346"> Aristocratic. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Is it quite distinct if I move that way? </seg>
<seg id="348"> Or is it just stupid? </seg>
<seg id="349"> It's a bit chunky but it's great. </seg>
<seg id="350"> - Would not it be a room for you? - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="351"> - I was joking! - Want to pass it on? </seg>
<seg id="352"> Courage, it will help. </seg>
<seg id="353"> But it's magnificent. </seg>
<seg id="354"> - Is it wrong or is it vintage? - So they told me. </seg>
<seg id="355"> Siegfried Mueller ... </seg>
<seg id="356"> ..Vienna ... </seg>
<seg id="357"> .. 1869. </seg>
<seg id="358"> I did not do it. </seg>
<seg id="360"> It looks tailor made for her. </seg>
<seg id="361"> - How do you feel about it? - Very well. </seg>
<seg id="362"> And I'm brushing it. </seg>
<seg id="363"> - It's her figure. - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="364"> Hello nice guy. </seg>
<seg id="365"> And that dog collar how much did he pay for it? </seg>
<seg id="366"> It is a reminder of the period when the pavement is bathed. </seg>
<seg id="367"> Joke! </seg>
<seg id="368"> Let's get back from a few more farther backs. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Did her mother embezzle her in a zibellino when she was small? </seg>
<seg id="370"> I'm indiscreet, please excuse me. </seg>

<seg id="380"> Wisdom makes us what we are in an unpredictable moment. </seg>
<seg id="381"> Coffee is your liking? </seg>
<seg id="382"> I just tasted it but it looks great. </seg>
<seg id="383"> And this is symbolic, do not you? Ίl coffee is he ... </seg>
<seg id="384"> .. and she just tasted it but she's already excited. </seg>
<seg id="385"> In fact, he unmasks me. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Have you ever experienced such a "unforeseen moment"? </seg>
<seg id="387"> Actually yes, but I do not want to bother you. </seg>
<seg id="388"> All the while, so fascinates me. </seg>
<seg id="389"> Like one of those English policing novels. </seg>
<seg id="390"> I look like mysterious aunt who loved the fur. </seg>
<seg id="391"> - This part we can skip it. - No, read it. I want to hear it. </seg>

<seg id="400"> ... two in the morning on a screen seem to be dimmed. </seg>
<seg id="401"> If she's yanking her big! </seg>
<seg id="402"> What did your aunt do? </seg>
<seg id="403"> One evening she was hesitant. </seg>
<seg id="404"> It came to my room ... </seg>
<seg id="405"> With his big black coat of Russia. </seg>
<seg id="406"> In the hand there is a need, a branch of birch ... </seg>
<seg id="407"> With her there was the cook and the maid. </seg>
<seg id="408"> The fur has been removed and the sleeves are rolled ... </seg>
<seg id="409"> I have tried to escape ... </seg>
<seg id="410"> The other women have taken hold of me ... </seg>
<seg id="411"> They lowered my pants and threw me on the fur. </seg>
<seg id="412"> They keep me silent as my aunt casts me with her. </seg>
<seg id="413"> My buttocks and bare thighs were on fire. </seg>
<seg id="414"> The maids encourage her. </seg>
<seg id="415"> They played for me, they treat me as feminine. </seg>
<seg id="416"> I do not mind it but my aunt continued to hit me ... </seg>
<seg id="417"> .. until the moment I did not beg to stop ... </seg>
<seg id="418"> .. for piety. </seg>
<seg id="419"> When she finally stopped, she forced me to thank her ... </seg>
<seg id="420"> And kissing her feet. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Then later he left the room threatening to return. </seg>
<seg id="422"> And all this in the presence of the maids ... </seg>
<seg id="423"> And our cat. </seg>
<seg id="424"> Starting from that moment ... </seg>
<seg id="425"> ... fur was no longer a simple fur ... </seg>
<seg id="426"> A branch of birch a simple branch. </seg>
<seg id="427"> In a moment she made me ... what I am. </seg>
<seg id="428"> - And is he coming back? - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="429"> In my dreams, with her black fur and her śerga. </seg>
<seg id="430"> And she wants to make me sleepy again, night after night. </seg>
<seg id="431"> - My friend. Poor? </seg>
<seg id="432"> She taught me the most precious thing in the world. </seg>

<seg id="435"> The Countess has done well to her. </seg>
<seg id="436"> My ideal is quenched. </seg>
<seg id="437"> From that day I look for her double. </seg>
<seg id="438"> And when I meet that woman I will marry her. </seg>
<seg id="439"> This passage is sensational! </seg>
<seg id="440"> Thank you, they asked me a lot of them. </seg>
<seg id="441"> In practical terms, is it a kind of child maltreatment? </seg>
<seg id="442"> It does not matter. </seg>
<seg id="443"> What the fuck does the child abuse with this story? </seg>
<seg id="444"> Punch this, this mania of our day ... </seg>
<seg id="445"> To bring everything back to a social problem of the dick. </seg>
<seg id="446"> - Maltreatment is not just ... - Do not follow the stereotypes! </seg>
<seg id="447"> We are not talking about anthropology or sociology! </seg>
<seg id="448"> - Let's do theater. - Yes, but anyway ... </seg>
<seg id="449"> Here's much more about the issue of corporal punishment. </seg>
<seg id="450"> All right, excuse me! </seg>
<seg id="451"> In what impetuous and dull world we live! </seg>
<seg id="452"> Why do we always try to bring everything back to something else? </seg>
<seg id="453"> What else will he pull out right now? Sexism, racism, class struggle? </seg>
<seg id="454"> Well, you are certainly unique, Herr Kushemski. </seg>
<seg id="455"> If I were in her, I would be careful. </seg>
<seg id="456"> His ideal woman might reel more cruel than he does not want. </seg>
<seg id="457"> I'm ready to run the risk. </seg>
<seg id="458"> I know what she is ... A suzrasensuale. </seg>
<seg id="459"> An ascetic of the ull. </seg>
<seg id="460"> And you, Frau Vanda νon Dunaye, who or what? </seg>
<seg id="461"> I am a pagan. </seg>
<seg id="462"> It means they are playful, beautiful, rich ... </seg>
<seg id="463"> .. and that you can take advantage of them as much as possible. </seg>
<seg id="464"> I will not deny anything. </seg>
<seg id="465"> I have the utmost respect for its principles. </seg>
<seg id="466"> Please excuse me, but I am afraid of his respect. </seg>
<seg id="467"> I will love the man who will please me ... </seg>
<seg id="468"> .. and I'm happy with the man who will make me happy ... </seg>
<seg id="469"> I just do it until it makes me happy and then I'll find another one. </seg>
<seg id="470"> For a man there is no greater cruelty than the unfaithfulness of a woman. </seg>
<seg id="471"> For a woman there is worse: forced loyalty. </seg>
<seg id="472"> - Can I move? - Yes, yes ... he moved. </seg>
<seg id="473"> In our company ... </seg>
<seg id="474"> ... the woman can only have power through the intercession of a man. </seg>
<seg id="475"> What will be the woman when she will equal the man? </seg>
<seg id="476"> When will she hurt her? </seg>
<seg id="477"> Little Vanda is a sack for his time! </seg>
<seg id="478"> How do you know all the jokes? </seg>
<seg id="479"> - I do not know, I learn in a hurry. - He knows all the text by heart! </seg>
<seg id="480"> Did not she say Vanda is in a good position in spite of what? </seg>
<seg id="481"> - Principles that profess. - Here are those. - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="482"> According to you Vanda does not believe all these stories. </seg>
<seg id="483"> That's what he says ... the rights of women, blah blah blah ... </seg>
<seg id="484"> But for her, kind of, a character, mind. </seg>
<seg id="485"> Because he said "the principles he professes" and not "his principles." </seg>
<seg id="486"> I think I really liked the alliteration: "of the principles that profess." </seg>
<seg id="487"> I see! </seg>
<seg id="488"> He sold the soul for an all-match. </seg>
<seg id="489"> It is, I declare myself guilty. </seg>
<seg id="490"> Said among us, Thomas, you're a little dick. </seg>
<seg id="491"> If it allows, I would say that ... </seg>
<seg id="492"> She is better than a pagan. It seems to me a goddess. </seg>
<seg id="493"> - Really? And which? - Venus. </seg>
<seg id="494"> And is Vanda Venere, or am I kidding? </seg>
<seg id="495"> Is Venus who has taken human semblance to come to torment him? </seg>
<seg id="496"> Not exactly. </seg>
<seg id="497"> - Or rather not exactly. - Okay, there are! It's dull. </seg>
<seg id="498"> - She wants you to be ambivalent. - Ambiguo. - Yes, that one. </seg>
<seg id="499"> In reality, it is the story of "The Baccanti". </seg>
<seg id="500"> What was "The Baccanti"? </seg>
<seg id="501"> - It's a knife, do not you? - It's a very old pièce. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Citizens of Corinth. It is before you a Testiculus ... </seg>
<seg id="503"> ... but mortal cursed by gods for his offenses ... </seg>
<seg id="504"> ..and completely fucked up to the end of time. </seg>
<seg id="505"> - Is this a pie of this kind? - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="506"> Diòniso goes down to Earth and makes the arrogant king of Tebe ... </seg>
<seg id="507"> .. a tremula gelatin laden by a woman. - It would be exciting. </seg>
<seg id="508"> After that, the unleashed women of Tebe the Baccanti broke it. </seg>
<seg id="509"> And Diòniso came back to his house, triumphant. - I think I've seen her. </seg>
<seg id="510"> In our case, however, this is not about Diòniso but Aphrodite. </seg>
<seg id="511"> Who is it? </seg>
<seg id="512"> - It's the Greek version of Venus. - But it is the same person. </seg>
<seg id="513"> The same goddess. - Ave or Aphrodite! </seg>
<seg id="514"> Aye, oh Aphrodite. Are they so unbearably pedantic? </seg>
<seg id="515"> Yes, but I find it a nice thing. </seg>
<seg id="516"> Yup. </seg>
<seg id="517"> What are we doing? </seg>
<seg id="518"> It seems to me a goddess. </seg>
<seg id="519"> Really? And which? </seg>
<seg id="520"> Venus. </seg>
<seg id="521"> But Venus can only rule in a world of slaves. </seg>
<seg id="522"> Then it will be better for me to find one. </seg>
<seg id="523"> Would you like to be my slave, Herr Doktor Kushemski? </seg>
<seg id="524"> I am already. </seg>
<seg id="525"> I was depressed by his slaughter from the time he entered this room. </seg>
<seg id="526"> Have you already fallen in love with me? </seg>
<seg id="527"> Deeply. </seg>
<seg id="528"> I'm suffering as if I've known her forever. </seg>
<seg id="529"> - I'm sorry. - Get up straight away and get away from me. </seg>
<seg id="530"> I have to confess that it intrigues me. </seg>
<seg id="531"> I love her frankness and the clarity of her thoughts. </seg>
<seg id="532"> From a point of physical illness, she has charm, no doubt. </seg>
<seg id="533"> But if a man submits me, I sniff a trap ... </seg>
<seg id="534"> There are no traps. You love Me! </seg>
<seg id="535"> - You see? He has already begun to give orders. - Marry me. </seg>
<seg id="536"> I'm a naughty woman, Herr Kushemski. </seg>
<seg id="537"> To love me, she will have to give great courage. </seg>
<seg id="538"> - I've already explained my principles. - I do not care. </seg>
<seg id="539"> - I want my wife down. - She does not know anything about me. </seg>
<seg id="540"> - You dominate me. - Is absurd. </seg>
<seg id="541"> You give me complete power over me, for eternity. </seg>
<seg id="542"> Do me what you want. </seg>
<seg id="543"> - Dominate me, peep me if you want me. - This comes to me unexpected. </seg>
<seg id="544"> - Let's get that side. - Thing? </seg>
<seg id="545"> - He puts himself in the middle, bottom. - No, I'm fine here. </seg>
<seg id="546"> He would have to move there. </seg>
<seg id="547"> It takes power and puts itself in a position of power. </seg>
<seg id="548"> Recapture. </seg>
<seg id="549"> - This comes to me unexpected. - Yes. - Not good! </seg>
<seg id="550"> It does not die, I do. </seg>
<seg id="551"> You give me complete power over me for eternity, unconditionally. </seg>
<seg id="552"> Do me what you want. Dominate me. </seg>
<seg id="553"> I peek if you want. </seg>
<seg id="554"> - This comes to me unexpected. - She does not even pretend to smoke? </seg>
<seg id="555"> Want me to put me here, I put myself here. </seg>
<seg id="556"> And then it's just a hearing. </seg>
<seg id="557"> It is also a hearing to see if you accept to be direct. </seg>
<seg id="558"> Do what I say and stay there. </seg>
<seg id="559"> You give me complete power over me for eternity, unconditionally. </seg>
<seg id="560"> Do me what you want, dominate me. </seg>
<seg id="561"> - Peak if you want. - This comes to me unexpected. </seg>
<seg id="562"> - You're right, it's better. - Keep going. </seg>
<seg id="563"> What do you want in the depths of your heart? </seg>
<seg id="564"> To belong to her ... </seg>
<seg id="565"> ..compare in its sublime essence ... </seg>
<seg id="566"> ..discover and sneeze it ... </seg>
<seg id="567"> ..drug her stockings, put on her shoes ... </seg>
<seg id="568"> ..nothing more than my own. </seg>
<seg id="569"> And this she calls him love? - It's the only love we have. </seg>
<seg id="570"> In love, as in politics, only one of the parties must have power. </seg>
<seg id="571"> One must be the hammer and the other the anvil. </seg>
<seg id="572"> I agree that I am an anvil. </seg>
<seg id="573"> That's enough. </seg>
<seg id="574"> Keep it, I like it! </seg>
<seg id="575"> Thomas, but what intelligence, especially for women. </seg>
<seg id="576"> - You understand them by women. - Yes, yes ... years of studies. </seg>
<seg id="577"> - Where was I left? - She was an anvil. </seg>
<seg id="578"> Vanda, I'm looking for the pain and her pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="579"> Never let yourself be dominated by the feelings of others. </seg>
<seg id="580"> She uses her lover as he would serve her. </seg>
<seg id="581"> The domain, saves it like a lemon. </seg>
<seg id="582"> She is amazing. </seg>
<seg id="583"> If you do not want me as a husband, take me as a slave. </seg>
<seg id="584"> I deal with cruelty. </seg>
<seg id="585"> Why should I mistreat anyone who loves me? </seg>
<seg id="586"> - But I would love her even more. - I do not want to be worshiped. </seg>
<seg id="587"> All women want to be worshiped, like our Creator. </seg>
<seg id="588"> Create me! I ruin! It reduces me to nothing! </seg>
<seg id="589"> SELLING THE CELL </seg>
<seg id="590"> For a moment, excuse me. </seg>
<seg id="591"> Ready? Yup. </seg>
<seg id="592"> No, I have not left yet. </seg>
<seg id="593"> Everything is alright. </seg>
<seg id="594"> It's all right ... </seg>
<seg id="595"> I do not know. </seg>
<seg id="596"> The moment, huh? </seg>
<seg id="597"> Do I call you when I leave? </seg>
<seg id="598"> Yes, I too, my love. </seg>
<seg id="599"> - Yes, then ... Yes, all right. </seg>
<seg id="600"> Excuse me, huh? </seg>
<seg id="601"> For the hearing I do not know. </seg>
<seg id="602"> Now I'm at the temporary agency, maybe they have something. </seg>
<seg id="603"> As a typist, a nightmare in an important law firm. </seg>
<seg id="604"> The contract is for tomorrow. </seg>
<seg id="605"> I do not know! </seg>
<seg id="606"> Whatever will be, will be. </seg>
<seg id="607"> That's right, I'm sorry. </seg>
<seg id="608"> - Crazy! - His half? </seg>
<seg id="609"> Is that still said? - She says half today? </seg>
<seg id="610"> - Do not I know ... asshole? - Ah okay. </seg>
<seg id="611"> - Wondering why I lied? - No, I do not care. </seg>
<seg id="612"> How is that Vanda saying? </seg>
<seg id="613"> "I will not deny anything, I have other cats to fuck." </seg>
<seg id="614"> - Stupid way of saying. - She's the hammer, he's the anvil. </seg>
<seg id="615"> What I have to say? "Yes, dear, all you need"? </seg>
<seg id="616"> This has nothing to do with love, but with my ass. </seg>
<seg id="617"> And if he does, he must take the rest. </seg>
<seg id="618"> - That's what he's talking about. - Oh yes? </seg>
<seg id="619"> Do you play me? </seg>
<seg id="620"> - I do not know, do you believe it? - Stop doing it. </seg>
<seg id="621"> Can not one of you say what you think? </seg>
<seg id="622"> Talking with her is more complicated than dancing the tango. </seg>
<seg id="623"> Do not you want her to have a coffee? </seg>
<seg id="624"> Why, what is it? </seg>
<seg id="625"> - Are you dying? - Absolutely not! </seg>
<seg id="626"> I'm just offering her a coffee. </seg>
<seg id="627"> - Is it a symbolic coffee? - No, it's a coffee. </seg>
<seg id="628"> What would his wife say if she wanted to offer me a "no coffee"? </seg>
<seg id="629"> - I'm not married. - Ma νa? </seg>
<seg id="630"> I guess so soon on the phone. </seg>
<seg id="631"> - He was my girlfriend. - It's the same. </seg>
<seg id="632"> What would you think? In an interview he said: </seg>
<seg id="633"> "The theater is the best way to get girls in bed". </seg>
<seg id="634"> Do not tell me she read that stuff. </seg>
<seg id="635"> I was young, it was my first interview. </seg>
<seg id="636"> - Have you ever been married? - Never. </seg>
<seg id="637"> - And she still lives with her mother? - I'm strange but not so much. </seg>
<seg id="638"> Is your fur going to pass his passion? </seg>
<seg id="639"> - No, it's love. - She's strangely funny. </seg>
<seg id="640"> And my wife must be my muse. </seg>
<seg id="641"> So your girlfriend has a pair of wings and everything else? </seg>
<seg id="642"> In love you have to launch completely. </seg>
<seg id="643"> And she dives. - I swear to fish ... </seg>
<seg id="644"> With fireworks, dizziness and thunder. </seg>
<seg id="645"> Coffee yes or no coffee? </seg>
<seg id="646"> I conceive of giving myself to a man for the sake of losing his slave. </seg>
<seg id="647"> I would say that we are not compatible at all, Herr Kushemski. </seg>
<seg id="648"> We will annul ourselves. </seg>
<seg id="649"> And I'd say we're done for each other. </seg>
<seg id="650"> Is not that what you hear, Vanda? Is not that what you hear too? </seg>
<seg id="651"> I offer you a try, a contract like a business. </seg>
<seg id="652"> It will take a year to prove to me that it is the man I need. </seg>
<seg id="653"> - One year is long. - I have not finished yet. </seg>
<seg id="654"> - Please forgive me. - You will be my slave for a year. </seg>
<seg id="655"> So do not do anything! </seg>
<seg id="656"> Awaits everything before entering. </seg>
<seg id="657"> - She believes? - Stop doing the naive. </seg>
<seg id="658"> - She is the author. - I'm not sure he has prepared everything. </seg>
<seg id="659"> And I'm honest, I swear. </seg>
<seg id="660"> So is he kidding? It is ambivalent. </seg>
<seg id="661"> - Ambiguo. - Yes, yes. </seg>
<seg id="662"> Or he's a lazy bitch, ready for anything to enjoy. </seg>
<seg id="663"> A lazy bitch? Have not you ever thought about her like that. </seg>
<seg id="664"> It can be even more complicated. </seg>
<seg id="665"> "Be my slave for a year and then I'll fuck you." </seg>
<seg id="666"> - It's always ambivalent, do not you? - Ambiguo. </seg>
<seg id="667"> - Ambiguo. - From my point of departure, indeed from that of Kushemski ... </seg>
<seg id="668"> ..would be his last chance. Maybe even the only one. </seg>
<seg id="669"> And to do that? </seg>
<seg id="670"> - Of νiνere. - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="671"> He loves whiplashes and wants to know if he likes it too. </seg>
<seg id="672"> - She makes a hearing. - She also makes a hearing with him. </seg>
<seg id="673"> He is a weird and she is an object like all the women of 1800. </seg>
<seg id="674"> What's up? </seg>
<seg id="675"> So who are you, Frau Vanda Jourdain? </seg>
<seg id="676"> - I'm a pagan. - No, I'm serious. </seg>
<seg id="677"> It starts to move on. </seg>
<seg id="678"> Where does it come from? What's his story about? </seg>
<seg id="679"> Military Daughter, grown up around, I have no tenderness. </seg>
<seg id="680"> Have you been? In which city? Ίn which countries? </seg>
<seg id="681"> I will make a contract whereby you agree that you will be my slave for a year. </seg>
<seg id="682"> - I'll be in your orders. - It's a deal. </seg>
<seg id="683"> They swap a handshake. </seg>
<seg id="684"> - There is a Greek officer in the hotel. A Greek? - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="685"> It comes from Athens. </seg>
<seg id="686"> She has a white stallion like her and she has black leather stitches. </seg>
<seg id="687"> I want you to get my room number. </seg>
<seg id="688"> - But, Vanda ... What is it? </seg>
<seg id="689"> Are you already reluctant? - Please forgive me. </seg>
<seg id="690"> Tomorrow you will be waiting for me in the birch forest, and at the statue of Aphrodite. </seg>
<seg id="691"> - At what time? You will wait until the moment I decide to quit. </seg>
<seg id="692"> - Very well. - Do not show up without the Greek Chamber Number. </seg>
<seg id="693"> And now, kiss my foot. </seg>
<seg id="694"> And he kneels and kisses his foot. </seg>
<seg id="695"> I love this part, it is very straightforward. </seg>
<seg id="696"> Pass me the fur now. </seg>
<seg id="697"> Séäin, how's it going to end? </seg>
<seg id="698"> This only depends on you, Frau Vanda νon Dunayeν, and not from me. </seg>
<seg id="699"> Thank you for coffee, slave. </seg>
<seg id="700"> Yes, I would be right now. A coffee I mean. </seg>
<seg id="701"> It was intense. The handshake was electric. </seg>
<seg id="702"> The happiness of an era when people were more introverted. </seg>
<seg id="703"> A simple confusion had already left eroticism. </seg>
<seg id="704"> The conversation. The only thing to put under your teeth. </seg>
<seg id="705"> The book does not start that way, do not you? </seg>
<seg id="706"> - The book? - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="707"> The beginning scene is over ... </seg>
<seg id="708"> When does Venus look naked in his fur at the fireplace? </seg>
<seg id="709"> - Did you read "Furry Venus"? - I gave him a look. </seg>
<seg id="710"> When he said he did not know what it was about, he lied. </seg>
<seg id="711"> I took a little advantage. </seg>
<seg id="712"> - Why did not she take that scene? - I did not know how to use it. </seg>
<seg id="713"> Just put it at the beginning, kind before meeting with Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="714"> You can not think of making "Venus in Fur" without Venus. </seg>
<seg id="715"> And she can use the same actress for Vanda and Venus. </seg>
<seg id="716"> - Naked in the scene? No problem. - Yes, I'll think about it. </seg>
<seg id="717"> - Why do not we impoverish? She'll give you ideas. - And how? </seg>
<seg id="718"> You have to change the lights. </seg>
<seg id="719"> - Are we at the top of the pièce? - In the room of Kushemski ... </seg>
<seg id="720"> ..in the middle of the night. </seg>
<seg id="721"> Okay, heart of night, two in the morning. </seg>
<seg id="722"> We laugh a bit ... </seg>
<seg id="723"> Fire in the fireplace, garden side. </seg>
<seg id="724"> Yes, very good. </seg>
<seg id="725"> What is Kushemski doing? </seg>
<seg id="726"> - I do not know. - What a fantasy! </seg>
<seg id="727"> Too much discount? </seg>
<seg id="728"> He is also reading when he meets Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="729"> He can not even read at the beginning, we are not in the library. </seg>
<seg id="730"> Maybe he could write his diary. </seg>
<seg id="731"> I like this. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Yup. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Then I'm Venus. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Who cares! </seg>
<seg id="735"> Do as if I were naked. Are you trying with me? </seg>
<seg id="736"> Imagine being a girlfriend and sudden. </seg>
<seg id="737"> - Ah, it's the first I have to do. - All the girls say. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Yeah, but for me it's the little thing. </seg>
<seg id="739"> The fire in the fireplace burns, we see Venus naked ... </seg>
<seg id="740"> ... lazily in a fur ... </seg>
<seg id="741"> Strength, I'm in the fur. </seg>
<seg id="742"> She is the director. </seg>
<seg id="743"> I said "leave it". </seg>
<seg id="744"> Now let's go to scrijevania. </seg>
<seg id="745"> Give him the character. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Scriava on her diary. </seg>
<seg id="747"> - She screams. - I'm doing. </seg>
<seg id="748"> But at high waits, we're at the theater! If not how do we know who it is? </seg>
<seg id="749"> We are at the beginning of the pièce. </seg>
<seg id="750"> The scene lights up little by little ... </seg>
<seg id="751"> .. we hear the tic tac of a spade pendulum. </seg>
<seg id="752"> Tic tac ... </seg>
<seg id="753"> ..tic tac ... </seg>
<seg id="754"> ..tic tac ... </seg>
<seg id="755"> ..tic tac! </seg>
<seg id="757"> Two in the morning. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Stay in a spa ... </seg>
<seg id="759"> Surrounded by forests and mountains. </seg>
<seg id="760"> It is a moonless night, darkness and silence reign. </seg>
<seg id="761"> VANDA FITTING A moment! I hear a sparrow. </seg>
<seg id="762"> - A nightingale. - A nightingale. </seg>
<seg id="763"> VANDA MLAGOLA </seg>
<seg id="764"> And the calling of a cat in heat. </seg>
<seg id="765"> I feel tremendously only ... </seg>
<seg id="766"> ... happy, dissatisfied. </seg>
<seg id="767"> (In German) Good evening. </seg>
<seg id="768"> Well, did the Germans want us another? </seg>
<seg id="769"> I hope not to bother. </seg>
<seg id="770"> Absolutely not. </seg>
<seg id="771"> Aye, Aphrodite. </seg>
<seg id="772"> - So you did not forget me! - Forget about you? </seg>
<seg id="773"> My dearest and worst enemy? </seg>
<seg id="774"> - You're too kind. - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="775"> Do I have a right to a small kiss? </seg>
<seg id="776"> - That's better, but Thomas ... - Oh! - Did I say Thomas? Ooops! </seg>
<seg id="777"> It's so cool in here! </seg>
<seg id="778"> Everyone who wants to find you, I get cold. </seg>
<seg id="779"> STARNUTLSCE See? </seg>
<seg id="780"> I already have inflammatory bronchi. </seg>
<seg id="781"> If you do not spend the time walking all naked ... </seg>
<seg id="782"> But I'm Venus, I have to be naked. </seg>
<seg id="783"> It's part of the laVoro. </seg>
<seg id="784"> Do not you want to take away those ruinous rumors and come close to me? </seg>
<seg id="785"> There is so much place here under my fur. </seg>
<seg id="786"> No thanks. </seg>
<seg id="787"> I brought this for you, directly from the Olympus. </seg>
<seg id="788"> It's Daddy! </seg>
<seg id="789"> - Do not you see the label? Made in Olimpo. Because? </seg>
<seg id="790"> Why would I be interested in yours? </seg>
<seg id="791"> I know your little foul. </seg>
<seg id="792"> Women are not interested in you. </seg>
<seg id="793"> You are interested in their fur, you should marry an ottoman. </seg>
<seg id="794"> I'd better understand it with an otters than with a woman. </seg>
<seg id="795"> But if I put my legs under my waist ... </seg>
<seg id="796"> Would you like a little love? </seg>
<seg id="797"> Is it a bit of love you suggest to me? </seg>
<seg id="798"> No, it's the power you care about. </seg>
<seg id="799"> - Do you resist me? - Yes, yes. </seg>
<seg id="800"> Séférin, I want you on the floor, at my feet. </seg>
<seg id="801"> - You'll suppl. - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="802"> You already belong to me and you will belong to me until the end of time. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - Yeah. - (in German) Arriead. </seg>
<seg id="804"> I'll be back. </seg>
<seg id="805"> And then, puff, disappears. </seg>
<seg id="806"> Wow! - Mica male, eh? </seg>
<seg id="807"> - Yeah, no ... - She could scribble her and put her in the pièce. </seg>
<seg id="808"> Here, so to speak, yes. </seg>
<seg id="809"> - In this view ... - It's a little bit of a stress on Dietrich. </seg>
<seg id="810"> Yes, it works very well. </seg>
<seg id="811"> And then he gives a picture of Kushemski. </seg>
<seg id="812"> Yes, in the middle of the night is there that makes it difficult with Venus ... </seg>
<seg id="813"> And then the next morning with Vanda: "Do me yours, I beg you." </seg>
<seg id="814"> We could end by lowering the lights ... </seg>
<seg id="815"> .. and then when we get up there is morning, toc toc ... </seg>
<seg id="816"> Here comes Venus re-emerged from Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="817"> - For revenge. - But yes, it's great! </seg>
<seg id="818"> So is she you? - Thing? </seg>
<seg id="819"> Him and her? </seg>
<seg id="820"> Kushemski - Noavacek, Noavacek - Kushemski. </seg>
<seg id="821"> - No, it's not me. She said there's a lot of her there in there. </seg>
<seg id="822"> Then maybe she is Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="823"> - The pièce has nothing to do with me. - Of course, she's just the author. </seg>
<seg id="824"> Ops, the adapter. </seg>
<seg id="825"> Type: "If a critic says this is me, I kill him." </seg>
<seg id="826"> - Will I have the right to persuade the characters? - Sure. </seg>
<seg id="827"> Looks like you've come across the characters of a sadomaso novel. </seg>
<seg id="828"> No, it's a famous book and I ... </seg>
<seg id="829"> Have not experienced his "unforeseen time" at the age of twelve? </seg>
<seg id="830"> - No. - In library ... </seg>
<seg id="831"> - No! - With a cat. </seg>
<seg id="832"> No. </seg>
<seg id="833"> Is he still waiting for his "big time"? </seg>
<seg id="834"> I'm not expecting anything! </seg>
<seg id="835"> I find that the relationship between the two characters is fascinating, complex. </seg>
<seg id="836"> - Of course! - I love the emotional depth of the characters. </seg>
<seg id="837"> There is no such thing nowadays. </seg>
<seg id="838"> You no longer hate this kind of anger today. </seg>
<seg id="839"> - Let me introduce some of my friends. - Okay. </seg>
<seg id="840"> Very well, then I do not understand a good accident. </seg>
<seg id="841"> When he comes home, does his girlfriend not tie her to bed to frustrate her? </seg>
<seg id="842"> No. </seg>
<seg id="843"> She should ask him so much to see if the girlfriend is available. </seg>
<seg id="844"> - Stop calling her "the girlfriend." - Excuse me. </seg>
<seg id="845"> What do you think of the pièce its half? </seg>
<seg id="846"> - You do not like him very much. - You will have to be afraid that you say it is ìi. </seg>
<seg id="847"> It's not about us. </seg>
<seg id="848"> Let me tell you about her ... </seg>
<seg id="849"> Marie-Cécile. </seg>
<seg id="850"> I bet it's more fun than her. </seg>
<seg id="851"> Good extraction. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Surely she grew up in a beautiful family home in the province. </seg>
<seg id="853"> - From the parts of La Baule? - Nantes, actually. </seg>
<seg id="854"> But I bet her family spent the weekends at La Baule ... </seg>
<seg id="855"> In a beautiful garden yard. </seg>
<seg id="856"> Practice it laughs and loves the seafood. </seg>
<seg id="857"> Yes, it is not. </seg>
<seg id="858"> It is high, slightly authoritarian, but without being sided. </seg>
<seg id="859"> Deep-haired hair ... </seg>
<seg id="860"> ..longs legs and a nice pair ... </seg>
<seg id="861"> Eyes. </seg>
<seg id="862"> A mind of all respect. </seg>
<seg id="863"> He did the preparatory school in Paris, or Louis Le Grand. </seg>
<seg id="864"> Do I have a lot of mistakes? </seg>
<seg id="865"> Henry IV, School of Economics. - And she has a doctorate. </seg>
<seg id="866"> - He's finishing his thesis in sociology. - He has a dog? </seg>
<seg id="867"> Let's see a little ... I would say a labrador. </seg>
<seg id="868"> Is called... </seg>
<seg id="869"> It has an unusual name that makes a little intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="870"> - Bourdieu? - He'll go. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Culture is not lacking, I see. </seg>
<seg id="872"> I bet it's rich in breakthrough ... </seg>
<seg id="873"> Even if a tearful theater and a Belgian cactus ... </seg>
<seg id="874"> ... does not exactly Comédie Française. </seg>
<seg id="875"> No, there is family grain. Am I right? </seg>
<seg id="876"> Of course I say good. </seg>
<seg id="877"> But she is the artist and this in Marie-Cécile is losing her head ... </seg>
<seg id="878"> .. along with her sensitivity. </seg>
<seg id="879"> She is the first man she met ... </seg>
<seg id="880"> .. who has a feeling of being. </seg>
<seg id="881"> He loves books, opera, ballet, things like that. </seg>
<seg id="882"> In the evening, look at Arté and talk about the last Goncourt ... </seg>
<seg id="883"> .. and then do a quiet fuck. </seg>
<seg id="884"> Nothing is better than a quiet spit to relax. </seg>
<seg id="885"> But there's a rumor that rumors her head ... </seg>
<seg id="886"> He asks you to claim other things. </seg>
<seg id="887"> I do not know what it is, but it bumps. </seg>
<seg id="888"> Bum. </seg>
<seg id="889"> Bum. </seg>
<seg id="890"> Bum. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Meanwhile, Thomas is happy. </seg>
<seg id="892"> The girls are very well ... </seg>
<seg id="893"> .. and you'll spend a quiet night watching Arté ... </seg>
<seg id="894"> .. and to talk about the last Goncourt. </seg>
<seg id="895"> You will have children who will just like you and then you will die. </seg>
<seg id="896"> Do we keep reading? </seg>
<seg id="897"> Yes, we continue. </seg>
<seg id="898"> The next day's meeting in the birch forest? - All right. </seg>
<seg id="899"> We pretend it's the statue of Venus. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Aye, Aphrodite. </seg>
<seg id="901"> A, Aphrodite ... </seg>
<seg id="902"> Do we hesitate to read the text? </seg>
<seg id="903"> Well, Séerd. </seg>
<seg id="904"> No, no, that's fine. </seg>
<seg id="905"> All these stories of slavery and domination ... </seg>
<seg id="906"> She has corrupted me with all these speeches. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I'm convinced that she would love to dominate a man. </seg>
<seg id="908"> - No. - Maybe even torture him. </seg>
<seg id="909"> - No. - He admits it. </seg>
<seg id="910"> It's not from me. </seg>
<seg id="911"> - How can I reason? - The devil is the reason! </seg>
<seg id="912"> Séäin, you do not understand? </seg>
<seg id="913"> She will never be safe in the hands of a woman ... </seg>
<seg id="914"> ..what she is. </seg>
<seg id="915"> But this joke is sexist. I want to scream! </seg>
<seg id="916"> What is sexist? </seg>
<seg id="917"> "She will never be safe in the hands of a woman." </seg>
<seg id="918"> - But it's in the book ... - It does not change anything. </seg>
<seg id="919"> - The book is sexist. - The book is not sexist. </seg>
<seg id="920"> - On the contrary, it's something ... - A classic of world literature. </seg>
<seg id="921"> - Are you saying this? - Not exactly. </seg>
<seg id="922"> And this? </seg>
<seg id="923"> We do not have a Titian here, my dear. </seg>
<seg id="924"> - It's a pretty sadmouth porn. - But what ...? </seg>
<seg id="925"> - This story is nothing but a big cliché. - And why? </seg>
<seg id="926"> Is one spanked and suddenly loves to whip it? </seg>
<seg id="927"> - That's what happened to the author. - And it happened to her too? - No! </seg>
<seg id="928"> So what do you know? </seg>
<seg id="929"> For me it is a piece of two people that are united for eternity. </seg>
<seg id="930"> Their hearts are handcuffed to each other. </seg>
<seg id="931"> - Handled in perversion. - No, handcuffed in passion. </seg>
<seg id="932"> - Yes, but his passion! - It's chemical ... </seg>
<seg id="933"> .. is the meeting of two people who give fire to the polveri. </seg>
<seg id="934"> This is a fight of the sexes, of classes. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Vanda is an innocent woman who faces a pervert. </seg>
<seg id="936"> - But then he does not understand anything! - Vanda says: "She has corrupted me!" </seg>
<seg id="937"> And if the thirst for domination had sunk in her? </seg>
<seg id="938"> Had Kushemski been awakened? </seg>
<seg id="939"> What if she was just a woman? </seg>
<seg id="940"> This text looks like an Austrian misogyny brochure. </seg>
<seg id="941"> He obliges him to play a power and puts him in charge. </seg>
<seg id="942"> - That's not so. - That's right. </seg>
<seg id="943"> - And how? - You think in the end. - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Vanda tells the Greek to whip it ... </seg>
<seg id="945"> .. then leave Kushemski there with his cock in his hand ... </seg>
<seg id="946"> .. and would it be his fault even if he was to defeat him? </seg>
<seg id="947"> No, I think the little Kushemski has the potions for the Greek. </seg>
<seg id="948"> I wonder how it can be bitten up to this point. </seg>
<seg id="949"> How can Vanda interpret it so well ... </seg>
<seg id="950"> ..but be banged up to this point? </seg>
<seg id="951"> Fucking actress fucking! </seg>
<seg id="952"> That bastards! </seg>
<seg id="953"> Fuck! </seg>
<seg id="954"> - I'm sorry. - Excuse me? </seg>
<seg id="955"> I'm sorry, I was dragged. </seg>
<seg id="956"> Yes, but what is said is said. </seg>
<seg id="957"> We say that the meaning of pièce is "beware of your desires" </seg>
<seg id="958"> Since she could knock on her door ... </seg>
<seg id="959"> .. do not take a goddam her ass: here is the argument of the pièce ... </seg>
<seg id="960"> ..just saying. </seg>
<seg id="961"> Just saying. </seg>
<seg id="962"> What is the modern way of saying "so to speak"? </seg>
<seg id="963"> "Guy". </seg>
<seg id="964"> If she says it. </seg>
<seg id="965"> Much worse than the goddesses do not exist otherwise she would be in the shit. </seg>
<seg id="966"> All right, he's right. </seg>
<seg id="967"> All he says is okay. </seg>
<seg id="968"> Can we ... can we continue? </seg>
<seg id="969"> For fate, Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="970"> Do not you understand that you will never be safe in a woman's hands? </seg>
<seg id="971"> Whoever she is. </seg>
<seg id="972"> We are two avenues, Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="973"> We explore the limits of human nature. </seg>
<seg id="974"> She is sick. </seg>
<seg id="975"> It was denied by the countess, now its effects are affected. </seg>
<seg id="976"> - But she loves the effects like me. - Well ... </seg>
<seg id="977"> - He likes to have complete power over me. - No. </seg>
<seg id="978"> His desires will be orders. </seg>
<seg id="979"> I would supplant it, I would strike at her feet. </seg>
<seg id="980"> Do me what you want. </seg>
<seg id="981"> You are a crazy, a fanatic. </seg>
<seg id="982"> He is willing to do anything to accomplish his dream. </seg>
<seg id="983"> - But my dream is you. - Get away from me, Sérecier. </seg>
<seg id="984"> Before it's too late. </seg>
<seg id="985"> - She loves Me? - I do not know. </seg>
<seg id="986"> Decide, do something to convince her. </seg>
<seg id="987"> - And how? - Do what everyone loves. </seg>
<seg id="988"> - Let me suffer. - This disgusts me. </seg>
<seg id="989"> And I did not pretend to pretend. </seg>
<seg id="990"> I'm not the countess, her aunt. I am myself. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Repeat the challenge, challenges. </seg>
<seg id="992"> I'm not the countess, her aunt. I am myself. </seg>
<seg id="993"> - Still, get angry! - What do you want from me, Thomas? </seg>
<seg id="994"> I'm not her aunt fucking, I'm me! What do you want? </seg>
<seg id="995"> - I do not know. - At this time it is no longer a matter of pièce. </seg>
<seg id="996"> - I want a lot more. - But I'm not her. </seg>
<seg id="997"> I'm just a little bitch who needs to laurel. </seg>
<seg id="998"> And I'm not her aunt, I'm me. That's right? </seg>
<seg id="999"> Yes, that's fine. Very well. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> I can not do this part. It's too hard. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> Do not be afraid, for a lieutenant. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> Say "I beg you". </seg>
<seg id="1003"> I beg you. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> - She's awful. - I'm completely in his power. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> Lieutenant, you're not in my power, I'm in his hands. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> He says he is my slave but she is the one who dominates me. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> - Is not that right? - Thing? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> He does not stop saying that she has the power but he has it. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> The more he submits the more domination. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> It's complex, yes. </seg>
<seg id="1011"> Here is the contract we talked about. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> She determines that she agrees to make the most total submissive. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> It will be my slave. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> He will completely renounce his identity. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> His body, his soul, his honor will belong to me. </seg>
<seg id="1016"> Forever. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> Sign in at the bottom. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> Well? </seg>
<seg id="1019"> I believe my commitment would last a year. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> - Do you want to dictate my conditions? - Can I re-read the contract? </seg>
<seg id="1021"> Why, do not you trust me maybe? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Sign. </seg>
<seg id="1023"> Good. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> From now on you will call me lady ... </seg>
<seg id="1025"> .. and you will only speak when I will authorize you. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> You will serve me meals and wait for my orders in the corridor. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> In the morning you will be victorious and you will fall in the evening. </seg>
<seg id="1028"> I'll poke your stockings and put on your shoes. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> - I'll call you Thomas. - It's Gregoir in the text. </seg>
<seg id="1030"> I changed it. From now on, I'll call you Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> You will wear the diya's home with my coat of arms. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> - How much gentleman ... - Keep the word out. </seg>
<seg id="1033"> Did not you sign a contract to make sure you're my slave? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> - Your slave but not your servant. - The difference escapes me. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> - Is this a game? - That's what I am. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> I'm stubborn, νolitiνa, cpup ... </seg>
<seg id="1037"> .. and when I start something, I get to the bottom. </seg>
<seg id="1038"> The more I resist, the more I stubborn. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> But in the deep, his nature is noble. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> What do you know of my nature aside what you think you know? </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Please apologize, I was spared. </seg>
<seg id="1042"> Give me your passport and your money. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> - But ... - Give it to me! </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Tomorrow we leave for Florence. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> I'll fly it first class, you're in the third place. </seg>
<seg id="1046"> - Third class? - You will eat and sleep with the servants. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> - What is it, Thomas? - Will this end us in the end? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> At the end? We did not even begin. </seg>
<seg id="1049"> But Vanda, I ... </seg>
<seg id="1050"> She slapped him ... </seg>
<seg id="1051"> ..o bacia ... </seg>
<seg id="1052"> He caresses his cheek ... </seg>
<seg id="1053"> Did I hurt you, my dear? </seg>
<seg id="1054"> Yes, deliciously bad. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> Good. </seg>
<seg id="1056"> What did you know about the beautiful Greek? </seg>
<seg id="1057"> It's called Alexis, it's a count. </seg>
<seg id="1058"> - It's nice, do not you find it? - Oh, it's fascinating. </seg>
<seg id="1059"> I say that Kushemski had a cook for him. </seg>
<seg id="1060"> I have to take a stage next to her at work tonight. </seg>
<seg id="1061"> I will allow Count Alexis to seduce me. </seg>
<seg id="1062"> Ah, but Vanda ... </seg>
<seg id="1063"> What's up? Am I not free to do what I'm up to? </seg>
<seg id="1064"> - She excites me. - Silence, dog! </seg>
<seg id="1065"> Bring me a birch bark. </seg>
<seg id="1066"> He brings them one ... </seg>
<seg id="1067"> Do you hear this hiss? </seg>
<seg id="1068"> This sound makes my nerves like a diapason. </seg>
<seg id="1069"> I just have a desire: to hear you groan under the blows. </seg>
<seg id="1070"> Listen to Herr Doktor Kushemski who begs me ... </seg>
<seg id="1071"> .. she cries like a little girl, my heart falls in my chest. </seg>
<seg id="1072"> The air is glowing. </seg>
<seg id="1073"> What have you done? What have you done? Bla bla bla bla bla bla! </seg>
<seg id="1074"> Come bla bla bla? Ίn what sense? </seg>
<seg id="1075"> Vanda turns into witch cattiвa. </seg>
<seg id="1076"> The incandescent air, my nerves are a diapason ... </seg>
<seg id="1077"> Let's put some picks and drum rollers out there. </seg>
<seg id="1078"> Tom, she likes me so much. </seg>
<seg id="1079"> I like it so much, but this is already alive and rejuvenated. </seg>
<seg id="1080"> How do you mean? </seg>
<seg id="1081"> The pièce is ... my pièce! </seg>
<seg id="1082"> It's an extraordinary work and nobody will make me change my mind. </seg>
<seg id="1083"> Pity of misery! </seg>
<seg id="1084"> She does not know anything ... </seg>
<seg id="1085"> I do not believe it, I refuse to demolish my laojo ... </seg>
<seg id="1086"> ..what you say in the pièce or not! Go get her ass. </seg>
<seg id="1087"> Okay, she decides. </seg>
<seg id="1088"> She takes a knife and puts it in her throat. </seg>
<seg id="1089"> God I hate you. </seg>
<seg id="1090"> What does he do? What happens? </seg>
<seg id="1091"> Do you think he does not understand your game? </seg>
<seg id="1092"> You think I can use, to subdue me ... </seg>
<seg id="1093"> I do not want anything like that, I swear it. </seg>
<seg id="1094"> If you knew how delicious this feeling is. </seg>
<seg id="1095"> Do you know what I say? </seg>
<seg id="1096"> I will go to Laavora Tribunal ... </seg>
<seg id="1097"> ... because he has not yet decided if I have any part. </seg>
<seg id="1098"> - I'd love to give you the party. - That's what he says right now. </seg>
<seg id="1099"> Can you put it in writing? SELLING THE CELL </seg>
<seg id="1100"> Wait, excuse me. </seg>
<seg id="1101"> - Yup? - Shut up, Marie-Cécile! </seg>
<seg id="1102"> No, I'm still here. </seg>
<seg id="1103"> - I have some things to finish. - She's fucking me! </seg>
<seg id="1104"> I bend to four feet on the stage. - Soon. </seg>
<seg id="1105"> It fucks me like a labrador in heat! </seg>
<seg id="1106"> You start eating without me, then I get it. </seg>
<seg id="1107"> Okay. But is not she a little lame lamb shaven yesterday? </seg>
<seg id="1108"> I'll call you when I get out and then ... Then, yes. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> Yes, that's fine. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> I do not know. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> I'll be back when I'm back, okay? </seg>
<seg id="1112"> Fuck you. Hello. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> - Sorry. - There was no one on the other side, did not they? </seg>
<seg id="1114"> As? - Face to face. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> - Talk to someone. - I spoke with my half. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> - And who is this guy? - Who says she's a guy? </seg>
<seg id="1117"> And why did he pretend? </seg>
<seg id="1118"> In your opinion? </seg>
<seg id="1119"> I think I did not like that I answered the phone. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> Type "Female Nurse"? Or something like that? </seg>
<seg id="1121"> Something like this, yes. </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Any other director would have jumped on me. </seg>
<seg id="1123"> - I'm not "any other director". - Bullshit. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> If he thought he could do it, he would already have done it. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> It is not. </seg>
<seg id="1126"> Even if I allowed it? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> How do you know all those things of Marie-Cécile? </seg>
<seg id="1128"> I met him in the gym. - But look at it a bit! </seg>
<seg id="1129"> Avaea the air very nice and then it is really beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> We were talking as we moved in the locker room ... </seg>
<seg id="1131"> ... series of "talking between girls". </seg>
<seg id="1132"> I told her I'm an actress ... </seg>
<seg id="1133"> I'm also doing the detectives I'm trying to recycle. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> And she tells me about her boyfriend. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> A very mysterious type, a writer. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> He gives me some money to inquire about him ... </seg>
<seg id="1137"> ... to find out who he is, if he loves him seriously, things like that. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> Prematurely information ... </seg>
<seg id="1139"> ... with criminal record and financial situation. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> I have to meet her later in a hotel ... </seg>
<seg id="1141"> ... for a complete account. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> He has a beautiful body, huh? Congratulations. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> She is amazing! </seg>
<seg id="1144"> - When a man tells me so much a trap. - Touché. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> - Marie-Cécile does not shower in the gym. - Oh, no? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> Yet it was wet. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> We finish? </seg>
<seg id="1148"> Yup. </seg>

<seg id="1159"> Yes, yes chic! </seg>
<seg id="1160"> Cherry on the cake. </seg>
<seg id="1161"> - You liked it? "It is very nice, ma'am. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> I could almost fall in love with you when I was with you. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> "Almost fall in love"? This means you do not love me! </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I'm bored, whining constantly. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> Is the Count? And he? </seg>
<seg id="1166"> Are you in love with him? </seg>
<seg id="1167"> He followed me to Florence! </seg>
<seg id="1168"> He does not love her. He wants you, how he wanted a thousand others. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> Insolent breed. How dare you speak with that tone? </seg>

<seg id="1211"> I do not punish you enough, here's the problem. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> Just when they have to take you in your arms. </seg>

<seg id="1224"> - I do not want to, I refuse. - I apologize? </seg>
<seg id="1225"> - I wrote her a letter. - A letter? </seg>
<seg id="1226"> A goodbye letter, maybe. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> Is the degradation that you've been forced to make is already unbearable? </seg>
<seg id="1228"> The degradation that we ... </seg>
<seg id="1229"> I can not recite this passage. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> - I do not understand what's happening. - How would that be? </seg>
<seg id="1231"> Yet it's fairly clear. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> What do I have to do? In your head how do you spell the scene? </seg>
<seg id="1233"> But is the time when ... What was the joke? </seg>
<seg id="1234"> - "I wrote a letter to you." - A letter... </seg>
<seg id="1235"> A goodbye letter, maybe? </seg>
<seg id="1236"> - The degradation you deserve ... - Give it a little. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> Is the degradation that I have been forced to make you unbearable? </seg>
<seg id="1238"> Have to hear her on a few days ... </seg>
<seg id="1239"> I will be afraid to show you. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> Then? Doν'è? </seg>
<seg id="1241"> Show me this captain. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> A bit of veneration would not hurt me. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> That's fine, Tom. You are strong. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> You should do Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> No, no ... </seg>
<seg id="1246"> But yes! </seg>
<seg id="1247"> Have to be Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> You understand his character better than me, you created it ... </seg>
<seg id="1249"> You know her intimately. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> - But I do not know his jokes. - Yes you know. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> - Be careful, Séverin. - I do my best, master. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> But as usual, your best is not up to you. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> - Take my fur. - Yes, my lord. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> She prepares a bottle of champagne and two cocktails. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> Count Alexander Alexis will come from moment to moment. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> - But master ... - If you do not mind, you can leave. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> Far from my drive. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> His fur, mistress. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> Will Count Alexis marry you, mistress? </seg>
<seg id="1260"> I will not lie anymore, Sérecier. That man makes me tremble. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> Great! </seg>
<seg id="1262"> Wait! </seg>
<seg id="1263"> Sit down. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> I live in my thoughts, I can not throw it away. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> I live in my thoughts, I can not throw it away. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> - It makes me suffer. - You are great. </seg>
<seg id="1267"> - Yet I love this suffering. - Get up and stay a bit more. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> If he asks me to sue his wife, I'll say yes. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> You're magic. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Do you know he is very jealous of you? </seg>
<seg id="1271"> I told him everything about us two. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> And he probably threatened to kill her. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> In the effects ... </seg>
<seg id="1274"> - Count you hit her? Yup. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> - Did you let her go? Yes and it was sublime. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> More intense. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> - Yes and it was sublime. - Even more intense. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> - Blow it in your face. - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> And it was sublime. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> - Oh! - I'll kill you, both of you. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> I will tear your heart, throw it to the dogs! </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Let her be damned! </seg>
<seg id="1283"> - Damn it! Yeah, I'm killing Sérecier! </seg>
<seg id="1284"> I can not do this comedy anymore. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> Which comedy? </seg>
<seg id="1286"> But how does he love me? I was terrible with her. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> I did everything to get her out ... </seg>
<seg id="1288"> To heal it, to show you how much I love it. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> Was there nothing wrong with it? </seg>
<seg id="1290"> Anything. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Was it just a game? A recital? And the contract? </seg>
<seg id="1292"> Oh, the contract ... </seg>
<seg id="1293"> My little, tender, silly ... </seg>
<seg id="1294"> Séäin, I loved her from the first moment. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> I can not tell you why I'm not who she believes. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I'm weak, I'm lost ... do not you understand? </seg>
<seg id="1297"> Not bad. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> It's me that I should be submissive. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> It's me that I should be frustrated and tied up. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> I think I'll tie you to the statue with a pair of your socks. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> It's what you want, do not you? - Yes, I beg you. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> Do me what you want. </seg>

<seg id="1310"> Very well, Tom. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> It's okay. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> Is fantastic. But do you know what the problem is? </seg>
<seg id="1313"> Whatever we say, or do, this piece is degrading. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> It's an insult to women. It's pornography. </seg>

<seg id="1"> It was the phenomenon of the 1920s. </seg>
<seg id="2"> If you think that at the time it was as famous as Lindbergh ... it's really sophisticated. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Its history reflects the nature of our civilization ... the character of our times. Yet it is also the story of a man ... and there are all the issues of our culture ... heroism, will, things like these ... </seg>
<seg id="4"> but when one thinks about it, it was really weird. </seg>
<seg id="5"> It is ironic to see ... how quickly it has vanished from our memory ... considering the impressive record he had established. </seg>
<seg id="6"> It was very funny, of course ... but at the same time it did touch something inside people ... maybe in a way they would prefer to avoid. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is certainly a very bizarre story. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The year is 1928. </seg>
<seg id="9"> America, which has come from a decade of unprecedented prosperity, is crazy. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The age of Jazz, so it was called. Rhythms are syncopated, costumes are more relaxed. Liqueurs are less expensive when they are found. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It is an era of heroes of various kinds, of discredited acrobatics ... of clandestine bars and gorgeous festivals. </seg>
<seg id="12"> A typical party takes place in the Long Island estate ... </seg>
<seg id="13"> of Sutton ... people in sight and patrons. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Politicians and poets ... are elbow with the cream of high society. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The party is featured by Scott Fitzgerald ... who sets a 20th century portrait on paper ... </seg>
<seg id="16"> for subsequent generations. He writes on his notebook ... something about a curious little man, named Leon Selwin, or Zelman ... who seemed undoubtedly an aristocrat ... and exalted the riches' talents while chatting with the people of the beautiful world. </seg>
<seg id="17"> He spoke of Coolidge and the Republican Party with veneration ... all with a refined accent of Boston. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "An hour later," writes Fitzgerald ... "I was stuck in seeing the same person ..." talking to the kitchen guards. </seg>
<seg id="19"> "This time he claimed to be a Democrat ..." and his accent was cruder, as if he were one of the people "... This is the first time Leonard Zelig has been told. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Florida, a year later. </seg>
<seg id="21"> There is a strange incident ... in the New York Yankees training camp. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Journalists, as always anxious ... to immortalize the great batters' business ... notice a strange new player ... waiting for his turn after Babe Ruth. </seg>
<seg id="23"> He's listed as Lou Zelig ... but none of the team ever heard about him. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Guards are called ... and escorted out of the facility. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The fact appears in a loophole in the newspapers of the next day. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Chicago, Illinois, same year. </seg>
<seg id="27"> There is a private party ... in a clandestine bar on the South Side. </seg>
<seg id="28"> People belonging to respectable classes ... dance and drink distilled gin in the house. </seg>
<seg id="29"> That evening is Calvin Turner, a waiter. </seg>
<seg id="30"> There was a lot of gangsters in the room. </seg>
<seg id="31"> They give us good tips and treat us well. And we treated our customers well. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In that particular evening, it's a weird guy. I never saw her before ... so I ask the other waiters ... </seg>
<seg id="33"> "John, do you know that guy?" Have you ever seen him? "He looks at it and ..." No, never seen before. </seg>
<seg id="34"> "I do not know who he is ..." but what I know is that he has the tough air "... </seg>
<seg id="35"> So I look again and ... the guy was gone. </seg>
<seg id="36"> I do not know where she went ... but at that moment usually the music starts ... and the band starts playing. Have a look and I see a kind of color that plays the trumpet. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Damn, it did not sound bad at all! I look good at the guy ... and I say "it looks like that gangster before ..." but that was white, while this guy is black "... and just did not realize it was happening ...! </seg>
<seg id="38"> New York City. A few months later. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The police are investigating the disappearance of an employee ... named Leonard Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Both her homeowner and her employer ... have reported her disappearance. </seg>
<seg id="41"> They describe it to the Police as a strange little man who was on his own. </seg>
<seg id="42"> There are two clues in the Zelig apartment at Greenwich Village. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The first is a photograph of Zelig with Eugene O'Neill ... the other one where he looks like the protagonist of "Pagliacci". </seg>
<seg id="44"> Based on a blown, they trace him around Chinatown ... where, in the back of a Chinese shop ... an oriental odd look is found ... which corresponds to Leonard Zelig's description. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Surprised, the investigators try to tear off camming ... but it's not a camouflage, and a brawl breaks. </seg>
<seg id="46"> He is taken away by force and led to the Manhattan Hospital. </seg>
<seg id="47"> In the ambulance, she shouts and angers ... in a language that seems to be just Chinese. </seg>
<seg id="48"> It is held firmly with the jacket. </seg>
<seg id="49"> When he comes out of the car, he is no longer a Chinese ... but a white man. </seg>
<seg id="50"> The doctors, disconcerted, send him to the emergency room ... in observation. </seg>
<seg id="51"> By 7, Dr. Eudora Fletcher, a psychiatrist ... is doing his usual lap. </seg>
<seg id="52"> When I heard of this particular case ... I did not think of anything special ... and when I first saw him ... it was a little strange, because I switched it to a doctor. </seg>
<seg id="53"> He had a way to behave very ... professional. </seg>
<seg id="54"> As a young psychiatrist he was ... Eudora Fletcher is fascinated by Leonard Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="55"> It convinces the members of the hospital staff, quite traditional ... to let them study the new patient. </seg>
<seg id="56"> - What profession do you do? - I? I'm a psychiatrist. </seg>
<seg id="57"> - Oh yes? - I work especially with paranoids. </seg>
<seg id="58"> - You talk to me. - Oh, there is not much to say. </seg>
<seg id="59"> I work mostly in Europe ... and I've written several articles of psychoanalysis. </seg>
<seg id="60"> I studied a lot. I worked with Freud in Vienna. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Our disagreement began with the envy of the penis. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Freud maintained that it should be limited to women. </seg>
<seg id="63"> It was not what he said was completely meaningless. </seg>
<seg id="64"> It was a mixture of obscure phrases in jargon by psychologists ... </seg>
<seg id="65"> which he had probably heard somewhere ... or had learned by reading. </seg>
<seg id="66"> The funny thing was that his talk was really smooth ... and he could even be convincing ... for someone not in the trade. </seg>
<seg id="67"> Who was this Leonard Zelig, who seemed to stir everywhere ... so different impressions? </seg>
<seg id="68"> All we know about him is that he was a son ... of a Jewish actor named Morris Zelig ... whose interpretations of Puck ... in the Hebrew-orthodox version of "Midnight Midnight Dream" .. He was coldly received. </seg>
<seg id="69"> The second wedding of Father Zelig ... is characterized by a series of violent quarrels so much that ... although the family is dressed up on a bowling ... it's just from bowling noise that comes to the noise. </seg>
<seg id="70"> As a child, Leonard is often targeted by anti-Semites. </seg>
<seg id="71"> His parents, who never take his defenses ... and if they take it with him for anything, they go for anti-Semites. </seg>
<seg id="72"> They often punish him by locking him in a darkroom. </seg>
<seg id="73"> When they are angry ... they enter the closet with him. </seg>
<seg id="74"> On the deathbed, Morris Zelig tells his son ... that life is a useless nightmare full of suffering ... and the only advice it is given is to keep the laces of the shoes used. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Though his brother Jack has a nervous breakdown ... and his sister Ruth is a thief and an alcoholic ... Leonard Zelig seems to have adapted to life. </seg>
<seg id="76"> Somehow, he can arrange himself. </seg>
<seg id="77"> Then, suddenly, an increasingly strange behavior. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Fascinated by the Zelig phenomenon ... Dr. Fletcher organizes a series of experiments ... and invites skeptical colleagues to observe. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Under the eyes of the doctors, Zelig becomes a perfect psychiatrist. </seg>
<seg id="80"> When two Frenchmen come in ... Zelig takes care of their character and speaks a discreet French. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Alongside a Chinese ... it begins to take on an oriental look. </seg>
<seg id="82"> At this point, the story is leaked to the press ... and the audience, always thrilled with emotions and novelties ... has been attracted to it. </seg>
<seg id="83"> The shock is so ... that Dr. Allan Sindell is forced to make a statement. </seg>
<seg id="84"> Let's just begin to understand the real dimensions ... of what might be the medical discovery of the century ... if not all the time. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Every day, the press publishes new details ... on Zelig and its disconcerting condition. </seg>
<seg id="86"> Although the doctors claim to have the situation under control ... they do not even agree on the same diagnosis. </seg>
<seg id="87"> It depends on the endocrine system. Although there is no evidence of dysfunction ... I am sure that further analysis will confirm the problem. </seg>
<seg id="88"> He took it by eating Mexican food. </seg>
<seg id="89"> They are neurological symptoms. </seg>
<seg id="90"> The patient suffers from a brain tumor ... and I would not be surprised if he died in a few weeks. </seg>
<seg id="91"> We have not been able to locate the tumor yet ... but we are looking for it. </seg>
<seg id="92"> Ironically, it was Dr. Birsky ... to die of brain tumor within two weeks. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Leonard Zelig is fine. </seg>
<seg id="94"> During these weeks of experiments and guesses ... Eudora Fletcher begins to guess ... that the patient might suffer ... not a physiological disorder ... but a psychic. </seg>
<seg id="95"> It is Zelig's unstable physical constitution that suggests ... the explanation for his metamorphosis. </seg>
<seg id="96"> The doctors advice is hostile to his theory. </seg>
<seg id="97"> They conclude that Zelig's disease ... would be attributed to a defect in alignment of the vertebrae. </seg>
<seg id="98"> The tests prove they are wrong ... and cause a temporary problem to the patient. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Now, the press and the public cling to every little news ... totally taken from this human drama. </seg>
<seg id="100"> The saga of the strange creature of the Manhattan Hospital continues. </seg>
<seg id="101"> Experiences have been made today. Women of various kinds were placed close to the subject ... but there was no change. It would be deduced ... that the phenomenon does not occur with women. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Later, doctors will experiment with a dwarf and a chicken. </seg>
<seg id="103"> Leonard Zelig continues to astonish doctors at the Manhattan Hospital ... after numerous tests have failed ... to determine the nature of this amazing phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="104"> At the request of doctors, the patient meets two overweight men. </seg>
<seg id="105"> While men talk about their obesity, Zelig, after an initial reticence ... joins them, reaching the incredible weight of 113 pounds. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Then, in the presence of two blacks ... </seg>
<seg id="107"> Zelig quickly becomes like them. </seg>
<seg id="108"> What will they invoke next time? </seg>
<seg id="109"> Meanwhile, the first reactions of Americans come. </seg>
<seg id="110"> I would like to be Lenny Zelig, the Transformer. </seg>
<seg id="111"> I would be so many different people, and maybe my wishes would come true. </seg>
<seg id="112"> Leonard Zelig is one of the finest lords ... of all the United States of America. </seg>
<seg id="113"> It is a portent. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Tell me why I take the characteristics ... of the person you are with. </seg>
<seg id="115"> It's safe. </seg>
<seg id="116"> What do you mean by "safe"? </seg>
<seg id="117"> It's safe to be like the others. </seg>
<seg id="118"> Do you want to feel safe? </seg>
<seg id="119"> I want to be welcome. </seg>
<seg id="120"> Penetrating in Zelig's mouth ... Dr. Fletcher slowly puts together the pieces ... of that puzzle that is the behavior of Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Passing the time between the hospital ... and the 42nd street library, fill in your account. </seg>
<seg id="122"> The doctors, during a private meeting, listen to Dr. Fletcher ... describing Zelig as a "human chameleon". </seg>
<seg id="123"> Like the reptile, endowed with nature ... of a wonderful defense system ... which makes it capable of changing color ... and confusing with the surrounding environment ... also Zelig protects ... becoming anyone be near. </seg>
<seg id="124"> Doctors listen and their reaction is skepticism. </seg>
<seg id="125"> "Impossible," they say. "Absurd". </seg>
<seg id="126"> "If it's a lizard," jokes one of the doctors ... "we should not spend the hospital's precious money to feed it ..." but it would simply be enough to catch some fly. " </seg>
<seg id="127"> Well, we knew we had a good story, that time ... because it was inside of it all. Feeling ... suspense. </seg>
<seg id="128"> That one, Zelig, was born poor. </seg>
<seg id="129"> My editor-in-chief told me "Ted, this story ..." we want her on the front page every day "... </seg>
<seg id="130"> At that time, he would do his best to sell newspapers. </seg>
<seg id="131"> Usually she was taking a story, she was brave ... she exaggerated, she took some freedom with the facts. </seg>
<seg id="132"> But that was a real, genuine story. </seg>
<seg id="133"> It was enough to say the truth and sell newspapers. It never happened before! </seg>
<seg id="134"> Suddenly, Leonard Zelig became ... the main topic of conversation everywhere ... and he talks about it with amazement and fun. </seg>
<seg id="135"> There is no worldly gathering where there is no joke on Zelig ... and, in a decade characterized by so many dancing in vogue ... a new dragging the nation. </seg>
<seg id="136"> What is white, black and yellow, and has four eyes? </seg>
<seg id="137"> Leonard Zelig at the League of Nations. </seg>
<seg id="138"> Not everyone, anyway ... are enchanted by the human chameleon ... and among the extremist fanatics ... it becomes a convenient symbol of iniquity. </seg>
<seg id="139"> This is personifies the capitalist man. </seg>
<seg id="140"> A creature that takes many forms, to achieve ... its purposes, the exploitation of workers by deceit. </seg>
<seg id="141"> For Ku Klux Klan, Zelig ... a Jew capable of transforming ... into a nigger or a punk, is a threefold threat. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Meanwhile, Dr. Fletcher ... confident of the correctness of his discoveries ... begs to be given more time with the patient ... to put into practice his theories. </seg>
<seg id="143"> Do you remember when you started to behave like someone around you? </seg>
<seg id="144"> At school, my good companions asked me if I'd read Moby Dick. </seg>
<seg id="145"> - And then? - I was ashamed because I did not read it. </seg>
<seg id="146"> - So you pretended? - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="147"> When did the mutations begin to happen automatically? </seg>
<seg id="148"> Years ago. At St. Patrick's Day. </seg>
<seg id="149"> I went into a bar. I was not dressed in green. </seg>
<seg id="150"> They made comments. I become Irish. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Would you tell them to be Irish? </seg>
<seg id="152"> My hair became red, my nose turned me up. </seg>
<seg id="153"> I spoke of famine and gnomes. </seg>
<seg id="154"> We do not agree with Dr. Fletcher's ideas. </seg>
<seg id="155"> We believe that they are all fairy tales. </seg>
<seg id="156"> A change in Zelig's disease ... can only be achieved through some experimental medicines ... which, though risky, make wonders. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Zelig is treated with an experimental drug ... the somdrile hydrate. </seg>
<seg id="158"> It is going through severe mood changes ... and for several days it does not leave the wall. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Then, suddenly ... when Dr. Fletcher begins to get results ... Zelig's fate is taking a new turn ... when his sister Ruth amazes everyone by taking him away from the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="160"> "At home, you will be better cared for," he tells doctors. </seg>
<seg id="161"> Explain that he will be better assisted by her and her lover, Mertin Geist, of a misunderstanding ... a businessman and former Luna Park impresario. </seg>
<seg id="162"> There is little resistance from doctors ... happy to get rid of such a frustrating case. </seg>
<seg id="163"> Only Dr. Fletcher is interested in Zelig as a human being. </seg>
<seg id="164"> He insists he desperately needs special care ... but it's all worthless. </seg>
<seg id="165"> No, no one questioned his legal rights over Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="166"> She was her sister-in-law and she was reliant on her ... but she had a strange boyfriend, named Geist. </seg>
<seg id="167"> He had been in jail for real estate scams. </seg>
<seg id="168"> He sold the same property ... to a lot of different people. </seg>
<seg id="169"> A Delaware MP bought it twice. </seg>
<seg id="170"> The crowd lurking along the streets to see the escape ... the human chameleon blocks traffic for days. </seg>
<seg id="171"> It is an attraction for tourists and children. </seg>
<seg id="172"> People coming from all over the country get stuck for some space ... to take a look at this new wonder. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Souvenir sale ... while the brother is exhibited ... it's just the beginning, for Ruth Zelig and Martin Geist. </seg>
<seg id="174"> They pay the entrance for the two daily demonstrations ... of Leonard's extraordinary skill. </seg>
<seg id="175"> He does not disappoint anyone ... and he changes continuously, on request. </seg>
<seg id="176"> Suddenly, it has become an attraction, a novelty ... a barbarian phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="177"> In this 1935 film based on Zelig's life ... and titled "The Man Who Changes" ... this atmosphere is well described. </seg>
<seg id="178"> I can not give up. I know that if I have the chance I can cure it. </seg>
<seg id="179"> It's useless. The lawyer also says there is no hope. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Seriously, Dr. Fletcher ... can I call you Eudora? </seg>
<seg id="181"> Believe me, behind that vacuous face, that zombie look ... </seg>
<seg id="182"> there is a real human being, and I can make it come out. </seg>
<seg id="183"> - As? - I'll find the way. </seg>
<seg id="184"> A new technique. Whatever it is, it must be very personal. </seg>
<seg id="185"> I can not do it very legally. I'll try ... </seg>
<seg id="186"> They do not care about him. They exploit it. </seg>
<seg id="187"> In him they only see a chance to make money. Look. </seg>
<seg id="188"> They are already selling Leonard Zelig's doll. </seg>
<seg id="189"> The film did not exaggerate. There were not only pens and lucky lucky Leonard Zelig ... but also watches, toys, books ... and a famous Zelig puppet. </seg>
<seg id="190"> There were aprons, chamois-like earmuffs ... and a very popular Zelig game. </seg>
<seg id="191"> There were many famous songs ... inspired by Leonard Zelig, motives that dragged the whole nation. </seg>
<seg id="192"> In addition to products and sponsorships ... there are performances that do not end there. </seg>
<seg id="193"> Hollywood is very courteous ... and they offer him a contract for a movie. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Clara Bow invites him for a weekend with her ... and asks him to bring all his personalities. </seg>
<seg id="195"> Chicago meets the heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey ... who jokes with Zelig in the retreat he trains. </seg>
<seg id="196"> In Washington DC, they present him to Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover. </seg>
<seg id="197"> In France they call it "Le lézard" ... and become the main attraction of the Parisian music halls. </seg>
<seg id="198"> His business makes him dear to the main French intellectuals ... who see in him a symbol of everything. </seg>
<seg id="199"> His transformation into rabbi ... is so realistic that some French ... propose to be sent into exile on the Island of the Devil ... </seg>
<seg id="200"> At "Le Folies Bergère" ... Josephine Baker makes his version of the Chameleon Ball ... and later tells his friends ... that he found Zelig upbeat but somewhat lost. </seg>
<seg id="201"> Everyone came to my room ... I mean, all they counted ... and sometimes somebody carried us Zelig ... that is, Leonard ... </seg>
<seg id="202"> Cole Porter was fascinated by Leonard ... and once wrote a verse of a song ... </seg>
<seg id="203"> "You're the tops, you're Leonard Zelig" ... but he could not find anything he could do with Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="204"> "Flying up ..." because I feel I'm falling in love ... "falling in love with you and no one else. </seg>
<seg id="205"> "You've caught my gaze ..." and now I feel I'm falling in love. </seg>
<seg id="206"> "Show me that ring and I'll jump in. </seg>
<seg id="207"> "I was traveling alone." I had a chance to meet you ... "and now I feel a shiver for you. </seg>
<seg id="208"> "Hey, Mr. Zelig, he's ready ..." because I feel I'm falling in love ... "falling in love with you and no one else." </seg>
<seg id="209"> Although performances and parties ... come to Zelig's sister and her lover of wealth and fun ... Zelig's existence is actually a non-existence. </seg>
<seg id="210"> Without his personality ... his human qualities long lost in the drag of his life ... he sits alone, quietly staring at the void. It's a figure, a nullity, a joke of nature. </seg>
<seg id="211"> He just wanted to be part of something ... to walk between his enemies without being noticed, being loved ... he is neither involved nor part of anything ... he is strictly observed by his enemies and is not loved . </seg>
<seg id="212"> Everyone, in the hospital staff, forgot Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="213"> Only Dr. Fletcher continues to struggle to gain protection. </seg>
<seg id="214"> The court rejects its last appeal. </seg>
<seg id="215"> During his brave legal battle ... he is frequently in the company of his lawyer, Charles Koslow. </seg>
<seg id="216"> She falls in love with her ... and she asks her to marry her. </seg>
<seg id="217"> She is ambiguous. </seg>
<seg id="218"> With reluctance, he starts abandoning ... any hope of recovering Leonard Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="219"> That summer, Geist organized an exhibition in Spain. </seg>
<seg id="220"> It is the last stop of a European tour ... which has had a remarkable success. </seg>
<seg id="221"> The relations between Martin Geist and Ruth Zelig ... have been made. </seg>
<seg id="222"> They got tired of each other ... and they quarrel often. </seg>
<seg id="223"> The situation gets worse when you know Luis Martinez ... a mediocre and evil bullfight ... of whom he falls in love. </seg>
<seg id="224"> Though he wanted to impress Ruth Zelig ... </seg>
<seg id="225"> Martinez shows in the arena of his usual panic. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Luck is, however, on his side, this time ... because the bull gets a cerebral emotion. </seg>
<seg id="227"> Martinez takes credit for the killing ... and, cut the ear of the bull ... he offers it to his lover with a bribe. </seg>
<seg id="228"> That night, in jealousy access ... Martin Geist returns to his hotel room ... and faces Ruth Zelig. She asks you to give him his ear. </seg>
<seg id="229"> She refuses. Geist insists he has the ear. </seg>
<seg id="230"> They argue furiously, and you find out Martinez ... hiding in the closet. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Geist pulls out a gun and shoots him. </seg>
<seg id="232"> Then he turns his weapon to Zelig's sister-in-law and kills her. At that point, suicide. In an orgy of jealousy and violence ... Leonard Zelig's life is overturned. </seg>
<seg id="233"> At first, news comes to the fore in the world. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Then, with the same speed ... the audience, always thirsty of emotions, becomes indifferent. </seg>
<seg id="235"> New scandals get news headlines. </seg>
<seg id="236"> Everything moves so fast in the Jazz Age ... fast as Red Grange. </seg>
<seg id="237"> A saturated audience of distractions forgets quickly. </seg>
<seg id="238"> The 1920s culminated in a very serious crisis ... and Leonard Zelig is unavailable. </seg>
<seg id="239"> Dr. Eudora Fletcher seeks to find it unnecessarily. After many runs have turned out to be disappointing ... renunciation, discouraged. </seg>
<seg id="240"> I felt like a pity. It was a unique case ... with which I could build a solid reputation. </seg>
<seg id="241"> Not that I knew how to cure it ... but being able to have it alone ... finding the right path and being innovative and creative ... </seg>
<seg id="242"> I felt that I could change her life ... if only I had the chance. </seg>
<seg id="243"> Shoulder strap with 12 men ... </seg>
<seg id="244"> the gestational chair carrying the Holy Father reaches the central balcony ... from which the Pope will bless Rome and the whole world. </seg>
<seg id="245"> It has been for 63 years that this ceremony was not taking place ... that on this Sunday of Easter will end the rites of Holy Week. </seg>
<seg id="246"> What's happening? A hustle and bustle near the Holy Father. </seg>
<seg id="247"> There is an intruder. </seg>
<seg id="248"> Guards are called, while his sanctity Pius XI tries to hit the intruder with a pontifical decree. </seg>
<seg id="249"> The faithful do not believe in their eyes. </seg>
<seg id="250"> This is of course Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="251"> He is sent back to the United States ... from the Italian authorities ... and is again hospitalized at the Manhattan Hospital. </seg>
<seg id="252"> I am grateful for the opportunity to have Leonard Zelig in charge ... now that he is again under the hospital's responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="253"> I am glad that I have been granted this opportunity. </seg>
<seg id="254"> I sincerely hope to return to society a good citizen, master of self ... and no longer a circus phenomenon without identity. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Dr. Fletcher no longer has time to think about marriage. Now all her attention must be to Leonard Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="256"> His intention is to move him to his country house. </seg>
<seg id="257"> It will create a neutral environment, far from society. </seg>
<seg id="258"> He will seek new therapies to heal him ... in the hope of understanding his singular illness. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Aware of the importance of his work ... </seg>
<seg id="260"> Eudora Fletcher has a movie recording ... of the healing cycle. </seg>
<seg id="261"> In this regard, contact his cousin Paul Deghuee ... inventor and photographer in a timely manner. </seg>
<seg id="262"> He told me "I want to document this case ..." for future generations and for the scientific community. </seg>
<seg id="263"> "I want you to make the camera extremely silent." </seg>
<seg id="264"> I said, "Why do not you just take written notes?" </seg>
<seg id="265"> and she said, "Paul, when a man ..." changes his physical appearance, one must see it in action. </seg>
<seg id="266"> "You can not just read it." And besides, I'm going to go to history. " </seg>
<seg id="267"> The White Room is prepared with care ... to ensure maximum tranquility. </seg>
<seg id="268"> It's a small study at Dr. Fletcher's home ... furnished with a few furniture. </seg>
<seg id="269"> They are briefly nailed to the reflector walls for photography ... to have enough lighting. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Microphones are hidden at strategic points. </seg>
<seg id="271"> The camera is placed behind a glass panel ... which makes it fairly discreet. </seg>
<seg id="272"> The problem is motor noise. They dampen it with a blanket and with what they find underneath. </seg>
<seg id="273"> From this privileged but uncomfortable position ... photographer Paul Deghuee will feature ... the famous White Room Seats ... an outstanding document in the history of psychotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="274"> For current standards ... the White Room sessions appear very primitive ... and yet they were really effective ... in developing a very strong personal relationship ... between doctor and patient. </seg>
<seg id="275"> If Zelig was psychotic ... or just extremely neurotic ... it was a problem that we doctors ... we discussed constantly. </seg>
<seg id="276"> Personally, it seemed to me that his moods ... were not so different from the norm ... maybe those of a normal person ... well balanced and inserted ... only, brought to an extreme degree ... carried excess. </seg>
<seg id="277"> It seemed to me that we could ... in the end consider the conformist as antonoma. </seg>
<seg id="278"> Leonard, do you know why you're here? </seg>
<seg id="279"> To talk about psychiatry, right? </seg>
<seg id="280"> You are a doctor? </seg>
<seg id="281"> Yes. Have you read my article on manic paranoia? </seg>
<seg id="282"> In the end I found out that it's all a matter of head. </seg>
<seg id="283"> And if I told you not to be a doctor? </seg>
<seg id="284"> I'd say you're joking. </seg>
<seg id="285"> Is there always so much light here? </seg>
<seg id="286"> Oh, I'm filming these sessions. Hope you do not mind. </seg>
<seg id="287"> - No. Is anybody out there behind? - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="288"> A camera? </seg>
<seg id="289"> Leonard, why do not we go from the simple facts? </seg>
<seg id="290"> - Leonard, you're not a doctor - no? </seg>
<seg id="291"> No. You're a patient. I'm the doctor. </seg>
<seg id="292"> I would not say too many people if I was in you. </seg>
<seg id="293"> Leonard, you're not a doctor. </seg>
<seg id="294"> Can I leave it here alone? I... </seg>
<seg id="295"> I have to go back to town. Really. I have an interesting case. I follow two pairs of twin siamese twins with personality splitting. And I'm paid by eight people. </seg>
<seg id="296"> "The first week of sessions did not go very well ..." Dr. Fletcher writes in his diary. </seg>
<seg id="297"> "Leonard identifies with me ..." and is convinced he is the doctor. </seg>
<seg id="298"> "It is circumspect and suspicious. </seg>
<seg id="299"> "But it also has something very attractive." He has a mind awake and full of energy. </seg>
<seg id="300"> "Perhaps it is his helplessness that moves me. </seg>
<seg id="301"> "I have to stay flexible and go ahead with the intuition." </seg>
<seg id="302"> How are you doing today, Leonard? </seg>
<seg id="303"> Good. But I have to go back to town. </seg>
<seg id="304"> I have a masturbation course at the psychiatric institute and ... </seg>
<seg id="305"> - I understand - I'm a doctor. And ... "Masturbation dictated by guilt ..." No, no sense of guilt. I teach to an advanced level. </seg>
<seg id="306"> "I'm a very respected physician, Leonard, I wish ... that your eyes follow the pen and that you breathe deeply. </seg>
<seg id="307"> - Because? Thing? - Take it easy... </seg>
<seg id="308"> No. You're trying to hypnotize me ... </seg>
<seg id="309"> - You dry? - Of course I'm dry. I am a doctor. </seg>
<seg id="310"> - It's not true. - Yes, it is true. </seg>
<seg id="311"> - Relax - No, I can not. I have to go back to town. </seg>
<seg id="312"> I have the masturbation course. </seg>
<seg id="313"> If they do not start without me. </seg>
<seg id="314"> As the weeks pass ... Dr. Fletcher is increasingly frustrated. </seg>
<seg id="315"> "Leonard continues to insist on being a doctor ..." and even refuses to let go of hypnotism, "he writes. </seg>
<seg id="316"> "I think his last year's experience ..." have put him defensive as never before. </seg>
<seg id="317"> "It's daunting." It was in a state of great pressure ... it was just a bad thing, nervous. He was fine, he was sleeping, reading sitting in his armchair. He referred to himself as "Dr. Zelig". He read psychiatric books. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I told her to go away for a few days and relax a little. He was pulling the rope too far. </seg>
<seg id="319"> Leaving Zelig alone ... Dr. Fletcher accepts Paul Deghuee's advice ... and takes some hours of relaxation with her boyfriend. </seg>
<seg id="320"> They go to Broadway, then to a famous night club where ... despite the spectacle being lively ... Dr. Fletcher is distracted and uncomfortable. </seg>
<seg id="321"> He can not think of anything other than his patient. </seg>
<seg id="322"> The atmosphere between her and her boyfriend Koslow is embarrassing. </seg>
<seg id="323"> He is baffled by his obsession with Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Ironically, it's just in the smoky and noisy environment ... of the Night Club that Eudora Fletcher ... is blown away by a brilliant and innovative idea ... which will lead to a clumsy turn in the case. </seg>
<seg id="325"> - Dr. Zelig? - Yup? </seg>
<seg id="326"> Could you help me solve a problem? </seg>
<seg id="327"> I can definitely try it. I can not promise anything, obviously. </seg>
<seg id="328"> The other day I was in the presence of pretty educated people ... who discussed the novel Moby Dick ... and I was afraid to admit I had not read it, so I lied. </seg>
<seg id="329"> I wanted so much to be accepted, to be like the others, to be different. </seg>
<seg id="330"> - It's natural. - I really do everything to integrate. </seg>
<seg id="331"> But she is a doctor, she should know how to handle it. </seg>
<seg id="332"> But the fact is, in fact ... I'm not a real doctor. </seg>
<seg id="333"> - It is not? - No, doctor. </seg>
<seg id="334"> No, I'm pretending to be up to my friends. </seg>
<seg id="335"> You know, I'm a doctor. </seg>
<seg id="336"> What a story! just </seg>
<seg id="337"> But she is a doctor and can help me. It must help me. </seg>
<seg id="338"> To tell the truth ... I do not feel very good. </seg>
<seg id="339"> All my life was a lie. </seg>
<seg id="340"> I pretended to be one after the other. </seg>
<seg id="341"> She needs help, ma'am. </seg>
<seg id="342"> The other night I dreamed I fell in the fire. What does it mean? </seg>
<seg id="343"> It's terrible. I do not know. I... </seg>
<seg id="344"> Please, doctor. I know I'm a tough patient. </seg>
<seg id="345"> - Jesus. I do not feel very good. - What's my problem? </seg>
<seg id="346"> What do I know? I'm not a doctor. </seg>
<seg id="347"> - It is not? - No. Is that it? </seg>
<seg id="348"> - Who are you? - What does it mean, who am I? </seg>
<seg id="349"> - They are difficult questions. - Leonard Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="350"> - Definitely. Who is? - She. </seg>
<seg id="351"> No. I'm nobody. I'm nothing. </seg>
<seg id="352"> Take me ... I'm falling! </seg>
<seg id="353"> Playing with his identity disorder ... </seg>
<seg id="354"> Dr. Fletcher has skillfully pushed Zelig into a moment of disorientation. </seg>
<seg id="355"> As his defenses are lowered, he hypnotizes him immediately. </seg>
<seg id="356"> Using the post-hypnotic suggestion ... he will now be able to induce him in trance to his pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="357"> My brother beat me. </seg>
<seg id="358"> My sister beat my brother. </seg>
<seg id="359"> My father beat my sister and my brother and me. </seg>
<seg id="360"> My mother beat my father and sister and me and my brother. </seg>
<seg id="361"> The neighbors were killing the whole family. </seg>
<seg id="362"> Those of the other isolated beat our neighbors and our family. </seg>
<seg id="363"> I'm 12 years old. </seg>
<seg id="364"> I'm in a synagogue. </seg>
<seg id="365"> I ask the Rabbi the meaning of life. </seg>
<seg id="366"> He tells me the meaning of life ... but he explains it in Hebrew. </seg>
<seg id="367"> I do not understand Hebrew. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Then he wants $ 600 to give me Jewish lessons. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Dr. Fletcher's therapy consists of a two-way attack. </seg>
<seg id="370"> During the trance state, the personality will be ... deeply analyzed and restructured. In the conscious state ... she will give you love, affection ... and an unconditional respect. </seg>
<seg id="371"> You will be completely sincere. </seg>
<seg id="372"> You're in a deep trance. </seg>
<seg id="373"> You will not become what you believe I want you to be, but only yourself. </seg>
<seg id="374"> Tell me, what do you think about this accommodation? </seg>
<seg id="375"> It sucks. </seg>
<seg id="376"> I hate the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="377"> I hate grass and mosquitoes. </seg>
<seg id="378"> And the kitchen ... Your kitchen is terrible. </seg>
<seg id="379"> Your crêpe ... </seg>
<seg id="380"> I'm ... I throw it in the garbage every time you turn. </seg>
<seg id="381"> And those jokes you're trying to tell ... when you think you're funny ... they're long and meaningless, they never end. </seg>
<seg id="382"> I see. What else? </seg>
<seg id="383"> I want to come to bed with you. </seg>
<seg id="384"> It surprises me. I did not think I liked you a lot. </seg>
<seg id="385"> I love you. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Seriously? </seg>
<seg id="387"> You're so sweet, because ... you're not smart as you think you are. </seg>
<seg id="388"> You're confused ... and nervous, and you're a bad cook. </seg>
<seg id="389"> Those crêpe ... </seg>
<seg id="390"> Oh, I love you. </seg>
<seg id="391"> I want to take care of you. </seg>
<seg id="392"> Basta crêpe ... </seg>
<seg id="393"> I had started ... trying to use Leonard to make me a reputation. Then I found that I had strong feelings for him. </seg>
<seg id="394"> I never thought I was attractive. </seg>
<seg id="395"> I had never been in love really. </seg>
<seg id="396"> Charles Koslow was the kind of man ... my mother thought I should marry. </seg>
<seg id="397"> Feeling more confident with the patient ... Dr. Fletcher brings him out, with caution ... to spend an afternoon at his sister's house in the nearby Teaneck. </seg>
<seg id="398"> Meryl Fletcher is an avid ... an excellent professional pilot. </seg>
<seg id="399"> Eudora Fletcher is an amateur pilot ... and the afternoon runs fast while relaxing ... and they talk about old flight experiences. </seg>
<seg id="400"> As the weeks pass ... Zelig is encouraged to open more and more ... and to express his personal opinions. </seg>
<seg id="401"> Since it was early, it soon became expansive. </seg>
<seg id="402"> I hated my stepmother, and I'm afraid if you come to know. </seg>
<seg id="403"> I love baseball. </seg>
<seg id="404"> No matter what it means, it's just nice to see. </seg>
<seg id="405"> I am a Democrat. I've always been. </seg>
<seg id="406"> Are you sorry if I do not share your taste on that disc? </seg>
<seg id="407"> - Of course not. - You know, Brahms is always ... too melodramatic for me. </seg>
<seg id="408"> You have to be yourself and make your choices ... even when they require courage, or you're like a robot, or a lizard. </seg>
<seg id="409"> Will you really put that lawyer up? </seg>
<seg id="410"> I would prefer not to. </seg>
<seg id="411"> No, I do not agree. I think that Mussolini is a loser. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Will we ever make love? </seg>
<seg id="413"> Three months have passed ... and the hospital staff wants to examine the patient. </seg>
<seg id="414"> Dr. Fletcher says Zelig is not yet ready to leave. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Doctors decide to visit it on the spot. </seg>
<seg id="416"> The date is set: 4 days later. </seg>
<seg id="417"> If the progress becomes unsatisfactory ... they will take it away from its care. </seg>
<seg id="418"> I was very nervous because she was awake ... she did not remember anything about her trance state ... and I was wondering if there was a way ... to link the two events. </seg>
<seg id="419"> I was also afraid that ... putting him in front of strong personalities ... he could lose his. </seg>
<seg id="420"> The doctors arrive Sunday at noon. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Eudora Fletcher and Leonard Zelig ... welcome them and let them see their property. </seg>
<seg id="422"> Dr. Fletcher is tense and alarmed. </seg>
<seg id="423"> Leonard Zelig, however, seems calm and comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="424"> Despite being surrounded by doctors ... it does not turn into one of them. </seg>
<seg id="425"> The meeting seems to be a thrilling success ... until Dr. Henry Mayerson makes an innocent comment ... on time, saying it's a good day. </seg>
<seg id="426"> Zelig answers Dr Mayerson for not agreeing ... and that's not a good day. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Dr. Mayerson is surprised ... by the power of Zelig's conviction. </seg>
<seg id="428"> It points out that the sun shines and that the temperature is mild. </seg>
<seg id="429"> Zelig, accustomed to giving voice to his opinions without hesitation ... is too aggressive. It is too much conditioned in the opposite direction ... it has become stubborn about its views ... and it does not tolerate any divergence from its way of seeing. </seg>
<seg id="430"> I had pushed her too far in the opposite. </seg>
<seg id="431"> He struck Dr. Mayerson and other staff members ... with a rake. </seg>
<seg id="432"> It's not what we wanted ... yet I felt I got something. </seg>
<seg id="433"> If I had had it for another two weeks ... I would have perfected my techniques ... and let Leonard Zelig return himself. </seg>
<seg id="434"> Dr. Eudora Nesbit Fletcher, hero, indeed heroin, of the moment. </seg>
<seg id="435"> The beautiful, intelligent psychiatrist never doubted the fact ... that Leonard Zelig, the human chameleon, was suffering from mental illness. </seg>
<seg id="436"> Working with his cousin, filmmaker Paul Deghuee ... has recorded very important documentation ... which includes precious Zelig filming under hypnosis. </seg>
<seg id="437"> In the course of the care, the doctor and the patient have become friends ... and spend time together even outside the therapy. </seg>
<seg id="438"> The courage to uphold a minority opinion has led ... to a pompous success for psychiatry. </seg>
<seg id="439"> Who says that women are only brave to sew? </seg>
<seg id="440"> Let's go to the town hall where the heroes of the moment will receive the keys of the city. </seg>
<seg id="441"> We are honored to deliver you the keys to the city of New York. </seg>
<seg id="442"> Jimmy Walker wanted to be here with us ... and sing "Leonard the lizard" but was a bit too busy. </seg>
<seg id="443"> Then, Eudora Fletcher, the beautiful and ingenious doctor ... who healed Zelig from his enigmatic illness ... receives the honor of his fellow scientists at the Waldorf Astoria in New York. </seg>
<seg id="444"> There are luminaries all over the world, not just psychiatrists ... but also physicists, biologists, mathematicians and so on. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Here we see it discussing with Nils Andersen ... pioneer in the field of blood diseases. </seg>
<seg id="446"> He will then receive another recognition from the world's largest city ... when he will baptize his first ship. </seg>
<seg id="447"> A remarkable success for a country girl. </seg>
<seg id="448"> I'm talking to you from Mrs Catherine Fletcher's home ... Mother of Dr. Eudora Fletcher ... the famous psychiatrist who is on all newspapers. </seg>
<seg id="449"> I would like to ask Mrs. Fletcher ... first of all, to tell us what effect does a genius of medicine grow. And then I would like to talk about all the sacrifices made ... to fund his studies. </seg>
<seg id="450"> Please speak in the microphone, thank you. </seg>
<seg id="451"> We have not made any sacrifices. John was a stockbroker ... he had a lot of money, and I came from a wealthy Philadelphia family. </seg>
<seg id="452"> I'm sure his daughter has always wanted to be a doctor ... since she was a kid. </seg>
<seg id="453"> I would not say that. </seg>
<seg id="454"> I always thought she wanted to fly like her sister, and get a family ... - but she was a very grumpy little girl. - But surely every mother dreams ... that her little girl has the success of her daughter. </seg>
<seg id="455"> - It was a very difficult girl - Tell me about her husband ... </seg>
<seg id="456"> It turns out to be just a businessman. </seg>
<seg id="457"> Must be really excited ... </seg>
<seg id="458"> to see her daughter get similar awards ... </seg>
<seg id="459"> John had problems. Depression. And he drank. </seg>
<seg id="460"> Well, Mrs Fletcher, thank you very much for being with us today. </seg>
<seg id="461"> Here at San Simeon ... the fairy tales of print magnate William Randolph Hearst ... various famous people are tantalizing or tanning. </seg>
<seg id="462"> Here is Marie Dressler with Mr. Hearst. Always a very popular guest ... </seg>
<seg id="463"> Miss Dressler accepts a flower from an ardent admirer. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Along with her is Marion Davies. </seg>
<seg id="465"> When it comes to work, Miss Davies is always very serious ... but here, in this wonderful playground ... it demonstrates its spiritual side. </seg>
<seg id="466"> Here it is, with ... no less than Charlie Chaplin, always kidding. </seg>
<seg id="467"> Although New York is almost 5000 km away ... </seg>
<seg id="468"> Jimmy Walker looks like magic at Mr. Hearst's enchanted gate. </seg>
<seg id="469"> Another New Yorker is Leonard Zelig ... who is kidding with our favorite cowboy, Tom Mix. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Will not Tony be jealous of you? </seg>
<seg id="471"> Tony is Tom's horse, and we thought they were always together. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Here's the good Chaplin again this time with Adolphe Menjou. </seg>
<seg id="473"> Here's Claire Windsor and Dolores del Rio ... and a fascinating Eudora Fletcher ... who chats with Hollywood's latest star, James Cagney. </seg>
<seg id="474"> Oh, and who are we here? </seg>
<seg id="475"> A beautiful lady named Carole Lombard. </seg>
<seg id="476"> And down there we see Dr. Fletcher and Leonard Zelig ... who take a couple of strokes with Bobby Jones on Mr. Hearst's field. </seg>
<seg id="477"> Unless Leonard does not recover his chameleon personality ... and turns into a professional ... I'll bet my money on Bobby. </seg>
<seg id="478"> But what does it matter if they have fun? </seg>
<seg id="479"> Leonard, do you want to give some advice to the young people in this country? </seg>
<seg id="480"> Certainly. Guys, you have to be yourself. You can not imitate others ... just because you believe they have all the answers you are looking for. </seg>
<seg id="481"> You have to be yourself and learn to speak your voice aloud. </seg>
<seg id="482"> Perhaps in other countries can not be done, but this is America. </seg>
<seg id="483"> Believe me, because first I belonged to the reptile family ... but now no more. </seg>
<seg id="484"> Zelig, no longer a chameleon, is again himself. </seg>
<seg id="485"> His point of view on politics, art and love ... is sincere and sincere. </seg>
<seg id="486"> Although his tastes are described by many as mediocre ... they are his. </seg>
<seg id="487"> He is finally an individual, a human being. </seg>
<seg id="488"> He no longer abandons his identity ... to try to be a safe and invisible part of his environment. </seg>
<seg id="489"> His tastes were not so terrible. </seg>
<seg id="490"> It was the kind of person who preferred to watch baseball ... rather than reading "Moby Dick" ... and that was what made him a bad road ... at least, so does the legend. </seg>
<seg id="491"> It was more than a question of symbolism. For the Marxists, it represented a certain thing. </seg>
<seg id="492"> The Catholic Church never pardoned ... the Vatican accident. </seg>
<seg id="493"> The Americans ... with the Great Depression ... saw in him the symbol of the possibility ... of improvement, self-realization. </seg>
<seg id="494"> And of course, the Freudians looked at us ... they could interpret it as they wanted. </seg>
<seg id="495"> It was all symbolic, but there were not ... two intellectuals who agreed on the meaning. </seg>
<seg id="496"> I do not know if it can be called a triumph of psychotherapy. It is more than a triumph of aesthetic instincts. Dr. Fletcher's techniques had nothing ... at the therapy schools of then. </seg>
<seg id="497"> She knew what she needed and provided it. This was, in his own way, an extraordinary achievement. </seg>
<seg id="498"> If I think about it, it seems to me that his story ... reflects to a large extent the Jewish experience in America ... the great need to get wide, find his place ... and assimilate into culture. </seg>
<seg id="499"> He had a craving to assimilate. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Even Eudora Fletcher's life has changed ... from this experience. </seg>
<seg id="501"> For her, fame and recognition are reckless rewards ... and do not match the youth fantasies ... that have awakened her ambition. </seg>
<seg id="502"> She and her patient fell in love ... and it is no surprise to anyone that she leaves ... the ambitious lawyer Koslow ... and announces her wedding plans with Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="503"> It was great to see my sister and Leonard together. </seg>
<seg id="504"> He gave them strength ... and they were so in love ... and she seemed happier than she had been in so many years. </seg>
<seg id="505"> I remember that they decided to get married in the spring ... and then, of course ... it all ended up rolling. </seg>
<seg id="506"> Two weeks before the wedding ... an ex-souvenir named Lita Fox goes ahead ... and says she is married to Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="507"> He also says he had a son with him. </seg>
<seg id="508"> The scandal is immediate. </seg>
<seg id="509"> We got married a year ago. He told me he was an actor. </seg>
<seg id="510"> It seemed credible, and I'm also in the world of entertainment. </seg>
<seg id="511"> So we went to Baltimore and married ... and here I have the license that proves it. </seg>
<seg id="512"> He had married her under another personality. </seg>
<seg id="513"> When she read about her upcoming marriage with Eudora Fletcher ... she had been mortified and had decided to sue. </seg>
<seg id="514"> Zelig announces that he will fight in court ... but public opinion begins to turn his face. </seg>
<seg id="515"> Attractive lawyers paint Lita Fox as an abandoned woman. </seg>
<seg id="516"> The child is neglected, poor and without father. </seg>
<seg id="517"> Zelig has sold Hollywood's story to Hollywood ... for a large sum of money. </seg>
<seg id="518"> When the scandal bursts ... the studios ask for money back. </seg>
<seg id="519"> Zelig can only return half of it. The rest was spent. </seg>
<seg id="520"> Scandalized, the studios only give him half of his life. They keep the best moments ... and only the hours of sleep and meals remain. </seg>
<seg id="521"> Zelig is shaken by scandal, but this is just the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="522"> Now another woman comes forward: Helen Gray, a commissar at a Winsconsin souvenir shop ... says Zelig is the father of his two twins. </seg>
<seg id="523"> She says to lawyers who had come up as a furry hunter. </seg>
<seg id="524"> Zelig does not remember, but admits ... that may have happened during one of his metamorphoses. </seg>
<seg id="525"> It is the drop that overflows the vessel. </seg>
<seg id="526"> He married me in the Harlem church. </seg>
<seg id="527"> He told me to be Duke Ellington's brother. </seg>
<seg id="528"> It's the guy who has driven me off the car. It was brand new. </seg>
<seg id="529"> Then he put the back and passed on my mother's wrist. </seg>
<seg id="530"> It's old and uses a lot of wrist. </seg>
<seg id="531"> He painted the house of an obscene color. He said he was a painter. When I saw the result I did not believe in my eyes. Then he disappeared. </seg>
<seg id="532"> What Zelig is responsible for ... the behaviors of each of the personalities he has taken ... means for him only one thing: dozens of complaints. </seg>
<seg id="533"> He is sued for bigotry, adultery ... car accidents, plagiarism, domestic accidents ... negligence, property damage, property damage ... and for performing unnecessary extraction of teeth. </seg>
<seg id="534"> I would like to apologize to everyone. </seg>
<seg id="535"> I'm terribly sorry to have married all those women. </seg>
<seg id="536"> It's just ... I do not know, I thought it was the right thing. </seg>
<seg id="537"> And to the lord to whom I removed the appendage ... no ... I do not know what to say. </seg>
<seg id="538"> If it can comfort her, I still have her home somewhere. </seg>
<seg id="539"> My deeper apologies go to the Trokman family in Detroit. </seg>
<seg id="540"> I never gave birth to a baby ... and I thought the ice pincers were the right tool. </seg>
<seg id="541"> By leveraging on mercy and legal technical skills ... American attorneys have their time of glory. </seg>
<seg id="542"> Zelig is branded as a criminal. Despite Dr. Fletcher's insistence that Zelig can not ... be held responsible for his actions in his chameleon state ... it's all worthless. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Leonard Zelig is a bad example for the nation's morale. America is a morally right country. God's Timorate. </seg>
<seg id="544"> We do not forgive scandals ... scandals of fraud and polygamy. </seg>
<seg id="545"> In the name of the principles of a pure society ... I say, we lick that miserable Jew! </seg>
<seg id="546"> During this humiliating trial ... Eudora Fletcher stands bravely beside the man she loves. </seg>
<seg id="547"> In private, trusts friends ... to be worried about Zelig's emotional conditions ... that seem to deteriorate ... under the weight of common morals. </seg>
<seg id="548"> In public, Zelig tries to prove master of himself ... but it is getting harder. </seg>
<seg id="549"> It is clear that he is going to pieces ... when he and Eudora dine in a Greek restaurant and ... mid-dinner, Zelig begins to turn into a Greek. </seg>
<seg id="550"> Desperately desires to be again welcome ... accepted, inserted. </seg>
<seg id="551"> The clamor of the public on her morality reaches paroxysm ... and on the eve of the sentence ... Leonard Zelig disappears. </seg>
<seg id="552"> Chief Inspector Thomas Dowd speaks ... in a nationwide press release. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Leonard Zelig has disappeared. On the eve of his sentence ... for a set of crimes and misdeeds ... ranging from polygamy to fraud, he was stained. </seg>
<seg id="554"> We are looking for clues and we would appreciate the contribution of anyone ... have information that can lead to his capture. </seg>
<seg id="555"> My sister was literally torn apart. </seg>
<seg id="556"> He was trying to keep calm ... but he was just ... shocked. </seg>
<seg id="557"> And it was not even the kind of person ... who usually shows his feelings ... except for what Leonard meant. </seg>
<seg id="558"> Dr Fletcher and the police are in daily contact. By common accord, they make public calls ... to anyone who can provide some news. </seg>
<seg id="559"> Apart from some absurd calls ... they do not get anything. </seg>
<seg id="560"> The months pass and Zelig has no trace. </seg>
<seg id="561"> Cars are searched. False clues raining from everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="562"> His jacket is found in Texas ... where a hunting man turns out to be useless. </seg>
<seg id="563"> They say they saw him in Chicago, California. </seg>
<seg id="564"> In this photo of a Marian music group in Mexico ... there is a man who seems to resemble him. </seg>
<seg id="565"> Dr. Fletcher continues to look for Zelig ... but hope fades away every day more. </seg>
<seg id="566"> I could only think about Leonard ... to what I missed and how much I loved her ... and to all the wonderful moments she had spent together. </seg>
<seg id="567"> These days were really painful for me. </seg>
<seg id="568"> The year ends and Zelig is still unavailable. </seg>
<seg id="569"> I was just dragging me here and there and crying. </seg>
<seg id="570"> And one evening after a particularly bad time ... my sister Meryl told me ... "Come on, we go out for dinner or a concert" ... I said, "No, I can not do it" but she insisted. </seg>
<seg id="571"> We got out and finally we went to see a movie. </seg>
<seg id="572"> We saw "Grand Hotel" and there was also a news event. </seg>
<seg id="573"> Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist Party ... gain ground in a Berlin hit by depression. </seg>
<seg id="574"> Denouncing the Treaty of Versailles ... the Nazis leverage German patriotism. </seg>
<seg id="575"> Eudora Fletcher remains silent. </seg>
<seg id="576"> In the midst of the Nazis ... he sees a person who might be Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="577"> In fact, the thing was meaningful ... because although he wanted to be loved ... he wanted to be loved ... there was something in him ... that he wanted to disappear in the mass, in the general anonymity. And fascism offers Zelig this kind of possibilities ... so that he can make himself anonymous ... belonging to this vast mass movement. </seg>
<seg id="578"> The doctor embarks for Europe the following week ... and ten days after arriving in Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="579"> Germany is a country in deep economic crisis. </seg>
<seg id="580"> They breathe militarism and anxiety. </seg>
<seg id="581"> She searches everywhere and asks for information ... but there is nothing to do. </seg>
<seg id="582"> After three weeks ... the authorities begin to feel suspicious. </seg>
<seg id="583"> They keep an eye on her. As he is out, he searches for his hotel room. </seg>
<seg id="584"> You spend a fourth week ... and she is about to give up and go home ... when the news of a big comedy in Munich hits her attention. </seg>
<seg id="585"> It is said to be ... the biggest gathering of Nazis ever happened. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Eudora Fletcher counts on hope ... that Zelig takes part and that, meeting her, the strong feelings ... she has always felt for her to be awakened. </seg>
<seg id="587"> At first, there does not seem to be hope. The crowd is immense. It seems impossible to be able to isolate a single face. Then suddenly a figure beside the Chancellor ... draws his attention. </seg>
<seg id="588"> Behind Hitler, on the right, recognizes Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Striving to establish a contact, he tries to cross his gaze. </seg>
<seg id="590"> Like a man awakening from a dream, Zelig notes. </seg>
<seg id="591"> In a flash, he comes back to himself. </seg>
<seg id="592"> It was not like the movie. </seg>
<seg id="593"> When Leonard got off the podium, they did not know what to think. </seg>
<seg id="594"> We did not believe in our eyes. Hitler's speech was ruined. </seg>
<seg id="595"> He wanted to make a joke about Poland ... but right then Zelig intrigued ... and Hitler was extremely upset. </seg>
<seg id="596"> The SS wanted to capture Zelig ... and if they took it ... they would probably have tortured him ... or maybe even killed. </seg>
<seg id="597"> So in general confusion ... Dr. Fletcher and Zelig left the building ... from a side door. </seg>
<seg id="598"> They took a car and they escaped ... and the SS, behind, fired. </seg>
<seg id="599"> In a rare German news story ... we can see some images of the escape. </seg>
<seg id="600"> I was flying a plane. It was wonderful. And then, suddenly, something happened. I was scared and lost control. We were rushing. </seg>
<seg id="601"> Leonard was so terrified that he changed his personality ... and since I was a pilot at that time ... he also turned him into a pilot. </seg>
<seg id="602"> Zelig takes control of the plane. By interpreting the role of a pilot ... Zelig struggles boldly to control the device. </seg>
<seg id="603"> The Germans, astonished, take us a quarter of an hour ... before arranging for a chase. </seg>
<seg id="604"> While Eudora Fletcher is senseless ... Zelig, who has never driven a plane in his life ... not only manages to escape the German pilots ... but also establishes a record, crossing the Atlantic without a stop .. . upside down. </seg>
<seg id="605"> New York celebrates Eudora Fletcher ... and Leonard Zelig, the human chameleon. </seg>
<seg id="606"> His incredible flight fills the country with pride ... and guarantees the presidential amnesty. </seg>
<seg id="607"> The crowds flock to see him next to her courageous bride promise. </seg>
<seg id="608"> Their triumphal journey ends at the City Hall. </seg>
<seg id="609"> New York City's Value Medal ... is conferred on Zelig by Carter Dean. </seg>
<seg id="610"> You are a great inspiration for the young people of this country ... who will grow one day and will be great doctors and large patients. </seg>
<seg id="611"> It's a big emotion. </seg>
<seg id="612"> I'm glad we've been alive here. </seg>
<seg id="613"> I had never done it before. It shows you what you can do ... if you're completely psychotic. </seg>
<seg id="614"> The thing is paradoxical ... because what had allowed him to accomplish this incredible enterprise ... was precisely his ability to transform. </seg>
<seg id="615"> So his illness was also the basis of his salvation ... and I find it interesting to see her in this perspective. It was his disturbance to make him a hero. </seg>
<seg id="616"> In a way it was really absurd. </seg>
<seg id="617"> I mean, he had this curious gift ... this strange feature. And for a while they all loved him ... then, people got tired of him. At that point he did that business with the plane ... and again everyone wanted to. The 1920s were basically the same. </seg>
<seg id="618"> And, if you think so well, has it changed so much, America? I do not think so. </seg>
<seg id="619"> After getting rid of infinite legal details ... </seg>
<seg id="620"> Leonard Zelig and Eudora Fletcher marry. </seg>
<seg id="621"> It's a simple ceremony, shot in amateur movies. </seg>
<seg id="622"> "Just wanting to do it well, transformed itself ..." beyond any measure, "Scott Fitzgerald wrote. </seg>
<seg id="623"> "You wonder what would happen if, from the beginning ..." he had the courage to express himself instead of pretending. </seg>
<seg id="624"> "After all, it was not the approval of the masses ..." but the love of a woman, what changed her life " </seg>
