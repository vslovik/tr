<seg id="1"> Need help! Is there anyone? </seg>
<seg id="2"> Ichabod Crane, are you? </seg>
<seg id="3"> No one else, and I'm not alone. </seg>
<seg id="4"> I found something that was recently a man. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Burn him! Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="6"> But we do not yet know the cause of death. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In the river the cause of death is drowning. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It's possible if there's water in the lungs, but with the pathology you can know if he died before finishing in the river. </seg>
<seg id="9"> - I'll have to examine the corpse. - Cut it. Are we pagans? </seg>
<seg id="10"> What happened to him? -Back for tow. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Well done. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The millennium is now at its doorstep. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In a few months we will live in the nineteenth century. But courts still use medieval torture tools. </seg>
<seg id="14"> - Sit down! - I stand it for good sense and justice. Prisons overflow with convictions for worthless confessions, such as this. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Agent Crane! </seg>
<seg id="16"> We've heard you this song more than once. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Two streets are open before me. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The first: let you refresh your ideas in a cell, until you understand the respect for the dignity of my office. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Forgive me, but how do I ever realize that we have to use the brain for essential clues to solve the crimes and resort to modern scientific techniques? </seg>
<seg id="20"> Which leads me to the second street: there is an indoor village, two days trip north, in the Hudson Islands. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It's a place called Sleepy Hollow. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Have they talked to you? - That's right. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It is a community of farmers, mostly Dutch. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Three people were killed in two weeks. </seg>
<seg id="25"> They found her with her head cut off from her torso. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Get out of my bust? Yeah, like the stem of a flower. </seg>
<seg id="27"> You will carry your modern experiments at Sleepy Hollow and you will have to get to the killer. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Bring it here, in front of our honest justice. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Will you do this? I'll do it. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Remembers, you are now, Ichabod Crane, to be put to the test. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Pickety witch. The Witch! </seg>
<seg id="32"> Who will bribe Pickety witch? </seg>
<seg id="33"> Pickety witch. Who will bribe Pickety witch? </seg>
<seg id="34"> - Is Theodore? - Forgive me, I'm a stranger. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Then, a kiss in advance. </seg>
<seg id="36"> I'm looking for Baltus Van Tassel. </seg>
<seg id="37"> I'm his daughter, Katrina Van Tassel. </seg>
<seg id="38"> We did not hear your name. I did not say that. Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="39"> You are a rude! The voice is not raised here. </seg>
<seg id="40"> It is to raise the spirit in these dark times, which I and my wife are giving this petticoat. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Young man, you're welcome even if you sell something. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Thank you sir. I'm Agent Ichabod Crane, sent from New York to investigate the murders at Sleepy Hollow. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Then Sleepy Hollow is grateful to you, Agent. </seg>
<seg id="44"> And I hope you will stay in this house. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Well said, dear. Come on, we'll set you up. Music! </seg>
<seg id="46"> Sorry, ma'am. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Thank you. Tell Mr. Van Tassel that I'll be down in a moment. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Right away, sir. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Thanks to God you are here. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Excellent, get in! Leave us, my dear. </seg>
<seg id="51"> They joined us: Dr. Lancaster, Reverend Steenwyck, Magistrate Samuel Philipse, and finally James Hardenbrook, the notary. </seg>
<seg id="52"> - And you, sir? </seg>
<seg id="53"> - A simple farmer who has been successful. </seg>
<seg id="54"> The city addresses me as a friend and adviser. </seg>
<seg id="55"> And possessor and banker. We proceed? </seg>
<seg id="56"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Then three people were assassinated. </seg>
<seg id="58"> First, Peter Van Garrett and his son Dirk Van Garrett. They were both strong and capable men. Found together, decapitated. </seg>
<seg id="59"> A week later, the Winship widow. She is also decapitated. </seg>
<seg id="60"> Now you will need to ask a lot of questions. </seg>
<seg id="61"> But before, tell me: is someone suspected? </seg>
<seg id="62"> What did your superiors explain to you? </seg>
<seg id="63"> That the three were killed in the full campaign. </seg>
<seg id="64"> The heads are separated from their bodies. </seg>
<seg id="65"> No, they were not found at all. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Have the heads gone? </seg>
<seg id="67"> They were taken by the headless knight and brought to hell. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Forgive me, I do not ... It's better that you sit down. </seg>
<seg id="69"> SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="70"> The knight was a Hessian mercenary, sent here by a German princess To hold the Americans under the yoke of England. </seg>
<seg id="71"> Unlike his compatriots who came for money, the rider came for the sake of carnage. </seg>
<seg id="72"> When you joined the battle, you found him there. </seg>
<seg id="73"> A giant black genius rode: Temerario. </seg>
<seg id="74"> He spun the horse in battle, thrusting the galloping heads. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Her teeth had been covered up to make them sharp, to make her appearance more fierce. </seg>
<seg id="76"> This butcher found its end in the winter of '79 in our forests to the west. </seg>
<seg id="77"> His head swung with his sword. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Even today, that place is infested by spirits and nobody ventures. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Because that day was planted the seed of evil. </seg>
<seg id="80"> And so it has been for twenty years. </seg>
<seg id="81"> But now he is awakened and in the fury of revenge he will cut the heads where he will find them. </seg>
<seg id="82"> Is this what you believe? </seg>
<seg id="83"> See is to believe. </seg>
<seg id="84"> You have brought equipment and books for scientific investigations. </seg>
<seg id="85"> This is the only book I recommend you read. </seg>
<seg id="86"> I see. </seg>
<seg id="87"> By telling Steenwyck, gentlemen, homicide does not need ghosts from the tomb. </seg>
<seg id="88"> We have murder in New York without goblins and spells. </seg>
<seg id="89"> You are away from New York. </seg>
<seg id="90"> The assassin is a man in flesh and bones, and I'll find it. </seg>
<seg id="91"> Come out, devil. </seg>
<seg id="92"> It's called Powder Powder. It should be fine ... </seg>
<seg id="93"> Thank you. - Good luck if you need calls. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="95"> Do not worry about anything. You will see that everything will be resolved. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Thomas, at home! </seg>
<seg id="97"> Go for breakfast. She also kisses mom for me. </seg>
<seg id="98"> The knight has killed again! </seg>
<seg id="99"> Up, Shot Powder, you leave. Power! </seg>
<seg id="100"> On the other side! </seg>
<seg id="101"> Good horse! </seg>
<seg id="102"> Mr Miller, come back with the coffin wagon. Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="103"> - Keep your eyes open. </seg>
<seg id="104"> Reassure me, there I am now. </seg>
<seg id="105"> The fourth victim, Jonathan Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="106"> I see. </seg>
<seg id="107"> And your head? </seg>
<seg id="108"> Jack. Jack. </seg>
<seg id="109"> - Very interesting. - What? </seg>
<seg id="110"> It usually removes the head to prevent identification. </seg>
<seg id="111"> But we know it's Jonathan Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="112"> Exactly. So why is the head removed? </seg>
<seg id="113"> PerchÃƒÂ ©? Exact. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Did you move the corpse? SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="115"> You never have to! PerchÃƒÂ ©? </seg>
<seg id="116"> Why not! </seg>
<seg id="117"> The swing is gigantic! </seg>
<seg id="118"> The aggressor overwhelmed Masbath, shot the horse, and went back to claim his head. </seg>
<seg id="119"> Yeah, there's a chemical reaction. </seg>
<seg id="120"> Show that there was a single, powerful shot at the neck. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Power. Interesting. - What? </seg>
<seg id="122"> The wound is instantly cauterized as if the blade was bled but there are no bruises. The devil's fire! </seg>
<seg id="123"> Beware, it is written in the first letter of St. Peter, paragraphs 5 to 8, because your opponent, the devil, runs like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour. </seg>
<seg id="124"> God welcomes Jonathan Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="125"> Mr agent! Ah, are you the young Masbath? </seg>
<seg id="126"> I was the young Masbath. Now I am the only one. </seg>
<seg id="127"> At your service. Morally forced to avenge my father. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Only and unique Masbath, thank you. But you will be more useful to your mother. </seg>
<seg id="129"> My mother is in heaven. </seg>
<seg id="130"> Now my dad cares for her, you have no one. I'm your man! - You have great courage. But I can not care about you. </seg>
<seg id="131"> I'm sorry for your loss. </seg>
<seg id="132"> - Agent Crane. Mr. Philipse. </seg>
<seg id="133"> You must know. </seg>
<seg id="134"> Jonathan Masbath was not the fourth victim, but the fifth. - The fifth? Yeah, five victims in four graves. </seg>
<seg id="135"> Young Masbath! Found a place in Van Tassel's lodgings. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Wake up before dawn. I hope you have a strong stomach. </seg>
<seg id="137"> Peter Van Garrett, Dirk Van Garrett, </seg>
<seg id="138"> Jonathan Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="139"> Five victims, four tombs. </seg>
<seg id="140"> The widow Winship. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Bring it inside the widow! </seg>
<seg id="142"> - It's an irregular thing. Yes, but necessary. </seg>
<seg id="143"> We have to work immediately. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Work? She's dead. </seg>
<seg id="145"> I mean they'll need the operating table. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Here, too, the wound on the neck is cauterized. </seg>
<seg id="147"> The sword of the stomach, as well. </seg>
<seg id="148"> But to what purpose? </seg>
<seg id="149"> What is your purpose? </seg>
<seg id="150"> What tools are these? I am of my own creation. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Go out, young Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Thank you, Mr. Killian. If you do not mind, Doctor, I can not concentrate when I'm observed. </seg>
<seg id="153"> What are they going to do? What will happen to your head? What did you do to her? </seg>
<seg id="154"> This is a mentally ill person. </seg>
<seg id="155"> What did you find out? </seg>
<seg id="156"> The Winship widow was pregnant. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Who is lÃƒÂ? </seg>
<seg id="158"> Forgive the intrusion. No intrusion. </seg>
<seg id="159"> I come here to read when they are sleepless. </seg>
<seg id="160"> Read books to hide? They were my mother. My father feels that the novels were love to kill her. </seg>
<seg id="161"> He's dead, two years in the winter. </seg>
<seg id="162"> The nurse who cares for her now is Lady Van Tassel. </seg>
<seg id="163"> There is another thing. Why did not anyone tell me that the Van Garrett are Van Tassel's relatives? </seg>
<seg id="164"> All families in Sleepy Hollow are related to blood or marriage. </seg>
<seg id="165"> I see. </seg>
<seg id="166"> This land gave the Van Garrett to my father. They were the richest family. </seg>
<seg id="167"> When we came here, Van Garrett systemed us into a land acre with a dilapidated cottage. My father works hard. She made a fortune and built this house. I need him my happiness. </seg>
<seg id="168"> I remember when we were poor in the lodge. </seg>
<seg id="169"> Do you want me to show you? SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="170"> Bring it on, it's my gift to you. </seg>
<seg id="171"> I do not need it. Are you so sure of everything? </seg>
<seg id="172"> It was your mother. Keep it close to your heart, it's a protection against evil. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Are you so sure of everything? </seg>
<seg id="174"> Strange these signs. What are? I always remember them. </seg>
<seg id="175"> As a child I played beside this fireplace. </seg>
<seg id="176"> My first drawing school. My mother was my teacher. </seg>
<seg id="177"> You see, sculpted on the chimney wall? The archer. I forgot about it. </seg>
<seg id="178"> It was long before we came here. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Do you feel good? Yeah, thank you. </seg>
<seg id="180"> A red cardinal! My favorite. </seg>
<seg id="181"> I want to tame one, but I do not feel like fooling it. </seg>
<seg id="182"> So, I got one thing for you. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Red cardinal, an empty cage. </seg>
<seg id="184"> And now... </seg>
<seg id="185"> Do you know how to make spells? Teach me! </seg>
<seg id="186"> It's not magic. That's what we call optical illusion. Separate images join in rotation. </seg>
<seg id="187"> It's the truth, but the truth is not always what appears. </seg>
<seg id="188"> What are you fleeing from, Philipse? Damn! </seg>
<seg id="189"> -Did you help me? Yeah, and now I live in terror ... of powers from which there is no defense. </seg>
<seg id="190"> How did you know Winship widow was pregnant? </seg>
<seg id="191"> - She told you. - I want you to be your father. - I'm not the father. Did you reveal the name? </seg>
<seg id="192"> SÃƒÂ¬. He came to me for a board of magistrates to protect the rights of his son. </seg>
<seg id="193"> I should have kept the secret but ... </seg>
<seg id="194"> Do you think he killed the man? - The knight killed her. </seg>
<seg id="195"> How many times do I have to tell you, there is no knight. </seg>
<seg id="196"> - What's that? - My talisman. - It protects me from the knight. </seg>
<seg id="197"> You, a magistrate, with the head full of these nonsense! Tell me the name ... </seg>
<seg id="198"> My God! </seg>
<seg id="199"> Agent Crane! </seg>
<seg id="200"> Did not go out for nothing? </seg>
<seg id="201"> - He was a headless knight! - Do not worry. </seg>
<seg id="202"> - He was a headless knight! You are here for this. </seg>
<seg id="203"> You have to believe me! Headless! </seg>
<seg id="204"> I know. - No! You were not there! </seg>
<seg id="205"> - It's all true! - We all said it. </seg>
<seg id="206"> I saw it! </seg>
<seg id="207"> I guess he'll be back in town. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Okay, this time, I'll go to New York in person. </seg>
<seg id="209"> I do not let an amateur detective run. </seg>
<seg id="210"> This time the dead man is a magistrate! </seg>
<seg id="211"> I need men capable of going to the woods to the west. </seg>
<seg id="212"> We thought you would not have more cartridges! </seg>
<seg id="213"> I have won my fears, I want to locate the knight's tomb. </seg>
<seg id="214"> In short, I'm against a murderous ghost. </seg>
<seg id="215"> Who is with me? </seg>
<seg id="216"> I. </seg>
<seg id="217"> Van Garrett, widow Winship, your father Jonathan Masbath, and now Philipse. There must be a link. </seg>
<seg id="218"> Did your dad have business with Van Garrett? </seg>
<seg id="219"> He worked for them, we lived in the shelter. There is nothing else. </seg>
<seg id="220"> But one night, one week before the murder, there was a quarrel upstairs between father and son. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Then Mr. Van Garrett called my dad. </seg>
<seg id="222"> A quarrel between father and son ... </seg>
<seg id="223"> Then Van Garrett calls the servant, Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="224"> Listen. </seg>
<seg id="225"> - I do not feel anything. Not even me. </seg>
<seg id="226"> No birds. No cricket. It's all quiet. </seg>
<seg id="227"> Accelerate your pace. </seg>
<seg id="228"> Forgive the intrusion but maybe you can help us. - Come on that mortuary? Yeah, in a way. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Precisely I do not hypothesize about your occupation. </seg>
<seg id="230"> Nothing about witch ways ... they're awesome. Yeah, awesome ways. </seg>
<seg id="231"> It's the same, whatever you are. To each his own. Do you know the knight? </seg>
<seg id="232"> That of Hessia? That one, madame! You come with me. Get out of here, baby. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Stay away, whatever you feel. </seg>
<seg id="234"> What could you feel like having to get away? He goes to Hollow and returns. I feel! I know the blood on him. - Really? </seg>
<seg id="235"> I'm here to find it And let it stop. I can give you the knowledge of the underworld. </seg>
<seg id="236"> -What do you do? Do not move, do not talk! </seg>
<seg id="237"> When the other one arrives, I'll handle it. </seg>
<seg id="238"> - The other? Is coming! </seg>
<seg id="239"> Can you hear me? </seg>
<seg id="240"> Are you looking for a knight without blood head? </seg>
<seg id="241"> Follow the Indian path until the sun dies until the dead tree. Sit down where your knight rests. </seg>
<seg id="242"> Let's go. Quickly! </seg>
<seg id="243"> Take the Indian path up to the Dead Tree. </seg>
<seg id="244"> -What do we recognize it? Without difficulty, I'm afraid. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Then get down to the place where he rests. </seg>
<seg id="246"> His camp? - His tomb. </seg>
<seg id="247"> Stay here. </seg>
<seg id="248"> Not a gesture, turn around! I got a gun! </seg>
<seg id="249"> Katrina, I could kill you! Why are you here? </seg>
<seg id="250"> Because no one wanted to follow you. </seg>
<seg id="251"> Now they are twice as strong. It's your white magic. </seg>
<seg id="252"> The dead tree. </seg>
<seg id="253"> Blood. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Stay where you are. </seg>
<seg id="255"> -What is this? Stay there, do not move! </seg>
<seg id="256"> This tree is a passage between two worlds. </seg>
<seg id="257"> The ground has been ruined. The ground is broken. </seg>
<seg id="258"> Take the shovel! </seg>
<seg id="259"> The skull has disappeared. </seg>
<seg id="260"> That's why the knight returns from the tomb. </seg>
<seg id="261"> He takes tests as long as his will not come to him. </seg>
<seg id="262"> Ichabod! </seg>
<seg id="263"> Let's split. Glenn, Theodore. </seg>
<seg id="264"> Do not tease your teeth, you will teach Thomas bad habits. </seg>
<seg id="265"> I'm a bad habit. Oh really? - That's good, and a nanna. SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Escape! </seg>
<seg id="267"> You are good. </seg>
<seg id="268"> - It's not you who you want! - I fix it! </seg>
<seg id="269"> We can not defeat him! </seg>
<seg id="270"> Such a wound would have to kill him. </seg>
<seg id="271"> But no points are needed and there is almost no blood loss. </seg>
<seg id="272"> You have to be quiet, you have the fever. </seg>
<seg id="273"> Katrina! </seg>
<seg id="274"> Nostradamus mediamus. Milk of Mercy. </seg>
<seg id="275"> I tried to stop Brom ... </seg>
<seg id="276"> Drink, you will sleep. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The knight did not want to kill Brom nÃ © me. </seg>
<seg id="278"> If Brom did not attack her! After that, rest! </seg>
<seg id="279"> I discovered that the rider did not casually knock. </seg>
<seg id="280"> His victims are chosen by someone who controls him. </seg>
<seg id="281"> The same person who took his skull. </seg>
<seg id="282"> Someone in the flesh and bones he knew where to dig. </seg>
<seg id="283"> As I have always said. They're boiling! Drink. </seg>
<seg id="284"> You were dreaming. SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="285"> Things I forgot about. </seg>
<seg id="286"> - And I do not want to remember more. - Tell me what you dreamed of. </seg>
<seg id="287"> My mother was an innocent. A daughter of nature. </seg>
<seg id="288"> Condemned, murdered ... by my father. </seg>
<seg id="289"> Murdered? To save her soul from a wicked fanatic with the mask of righteousness. </seg>
<seg id="290"> I was seven years old when I lost faith. </seg>
<seg id="291"> What do you think then? - In the criterion and in the reason. </seg>
<seg id="292"> Cause and consequence. I should not have come to this place. My rational mind has been rebuffed by the spirit world. Do not you find anything here so it's worth it to come? </seg>
<seg id="293"> No, no, no. </seg>
<seg id="294"> A kiss from a beautiful young man before he saw my face and knew my name. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Without criterion or reason. </seg>
<seg id="296"> Forgive me, I talk about kisses ... </seg>
<seg id="297"> You lost your Brom. - I poured tears for Brom, but I do not have the broken heart. - Do you find it unsuitable? - No. </seg>
<seg id="298"> Maybe there's a little witch in you. Why do you know this? Because you got me astonished. </seg>
<seg id="299"> - You slept like a dead man. Too good, I do not deserve it. </seg>
<seg id="300"> Served by the hostess. - Oh, you would not. But our servlet is gone. Sarah? Run like so many others. They go for fear. </seg>
<seg id="301"> - Where's Katrina? He watched you until dawn. Now it's up to her to sleep. </seg>
<seg id="302"> I'm ready for another day. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Enough to face a deadly adversary. </seg>
<seg id="304"> Dr. Lancaster, Reverend Steenwyck, Notary Hardenbrook, and Magistrate Philipse who tried to give us a cut and received it in which Philipse was killed. </seg>
<seg id="305"> Here is a conspiracy. </seg>
<seg id="306"> The doctor and the reverend, the notary and the magistrate. </seg>
<seg id="307"> What is the secret that keeps them united? </seg>
<seg id="308"> Philipse knew that the widow was pregnant, and did not want to tell me the father's name. </seg>
<seg id="309"> What does this mean? </seg>
<seg id="310"> We have to go for elimination. </seg>
<seg id="311"> They'll make a list of the people of Sleepy Hollow. Beginning with his first citizen, Baltus Van Tassel. </seg>
<seg id="312"> - I feel we are very close. SÃƒÂ¬. I guess Baltus is the first citizen now that Garrett is dead. SÃƒÂ¬, and Van Garrett. I almost forgot them! </seg>
<seg id="313"> - Come with me! Where? - By the notary Hardenbrook. Do you have an idea? Yeah, an idea! </seg>
<seg id="314"> Hopeless. </seg>
<seg id="315"> My dad's folder. Why is this here? </seg>
<seg id="316"> Leave me alone! Notary Hardenbrook! </seg>
<seg id="317"> As soon as you have shown Van Garrett's will. Leave everything to his son. - He died with him. Therefore inheritance goes to the closest relative. </seg>
<seg id="318"> Naturally. All legal and without cheating. -Sir! I'm a dead man! </seg>
<seg id="319"> Van Garrett's seal, broke. </seg>
<seg id="320"> He seems to have written a new one, shortly before dying, naming heir ... the widow Winship. </seg>
<seg id="321"> And here, look, a marriage certificate. </seg>
<seg id="322"> Van Garrett had secretly married the widow. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Leaving everything to her and to the unborn baby. </seg>
<seg id="324"> The new will lies between the fortunes of Van Garrett and the person who would have inherited everything. We four have been involved against our will. </seg>
<seg id="325"> You four? It means... </seg>
<seg id="326"> Of course. the four old citizens. </seg>
<seg id="327"> Now I understand the roles you had. </seg>
<seg id="328"> The Reverend Steenwyck knew the secret because he had married them, Dr. Lancaster was in charge of the pregnant woman Philipse's magistrate provided the protection of the law, and the notary Hardenbrook occult the documents that had been given by Van Garrett to his faithful servant. </seg>
<seg id="329"> The four conspirators involved in the plot. </seg>
<seg id="330"> We did not know it was a death plot! </seg>
<seg id="331"> I have not finished! </seg>
<seg id="332"> First, the Van Garrett was killed by a rider born from the grave, then a widow invokes the estate. </seg>
<seg id="333"> And away his head. But homicide is the cause of homicide. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Servant, Jonathan Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="335"> When father and son fluttered for the new testament, </seg>
<seg id="336"> Jonathan Masbath was called to be a witness. </seg>
<seg id="337"> Here is his signature. It was his death sentence. </seg>
<seg id="338"> The knight has the system. </seg>
<seg id="339"> The system was ordered by someone who had power over him. </seg>
<seg id="340"> Someone had dug in the woods to the west and stole the skull. </seg>
<seg id="341"> The missing head that must be returned to the knight. </seg>
<seg id="342"> Someone who could get or lose a fortune. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Van Garrett's closest relative: Baltus Van Tassel! </seg>
<seg id="344"> -Why are you here? - Because it's your room. </seg>
<seg id="345"> - Was it unsuitable? - No. </seg>
<seg id="346"> You missed me, where have you been? From the notary. </seg>
<seg id="347"> - I had to talk to Hardenbrook. Did you know anything? </seg>
<seg id="348"> It can be. </seg>
<seg id="349"> - My father ... your dad? Yeah, my dad thinks you should go back to New York. Really? And Why Why? </seg>
<seg id="350"> Maybe he looked at your log and did not like what he saw. </seg>
<seg id="351"> What have you got? Tests. </seg>
<seg id="352"> Now, sorry, I have to ask you ... - I leave you to your reflections. </seg>
<seg id="353"> It's just a spider. Kill him! No, hit it! </seg>
<seg id="354"> - It's something below. Thing? </seg>
<seg id="355"> Let's move the bed. I can not, do it. </seg>
<seg id="356"> The evil eye! Someone is making an invoice. </seg>
<seg id="357"> The evil eye! </seg>
<seg id="358"> Wait here. </seg>
<seg id="359"> You burned the evidence. - So you will not blame my dad. </seg>
<seg id="360"> Do not accuse anyone, but if there is any fault I can not alter the thing. Not even an invoice can alter it. </seg>
<seg id="361"> Your father takes advantage of these murders. </seg>
<seg id="362"> If I knew you would not have this opinion. </seg>
<seg id="363"> Or try something for me. - They are held back by reasoning. </seg>
<seg id="364"> What the friends conspire ... You're the agent, not me. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Find other reasonings and let me stay. </seg>
<seg id="366"> I can not do it, neither the one nor the other thing. And my heart is affrighted. I do not think you have a heart. I was thinking of giving you mine. </seg>
<seg id="367"> SÃƒÂ¬. You loved me to follow me in the woods and to face that danger. </seg>
<seg id="368"> There was no danger to me if my father controlled the knight. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Goodbye. Malay the day you came to Sleepy Hollow! </seg>
<seg id="370"> - Katrina will not see you. Did not say anything? </seg>
<seg id="371"> Only that will not come down. </seg>
<seg id="372"> I understand, thank you. - Agent! </seg>
<seg id="373"> You have not asked me yet how badly I was in my hand, it would have been very kind. </seg>
<seg id="374"> You have been careful not to look at it and not talk about it. </seg>
<seg id="375"> I regret. How did you ... - I know you've seen me! Thing? - You followed me last night. </seg>
<seg id="376"> You promise not to tell my husband. Promise! </seg>
<seg id="377"> The city is in a hurry. Hardenbrook is dead! </seg>
<seg id="378"> That old-fashioned old man? - He's hanged tonight. Hanged? </seg>
<seg id="379"> Steenwyck called for a church assembly for tonight. </seg>
<seg id="380"> Every woman, man or child will pronounce against you! </seg>
<seg id="381"> If you are wise, leave this place! </seg>
<seg id="382"> Cos'ÃƒÂ¨? I was flabbergasted with the kitchen knife. </seg>
<seg id="383"> - The wound looks serious. - Later the fascia with wild maranas. I know where they grow. </seg>
<seg id="384"> Hurry up! The bell of the assembly rattles! </seg>
<seg id="385"> - The Knight! Katrina! Father! </seg>
<seg id="386"> Save me! </seg>
<seg id="387"> He killed your stepmother! God! </seg>
<seg id="388"> Fire! </seg>
<seg id="389"> You will kill us all! It is you who wants it! </seg>
<seg id="390"> Can not come in! </seg>
<seg id="391"> Can not come in! - Why should we die for you? </seg>
<seg id="392"> - Can not cross the gate! We have to save ourselves! </seg>
<seg id="393"> The next one touched me, will have a bullet! </seg>
<seg id="394"> Do not go! </seg>
<seg id="395"> There have been dead days. We confess our sins. </seg>
<seg id="396"> - What do you know? - They told you the fake. </seg>
<seg id="397"> We have been possessed diabolically by ... </seg>
<seg id="398"> Get away! Back! </seg>
<seg id="399"> Back! </seg>
<seg id="400"> Here is a conspiracy! I'll smash it! </seg>
<seg id="401"> An evil spirit possessed you. </seg>
<seg id="402"> Please God that you are satisfied and that you are in peace. </seg>
<seg id="403"> The evil eye did his job. My life is over. Saved for a life of horrors in sleep and awakening aches. </seg>
<seg id="404"> Goodbye, Katrina. </seg>
<seg id="405"> Believe it was Katrina, did not it? You never have to say it! </seg>
<seg id="406"> Strange kind of witch, with a loving and kind heart. </seg>
<seg id="407"> - How can you think that? - I have a good reason. </seg>
<seg id="408"> You are scared of reason. - I'm down to reason. </seg>
<seg id="409"> It's a tough lesson for a tough world. Learn it well. </seg>
<seg id="410"> Infamy has many masks. The most dangerous is the virtue. </seg>
<seg id="411"> Goodbye. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Get the carriage, go back! </seg>
<seg id="413"> Forgive me! </seg>
<seg id="414"> No blood nor coagulation nor scratching. When the cut was done this woman was dead. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Adorable child, you have the air of seeing a ghost. </seg>
<seg id="416"> Again, my dark genius. </seg>
<seg id="417"> Another night of decapitation. Get up with your sword! </seg>
<seg id="418"> One head for a head. </seg>
<seg id="419"> My sacrilegious knight, come on! </seg>
<seg id="420"> Come on now for ... Katrina! </seg>
<seg id="421"> Finally wake up! Did you think it was a bad dream? </seg>
<seg id="422"> Dad saw the knight kill you! </seg>
<seg id="423"> He saw the rider coming toward me with his sword pulled. But I'm the governor of the knight. </seg>
<seg id="424"> And Baltus did not look at it. </seg>
<seg id="425"> But there was a corpse! Serve, Sarah. </seg>
<seg id="426"> I've always found it useless. </seg>
<seg id="427"> But a utility has demonstrated it. </seg>
<seg id="428"> Who are you? The name of my family ... was Archer. The archer! </seg>
<seg id="429"> I lived with my father, my mother and sister not far from here. As long as my father died. And the landlord we had always served faithfully, we'll bust. </seg>
<seg id="430"> No one wanted to welcome us because my mother was suspected of witchcraft. </seg>
<seg id="431"> But she instruct her daughters at art, while we were living in the woods to the west. </seg>
<seg id="432"> MorÃƒÂ¬ within a year. </seg>
<seg id="433"> My sister and I stayed in our shelter. </seg>
<seg id="434"> Without seeing a soul, until one day ... gathering wood, we met the Hessian mercenary. </seg>
<seg id="435"> I saw his death. </seg>
<seg id="436"> At that moment I offered my soul to Satan, if he had risen the knight to avenge me. </seg>
<seg id="437"> Revenge? Yeah, of Van Garrett. </seg>
<seg id="438"> He had no pity and hunger for us, while Baltus Van Tassel with his wife and daughter was rubbing us home. </seg>
<seg id="439"> I swear I would become the mistress of everything she had. </seg>
<seg id="440"> It was easy. I came into your house as your nurse's nurse, put my body in a coffin and mine in my double bed. </seg>
<seg id="441"> It was not so easy to secure my legacy. </seg>
<seg id="442"> The widow had to disappear, of course </seg>
<seg id="443"> and also the servant Masbath. Then days later, midwife Killian told me that the widow had revealed a secret to her. </seg>
<seg id="444"> She told me right in front of her husband, what a goof! </seg>
<seg id="445"> Another work for the knight. </seg>
<seg id="446"> Lust has led the Reverend Steenwyck in my power. </seg>
<seg id="447"> Fear did the same with Hardenbrook and Philipse. </seg>
<seg id="448"> And the doctor's silence I got in exchange for my complicity, in her fornication with Sarah servant. </seg>
<seg id="449"> Yeah, you got it all right now. - No. </seg>
<seg id="450"> You have everything, dear, to your father's will. I'll have it all with your death. </seg>
<seg id="451"> By the way, my sister suddenly died. </seg>
<seg id="452"> Rather recently. </seg>
<seg id="453"> Did you kill your sister? - She wanted it herself. Helping you and your master. </seg>
<seg id="454"> Just in time To make you cut your head. </seg>
<seg id="455"> The rider arrives and tonight is for you! </seg>
<seg id="456"> Thank God! </seg>
<seg id="457"> Beware of the head! </seg>
<seg id="458"> On the roof! I have an idea. </seg>
<seg id="459"> Jump on the blades! </seg>
<seg id="460"> Jump! </seg>
<seg id="461"> Soon! </seg>
<seg id="462"> Is dead? The problem was that he was dead. </seg>
<seg id="463"> - Where do we go? Get out of here! </seg>
<seg id="464"> Get the reins! </seg>
<seg id="465"> Ichabod! </seg>
<seg id="466"> The bag! </seg>
<seg id="467"> Jump! </seg>
<seg id="468"> - Still alive? Scappa, Katrina! </seg>
<seg id="469"> Yeah, go, jump and jump! </seg>
<seg id="470"> Take it, it's yours! </seg>
<seg id="471"> You're not dead! </seg>
<seg id="472"> Knight! </seg>
<seg id="473"> Just in time for the new century! </seg>
<seg id="474"> You will soon be going, young Masbath. </seg>
<seg id="475"> The Bronx is up, Battery down and home is here. </seg>
