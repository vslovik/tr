<seg id="1"> On January 11 at 2:30 pm ... </seg>
<seg id="2"> This is our memory, then you will do yours. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Following a bombardment at Brooklyn Bridge Park ... </seg>
<seg id="4"> Zachary Cowan, 11, armed with a stick, ... </seg>
<seg id="5"> He hit our son, Ethan Longstreet, in the face. </seg>
<seg id="6"> (Pen) This gesture, in addition to the swelling of the upper lip, ... </seg>
<seg id="7"> He caused the breaks of the two incisors ... </seg>
<seg id="8"> .. and compromised the nerve of the right incisor. </seg>
<seg id="9"> - Armed? </seg>
<seg id="10"> - Do not you like "armed"? </seg>
<seg id="11"> Michael, how can you say, "What's a stick?" </seg>
<seg id="12"> - "What had" ... yeah. - "What a Stick!" </seg>
<seg id="13"> - "Which had"... </seg>
<seg id="14"> We thought the Brooklyn Bridge Park was more secure than Hillside. </seg>
<seg id="15"> We've always said, "The Brooklyn Bridge Park is fine, Hillside no." </seg>
<seg id="16"> - Unbelievable! </seg>
<seg id="17"> Thank you for coming ... </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is much better not to let yourself be carried away by your own emotionality. </seg>
<seg id="19"> We are thanking you. </seg>
<seg id="20"> We do not have to thank each other for each other. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Fortunately, there is still an idea of ​​civil coexistence, is not it? </seg>
<seg id="22"> Yeah, even if our children have not grabbed the concept well. </seg>
<seg id="23"> -Also, not ours. -Our ... not ours! </seg>
<seg id="24"> Those tulips are gorgeous. </seg>
<seg id="25"> I took them from the florist on top of Henry. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Sure! </seg>
<seg id="27"> It makes them come from Holland, </seg>
<seg id="28"> - Cheap. - SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Did you understand what it is? - Sure. </seg>
<seg id="30"> What will happen to the tooth with compromised nerve? </seg>
<seg id="31"> You do not know yet. At present, the prognosis has not been dissolved. </seg>
<seg id="32"> It seems that the nerve ... is not completely uncovered. </seg>
<seg id="33"> - It's only partially. - (Pen) There is a discovery and a protected part. </seg>
<seg id="34"> - Do not devalue them for now. - So the tooth can heal. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Yeah, to avoid a canal cure. </seg>
<seg id="36"> -Of course! For a while, they will keep the nerve in sight. </seg>
<seg id="37"> - They will put capsules on it ... - No plants up to 18 years old. </seg>
<seg id="38"> - You can not. </seg>
<seg id="39"> You can only put it at the end of development. </seg>
<seg id="40"> It's natural. Well, we hope everything goes for the best. </seg>
<seg id="41"> We can only hope. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Listen ... Ethan ... did not want to accuse Zachary. </seg>
<seg id="43"> No, he did not want to! </seg>
<seg id="44"> It was amazing to see this disfigured little boy, with no teeth, ... </seg>
<seg id="45"> .. who refused to speak. </seg>
<seg id="46"> I can imagine. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Well, in truth, he did not want to go by spy, it was not just a sense of honor! </seg>
<seg id="48"> Honor requires a suitable social environment. </seg>
<seg id="49"> How did you get the name of Zachary? </seg>
<seg id="50"> We explained to Ethan that, protecting him, he would not have helped. </seg>
<seg id="51"> We told him: "If he lets him beat others, he will continue." </seg>
<seg id="52"> If we were the parents of that child, we would have wanted to know it. </seg>
<seg id="53"> - Obviously. - SÃƒÂ¬. Excuse me for a moment. </seg>
<seg id="54"> SÃƒÂ¬, Walter? Thank you for recalling me. </seg>
<seg id="55"> It's on the "Journal" this morning, I read it. </seg>
<seg id="56"> "According to a study published in 'Lancet ... there have been some neurological side effects ... of Antril, the drug against hypertension ... ranging from lowering hearing to atassia." </seg>
<seg id="57"> Who the hell is holding the print, huh? </seg>
<seg id="58"> Yeah, you're in shit. </seg>
<seg id="59"> The problem is that the general shareholders' meeting is in two weeks </seg>
<seg id="60"> - Sorry. - So she's ... - Lawyer. </seg>
<seg id="61"> - And you, on the other hand? -Thanking home articles. </seg>
<seg id="62"> - She is a writer and works part-time in an art library. </seg>
<seg id="63"> - Writer! </seg>
<seg id="64"> I participated in a collective work on Saba and her civilization, ... </seg>
<seg id="65"> ... from the recovery of the excavations after the war between Eritrea and Ethiopia. </seg>
<seg id="66"> But now I'm working on a book on Darfur's tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="67"> - An expert in Africa. </seg>
<seg id="68"> - I'm interested in that part of the world. </seg>
<seg id="69"> Do you have other children? -SÃ¬, Courtney, nine years old. </seg>
<seg id="70"> (Pen) She has her with her father because she has been released from the hamster yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="71"> - Is he released from the hamster? -SÃƒÂ¬! It was very loud at night. </seg>
<seg id="72"> They sleep in the daytime. </seg>
<seg id="73"> Ethan was hysterical, he could not bear the whole chaos. </seg>
<seg id="74"> Actually, I too could not wait to get rid of it. </seg>
<seg id="75"> I caught it and I dropped it in the street. </seg>
<seg id="76"> - Did you give it up in the street? - I thought they were sewage animals! </seg>
<seg id="77"> ln reality, on the sidewalk, that thing was petrified! </seg>
<seg id="78"> They are not wild or domestic, you do not know where to throw them! </seg>
<seg id="79"> So she ... abandoned him out there? </seg>
<seg id="80"> Yeah, and she tried to let Courtney believe she had run away. </seg>
<seg id="81"> she did not believe it. </seg>
<seg id="82"> - And this morning, the hamster was "gone". - That's right. </seg>
<seg id="83"> - What do you do about it? - They are a financial operator. </seg>
<seg id="84"> Um ... let me make a direct question. </seg>
<seg id="85"> - Zachary can apologize to Ethan? </seg>
<seg id="86"> - Sure. They have to meet. </seg>
<seg id="87"> You have to apologize, Alan! If nothing else, you must say he is sorry. </seg>
<seg id="88"> - It is probable. - Ma Ã¨ cosÃƒÂ¬? Are you sorry? </seg>
<seg id="89"> She does not realize the gravity of her gesture, she's only 11 years old. </seg>
<seg id="90"> - At age 11 there are no more children. - But not adults! </seg>
<seg id="91"> Do you want a cafe or a tea? </seg>
<seg id="92"> Was it a bit of fruit cake? Make a cake crazy! </seg>
<seg id="93"> - Can I have an espresso? - Sure. - I would like. </seg>
<seg id="94"> - A glass of water. - Also for me an espresso and bring the cake! Come. </seg>
<seg id="95"> Please make yourselves comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="96"> - Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="97"> You have to taste that cake! </seg>
<seg id="98"> Where's the cake? </seg>
<seg id="99"> He put it back in the fridge. In what language do I have to speak to that woman? </seg>
<seg id="100"> - What a lovely couple. - Very. </seg>
<seg id="101"> - They're cute, right? - Do you tell everyone I'm a writer? </seg>
<seg id="102"> - You did, you wrote a book! </seg>
<seg id="103"> It's not easy to make a good fruit cake. </seg>
<seg id="104"> - What does it sell? - Ornamental items: locks, handles, copper objects. And kitchen utensils: pots and pans. </seg>
<seg id="105"> And do you earn well? "I have not had particularly exciting years. At first it was tough. </seg>
<seg id="106"> ..I am going out every morning with the sample and the catalog, field! </seg>
<seg id="107"> - Cast iron pans have a peak at Christmas. </seg>
<seg id="108"> When did he see the scared hamster, why did not he bring him home? </seg>
<seg id="109"> - I do not touch them like that. - He put it on the sidewalk. </seg>
<seg id="110"> It was in the box, I dropped it. I can not really touch them. </seg>
<seg id="111"> - Sugar? - No, no sugar. </seg>
<seg id="112"> - What fruit put into the cake? - Apples and pears. </seg>
<seg id="113"> - Apples and pears? - SÃƒÂ¬. It's my little recipe. </seg>
<seg id="114"> - Apples and pears ... It's a novelty for me. </seg>
<seg id="115"> - It's a classic, but there is a secret. - Oh, really? </seg>
<seg id="116"> You have to cut the largest pears of apples, because they bake before. </seg>
<seg id="117"> - Oh, here! - It's not the real secret. - Let's taste it! </seg>
<seg id="118"> - Really good. - Exquisite. - Crushed gingerbread. </seg>
<seg id="119"> - Oh God! - It's the original recipe, just a little more elaborate. - He gave me his mother. </seg>
<seg id="120"> - Gingerbread! Fantastic. </seg>
<seg id="121"> At least, this trouble made us discover a new recipe. </seg>
<seg id="122"> If my son did not give us two teeth it was better. </seg>
<seg id="123"> - That was what I meant. -It is a way of expressing it. </seg>
<seg id="124"> I'm sorry. </seg>
<seg id="125"> SÃƒÂ¬, Walter? </seg>
<seg id="126"> No, no letter to the director. </seg>
<seg id="127"> We do not burn controversy. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Do you have coverage? So?! </seg>
<seg id="129"> What kind of disturbances are there? What is the atassia? </seg>
<seg id="130"> And with normal doses? </seg>
<seg id="131"> How far do you know it? Why did not you retreat, then? </seg>
<seg id="132"> Which business tour is it about? Oh, I understand! </seg>
<seg id="133"> - Alan? We are waiting. - I'll come in for a moment. </seg>
<seg id="134"> Dennis? </seg>
<seg id="135"> They were aware of the risks for two and a half years. </seg>
<seg id="136"> An internal communication, where side effects are not specified. No precautionary measure, no coverage, and no annual report. </seg>
<seg id="137"> Lack of balance, slow motion in practice, you move like a drunk. </seg>
<seg id="138"> About half a billion of turnover. </seg>
<seg id="139"> You are there? </seg>
<seg id="140"> Deny! </seg>
<seg id="141"> That whimper wanted to write to the editor of the newspaper. </seg>
<seg id="142"> You do not write to any newspaper. </seg>
<seg id="143"> Anyway, in the event of a reaction, we will release a statement, such as "False voices circulate two weeks from the General Assembly". </seg>
<seg id="144"> No, he reminds me so much. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Ok. </seg>
<seg id="146"> - Today I could not have lunch. </seg>
<seg id="147"> - Oh, serve it as well! Take. </seg>
<seg id="148"> - Here it is. </seg>
<seg id="149"> I know it's not the way to behave. We were saying? </seg>
<seg id="150"> We said it would be better to know us in different circumstances. </seg>
<seg id="151"> - So this cake is her mother? - His mother! </seg>
<seg id="152"> The recipe is my mother, but Pen has made it. </seg>
<seg id="153"> - Your mother does not use apples and pears. - No. </seg>
<seg id="154"> - It's about to be operated. - Oh, what? </seg>
<seg id="155"> - To the knee. </seg>
<seg id="156"> They will put a rotary polyethylene and metal denture. </seg>
<seg id="157"> And she wants to know what will remain after the cremation! </seg>
<seg id="158"> Do not be naughty. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Instead of being buried near my father, he wants to be cremated and brought to the north, near the mother, who is alone. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A pair of urns chatting infinitely over the banks of a lake. </seg>
<seg id="161"> We are very impressed with your availability. </seg>
<seg id="162"> We know you want to make things easier, instead of exasperating them. </seg>
<seg id="163"> - It's the least we can do. - SÃƒÂ¬! </seg>
<seg id="164"> There are so many parents who take the children's part, becoming more infant than they are. </seg>
<seg id="165"> If Ethan had broken two teeth at Zachary, maybe we would have reacted badly. </seg>
<seg id="166"> - What if we had your width of views? - Yes, yes. </seg>
<seg id="167"> - I doubt it. - Yeah, because we could've been in your place. </seg>
<seg id="168"> What does Zachary say about this story? How did he get it? </seg>
<seg id="169"> Does not say much, I think it's confused. </seg>
<seg id="170"> - Do you realize you've disfigured a companion? </seg>
<seg id="171"> No! No, you do not realize you have ... "disfigured" your companion! </seg>
<seg id="172"> Why do you say so? Of course he realizes it. </seg>
<seg id="173"> She realizes that violent behavior is not permissible, but she has not disfigured anyone. </seg>
<seg id="174"> Unfortunately, the word is appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="175"> - My son did not disfigure your son. - On the contrary, he did! </seg>
<seg id="176"> - I'll go back to school and see you. - It is momentarily disfigured. </seg>
<seg id="177"> Your mouth will come back soon. </seg>
<seg id="178"> For teeth we will pay the best dentist. </seg>
<seg id="179"> There is insurance. </seg>
<seg id="180"> We just want to make peace and that there is not much more. </seg>
<seg id="181"> - Then we set a meeting. - SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="182"> - With us present? </seg>
<seg id="183"> - They do not need protectors. If they will shake it from men. - Stop it. </seg>
<seg id="184"> Perhaps it is true, maybe we should not be there. I think it's better. </seg>
<seg id="185"> The question is not whether or not to be there ... but if they want to talk and clarify. </seg>
<seg id="186"> - Ethan, sÃƒÂ¬. - And Zachary? </seg>
<seg id="187"> - There will be no choice. But he must leave him. </seg>
<seg id="188"> He acted as a thug, do not expect us to start thinking. </seg>
<seg id="189"> If Zachary sees Ethan in a punitive context, because he's forced ... I do not see how the result can be positive. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Our son is a crazy person ... she is deluded if she hopes to apologize spontaneously. </seg>
<seg id="191"> Sorry, I have to go back to the office ... but you, Nancy, stay here, so make a decision, so much I would not be useful. </seg>
<seg id="192"> Women think that the man, his father, is needed, as if he were to serve something. </seg>
<seg id="193"> Sorry, but I have to go too. </seg>
<seg id="194"> My husband has never been a pope he liked to push the stroller. </seg>
<seg id="195"> Too bad, they grow so fast! You liked being with the kids. </seg>
<seg id="196"> - He loved to push the stroller. - Sure. </seg>
<seg id="197"> So what do we do? </seg>
<seg id="198"> - Can you go to us at 19:30 with Ethan? </seg>
<seg id="199"> - Well, if you want my opinion ... - Yeah, please. </seg>
<seg id="200"> It's Zachary who should come here. </seg>
<seg id="201"> The victim should not get uncomfortable. </seg>
<seg id="202"> At 19:30 I can not be there. Who needs you? You're not useful. </seg>
<seg id="203"> - I think it's important that there is also the father. - But not tonight. </seg>
<seg id="204"> - Do you feel me now? </seg>
<seg id="205"> The annual report does not mention it, but the risk is not ascertained. There is no evidence. Make me call back from him. </seg>
<seg id="206"> - Tomorrow? - Tomorrow I'm in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="207"> Do you have customers in Washington? - The Pentagon. </seg>
<seg id="208"> The important thing is for the kids to meet. </seg>
<seg id="209"> I'll be here with Zachary at 7:30 pm. Let the kids clarify. </seg>
<seg id="210"> What's that? I do not feel convinced. </seg>
<seg id="211"> If Zachary does not come here already accountable ... they will look cagnesco! </seg>
<seg id="212"> - Already accountable? But what do you talk about? - Zachary is not crazy. - It's not a crazy person! - Lo Ã¨. </seg>
<seg id="213"> - Do not be crazy. Why do you say so? </seg>
<seg id="214"> - It's crazy. - How do you explain his gesture? - Do not talk about it. </seg>
<seg id="215"> - But it should. - She says a little bit of "should." </seg>
<seg id="216"> "He should come, he should talk, he should apologize ..." </seg>
<seg id="217"> He will be more competent than us. </seg>
<seg id="218"> We will try to improve, but she is indulgent. </seg>
<seg id="219"> Hey! Come on! But what happens now? </seg>
<seg id="220"> - That was not the purpose. - I'm telling him about Zachary. </seg>
<seg id="221"> - I understood it, thank you! - Alan! </seg>
<seg id="222"> - You want another cafe? A good coffee. -CaffÃƒÂ¨ ... </seg>
<seg id="223"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="224"> - A cafe, okay. -Tranquilla, Pen, I think about it. </seg>
<seg id="225"> - I see you're interested in art. - SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="226"> - Bacon. - SÃƒÂ¬, Bacon. </seg>
<seg id="227"> - "CrudeltÃ ° e splendore"! - "Chaos and Balance". </seg>
<seg id="228"> -Zachary is interested in art? - Not what it should. And her children? </seg>
<seg id="229"> - Let's fill the inevitable school gaps. </seg>
<seg id="230"> - We bring them to concerts and exhibitions. </seg>
<seg id="231"> - We believe that culture is a powerful force for peace. </seg>
<seg id="232"> - Right. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Is it a cake or a tart, if it's stuffed? It's important... </seg>
<seg id="234"> I thought, "Can the pizza be called 'tart'?" </seg>
<seg id="235"> This is a pie, the tart has the base of pastafrolla. </seg>
<seg id="236"> - She's a cook overwhelmed. - I like cooking. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Or you do it for passion or not ... </seg>
<seg id="238"> .. and I say it is tart if it has the pastafrolla base. </seg>
<seg id="239"> - Do you have other children? </seg>
<seg id="240"> - I have a son from a previous marriage. </seg>
<seg id="241"> I was wondering, although I know it's not important, ... </seg>
<seg id="242"> ... you know what the reason is, because Ethan does not say anything. </seg>
<seg id="243"> Ethan did not want to get Zachary into his gang. - Does Ethan have one? </seg>
<seg id="244"> - And he gave him the spy. - Did you know Ethan has a band? </seg>
<seg id="245"> - No, but I'm having fun! </seg>
<seg id="246"> - Why do you enjoy it? - I had one too, I was the boss. - Me too. </seg>
<seg id="247"> And who is the head of a band? </seg>
<seg id="248"> Have some little boy who admires you, ready to sacrifice for you ... </seg>
<seg id="249"> - Like in "Ivanhoe". - That's right! </seg>
<seg id="250"> - But who knows more "Ivanhoe" ?! - There are now models like Spiderman. </seg>
<seg id="251"> Then you know more of us ... </seg>
<seg id="252"> So Zachary has not been so silent. </seg>
<seg id="253"> Why did he give him a spy? </seg>
<seg id="254"> Let yourself be, it's a curiosity, this is not the point, we do not care. </seg>
<seg id="255"> - Better do not pinch </seg>
<seg id="256"> - It does not concern us. - Exactly. </seg>
<seg id="257"> What we are all about is this incident: violence concerns us. </seg>
<seg id="258"> When I was headed, I beat Jimmy Lich, barking ... ... and he was more than I was. </seg>
<seg id="259"> - What's this all about? - Nothing. </seg>
<seg id="260"> - They did not bother. </seg>
<seg id="261"> - Sure. It was just a reminder. - There is not much difference. </seg>
<seg id="262"> - Excuse me, but what is it? - There's a difference. </seg>
<seg id="263"> - And what is it? - I and Jimmy wanted to do it. </seg>
<seg id="264"> - Did it hurt you badly? - Just a little bit. </seg>
<seg id="265"> Just with Jimmy Lich. Are you sorry ... if I talk to Zachary? </seg>
<seg id="266"> - Of course not. - I would never do it without your permission. </seg>
<seg id="267"> - Talk to him, okay for us. - With best wishes... </seg>
<seg id="268"> Stop it, Alan. Why do you say so? </seg>
<seg id="269"> - Mrs. Longstreet ... - Penelope! No formalities. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Penelope ... she acts with the desire to educate ... </seg>
<seg id="271"> - If you prefer, I do not talk to him. - No, do whatever he wants. </seg>
<seg id="272"> It's weird that she feels so involved. </seg>
<seg id="273"> - Mrs. Longstreet ... - Penelope! </seg>
<seg id="274"> Penelope, I'm involved. My son hurt another kid. </seg>
<seg id="275"> - Intentionally. - These things irritate me ... Intentionally, yes. </seg>
<seg id="276"> - That makes a difference. - The difference between what and what? </seg>
<seg id="277"> Our son has beaten yours, so we're here. </seg>
<seg id="278"> - It's useless. - It's true, talking so is useless. </seg>
<seg id="279"> So what lesson do you want to teach me using the word "intentionally"? </seg>
<seg id="280"> So the conversation is ridiculous. </seg>
<seg id="281"> My husband is stressed out for work issues. </seg>
<seg id="282"> I'll be back tonight with Zachary and let everything get resolved. </seg>
<seg id="283"> - I'm not stressed. - Well, I do. </seg>
<seg id="284"> - There is no reason to be stressed. - Yes, instead. - SÃƒÂ¬? </seg>
<seg id="285"> Well, no comment. No comment! </seg>
<seg id="286"> No comment! </seg>
<seg id="287"> Thing?! To withdraw it is how to admit responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="288"> Retreating Antril would be like admitting responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="289"> In the Christmas recitation at school, what did Zachary do? </seg>
<seg id="290"> - The part of Ebenezer Scrooge. - Ebenezer Scrooge ... It's true! </seg>
<seg id="291"> - Michael, remember when he did Scrooge? -Sure. </seg>
<seg id="292"> - It was wonderful. - With that hat ... </seg>
<seg id="293"> We will deal with the patients after ... </seg>
<seg id="294"> We can not withdraw a medication because three guys can not walk straight! </seg>
<seg id="295"> For now, do nothing. </seg>
<seg id="296"> All right, I'll call you. </seg>
<seg id="297"> I'm panicked! Printing is with his breath on his neck. I want a statement that does not have to sound like a denial. Let's talk about it, let's attack them, like: ... .. "TW Pharma is the victim of a stock price manipulation ..." "... two weeks from the shareholders' meeting." And then, "Why does this story jump out of nowhere?" </seg>
<seg id="298"> Not a word on the question "health", only one question: ... .. "Who is behind this investigation?" </seg>
<seg id="299"> Good. </seg>
<seg id="300"> Nobody forced me to listen to my phone calls. </seg>
<seg id="301"> Nobody forced her to put them under my nose. </seg>
<seg id="302"> You're wrong, I'm forced to do it here and against my will. </seg>
<seg id="303"> GiÃƒÂ ... They sell their shit and then they wash their hands. </seg>
<seg id="304"> In the field of therapeutics, any progress involves benefits and risks. </seg>
<seg id="305"> I know, anyway ... you do an ambiguous job. </seg>
<seg id="306"> - What does it mean? - Michael, they are not our business. </seg>
<seg id="307"> - It's an ambiguous craft. - And what do you do? </seg>
<seg id="308"> - A normal craft. - And what is a normal craft? </seg>
<seg id="309"> - I sell pots and pans. - And door handles. </seg>
<seg id="310"> - And flushing devices and more. </seg>
<seg id="311"> - Dishwashing Devices: Interesting! </seg>
<seg id="312"> - Toilet flushes are interesting. - Why not? </seg>
<seg id="313"> Are there many different types? </seg>
<seg id="314"> - The basics are two: thrusters and manual ones. </seg>
<seg id="315"> - Of course ... - Depends on the pressure of the water. </seg>
<seg id="316"> - Clear! - That is, if the pipe is up or down. </seg>
<seg id="317"> If you want, I'll show you a warehouse worker who is an expert, but he's in Queens. </seg>
<seg id="318"> - He knows his job well. </seg>
<seg id="319"> - Do you think about punishing Zachary? </seg>
<seg id="320"> - I do not feel well. - What do you hear? </seg>
<seg id="321"> - You're pale. It is white as a sheet. </seg>
<seg id="322"> - I feel nauseous. - It takes Reglan. </seg>
<seg id="323"> - No, now go. - It's a Coca-Cola. </seg>
<seg id="324"> And hot. </seg>
<seg id="325"> - And hot. - Thank you. Is it safe? </seg>
<seg id="326"> - In small pits. - Coca-Cola was not in the fridge. </seg>
<seg id="327"> Call me right away. </seg>
<seg id="328"> - Does Coca-Cola work? Is not it more suitable for diarrhea? - Not only. Better? </seg>
<seg id="329"> I'd say so. Mrs. Longstreet ... </seg>
<seg id="330"> If we decided to scold our son ... we would like to do it in our own way, in the most appropriate way for us. </seg>
<seg id="331"> - We would miss it! - As? </seg>
<seg id="332"> - They are free to do as they believe. </seg>
<seg id="333"> - I do not agree. - On what?! </seg>
<seg id="334"> - I'm not free. In what sense, please? Keep on ... Sorry. SÃƒÂ¬? Perfect. </seg>
<seg id="335"> Yeah, but do not forget that there are no tests and secrecy. </seg>
<seg id="336"> Do not bullshit. </seg>
<seg id="337"> If we're wrong, Walter will end up with his ass on the floor and we'll be with him. </seg>
<seg id="338"> All right with this phone, Alan! You're here with us, cow cow! </seg>
<seg id="339"> Call me and read it. </seg>
<seg id="340"> Are you crazy? You started shouting like a hen. Dennis heard. </seg>
<seg id="341"> Good! I'm tired of that shit shit. Always, day and night! </seg>
<seg id="342"> You should thank me. I've made an effort to come here. </seg>
<seg id="343"> - Really? - I'm about to vomit. - I do not believe it. </seg>
<seg id="344"> - But sÃƒÂ¬. - Do you want to go to the bathroom? </seg>
<seg id="345"> - No one obliges you to stay. Exactly: It is not obligatory! </seg>
<seg id="346"> - It turns everything. - Look at a fixed point ... </seg>
<seg id="347"> - You see a part of the "L" line. - Go away! Leave me alone! </seg>
<seg id="348"> - Should not you go to the bathroom? - Go to the bathroom, if you have to vomit. </seg>
<seg id="349"> - From the Reglan. - Will it be sweet? </seg>
<seg id="350"> - No, I did yesterday. - Do not touch me! </seg>
<seg id="351"> - Calm down. - Do not take it for nothing. </seg>
<seg id="352"> For my husband, it is up to me to take care of home, school and garden! - It's not so. </seg>
<seg id="353"> - That's right, and I understand why it's so boring and deadly! </seg>
<seg id="354"> If it is dead, why do children do it? </seg>
<seg id="355"> Perhaps Zachary perceives your disinterest. </seg>
<seg id="356"> - But what disinterestedness ?! - She just said that. </seg>
<seg id="357"> Get a bucket! </seg>
<seg id="358"> Stupid bitch! </seg>
<seg id="359"> - You had to go to the bathroom, "Doodle" ... - She made her with her. </seg>
<seg id="360"> - Thing? - It was not my cake. </seg>
<seg id="361"> - Of course not, it's a nervous fact. </seg>
<seg id="362"> - If you like, I'll show you the bathroom. </seg>
<seg id="363"> Oh ... My Kokoschka! </seg>
<seg id="364"> - From the Reglan! - Now he can not keep anything inside. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Where's the bath? </seg>
<seg id="366"> I'll take you. </seg>
<seg id="367"> It's just nerves. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="369"> We can not dominate something that dominates us. </seg>
<seg id="370"> I always clench my neck. </seg>
<seg id="371"> Here it is. How do you do with the Kokoschka? Clean it, maybe with lioform. </seg>
<seg id="372"> The problem is to dry it. - Clean it with water and spray the colony. </seg>
<seg id="373"> - Colony ?! - There is my Kouros, which I never use. Pages will burst. </seg>
<seg id="374"> We dry them, then we crush them with books ... ... or we squeeze them out, as they do with the dollars. </seg>
<seg id="375"> -Oh God. - I'll get it another. </seg>
<seg id="376"> - It's unobtainable for years. </seg>
<seg id="377"> - I'm very sorry. - I'll save him. Let me do it. </seg>
<seg id="378"> It is the reprint of a catalog of an exhibition in London in London. </seg>
<seg id="379"> Get the phon and the colony, it's in the bathroom. </seg>
<seg id="380"> - Her husband is in the bathroom. - But it's not the crap! </seg>
<seg id="381"> I took it off almost everything, there was only a bit left over Dolgani. </seg>
<seg id="382"> Excuse me? </seg>
<seg id="383"> - Do you feel better? -SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="384"> - Where do I spray it? - Where's the phon? </seg>
<seg id="385"> - She's drying her pants. </seg>
<seg id="386"> - So let's wait for Kouros to come to an end. - Okay. </seg>
<seg id="387"> - Can I go to the bathroom too? - Yeah, of course ... of course. </seg>
<seg id="388"> I do not know what to say. </seg>
<seg id="389"> You have to excuse me. </seg>
<seg id="390"> - When you finished wearing the phon, please. - I'm mortified. </seg>
<seg id="391"> God! </seg>
<seg id="392"> Unbelievable! What balls! Unbelievable ... </seg>
<seg id="393"> - That cake was bad. - You're ingested like a pig. </seg>
<seg id="394"> You know my days, I have to send something to some point. </seg>
<seg id="395"> Oh shit! Oddio ... A real nightmare! </seg>
<seg id="396"> - That must be careful, it has exceeded the limit. - She's awful. </seg>
<seg id="397"> - Less! - It's so false. </seg>
<seg id="398"> - He'll give me a lot of annoyance. - They're unbearable. </seg>
<seg id="399"> Why are you always on their side? Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="400"> I'm not on their side! </seg>
<seg id="401"> But what the hell do we do here? </seg>
<seg id="402"> - Is that a joke ?! - Why are you always discussing with her? </seg>
<seg id="403"> We'd be gone if I did not get it all over. </seg>
<seg id="404"> Should I make the "sheep" like her husband? </seg>
<seg id="405"> - You say it was that cake? - It's safe. </seg>
<seg id="406"> A bit of hot Coca-Cola and ... "bang"! </seg>
<seg id="407"> What sucks ... </seg>
<seg id="408"> - Temporeggi, try to be conciliatory. - It's not true. </seg>
<seg id="409"> Yeah, well, you said you were a cape ... and they can do what they want with their son, even if it's a danger. </seg>
<seg id="410"> When a kid is a public danger, it's all about everyone. </seg>
<seg id="411"> It's incredible! That vomited on all my books! </seg>
<seg id="412"> Usually, if one feels he is vomiting, he runs into the bathroom! </seg>
<seg id="413"> Oh ... the Fujita! It's a disgusting thing. </seg>
<seg id="414"> I was about to break through the flush story. </seg>
<seg id="415"> - You were magnificent. - I defended myself well, did not I? </seg>
<seg id="416"> - Magnificent! - "In Queens" ... A genius shot. </seg>
<seg id="417"> - What a shit shit! - What's her name? - "Doodle". - Yeah, it's true! "Doodle" ... - "Doodle"! - Yeah, I call it "Doodle." </seg>
<seg id="418"> Excuse me ... We did not want to offend, really. </seg>
<seg id="419"> It is that the names that couples do give us always laugh. </seg>
<seg id="420"> We, Michael, call us a lot worse, right? </seg>
<seg id="421"> - Here's the phon. - Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="422"> - We call it "Darjeeling". - SÃƒÂ¬. - Like the tÃƒÂ¨. </seg>
<seg id="423"> Yeah ... That's a lot more ridiculous, I think. </seg>
<seg id="424"> - How's your wife? Do you feel better? - Yeah, better. </seg>
<seg id="425"> - I ... I reacted badly and I'm ashamed. - Give me. </seg>
<seg id="426"> I do not know why I did so long for the catalog. </seg>
<seg id="427"> It is that one attaches to these objects without knowing why. </seg>
<seg id="428"> - Pull the cover well. - And you keep the sheet well. - SÃƒÂ¬. - It's good, there are some creases. - The corners are still wet. - Now I fix them. - So you get rid of it. - He's right. - Okay. - It's dry. Just. -Ok. Put the colony on them, I finish this. </seg>
<seg id="429"> - "Doodle" where does it come from? - Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="430"> From "Yankee Doodle" or from cheese? </seg>
<seg id="431"> From a Bulli and Pupe song that makes "Doodle-loodle-loodle" ... </seg>
<seg id="432"> Yeah, I know her! </seg>
<seg id="433"> SÃ ... Ours comes from honeymoon in India. </seg>
<seg id="434"> They called us "Darjeeling" instead of "darling". What stupid thing! </seg>
<seg id="435"> - I'm going to see how it is. -So, go to her, "Darjeeling." - SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="436"> Oh, Nancy, here it is. I began to worry. Do you feel better? </seg>
<seg id="437"> - Yeah, better, I guess. - If you're not sure, stay away from the table. </seg>
<seg id="438"> I put the towel in the tub, I did not know where to put it. </seg>
<seg id="439"> Perfect. </seg>
<seg id="440"> - You've got it! I'm so sorry. - It's all right. </seg>
<seg id="441"> I'm sorry if I did not care about her, I was only taken by the Kokoschka. </seg>
<seg id="442"> - Do not worry. - I ... I was wrong. Please! </seg>
<seg id="443"> First, in the bathroom ... I was thinking ... </seg>
<seg id="444"> SÃƒÂ¬? </seg>
<seg id="445"> Maybe we did not consider one ... </seg>
<seg id="446"> - Well, well ... - What? What's that? </seg>
<seg id="447"> Well ... Apostrophing with insults is a kind of aggression. </seg>
<seg id="448"> - Sure. - It depends! - Of course ... it depends. </seg>
<seg id="449"> Zachary has never been violent, must have had his reasons. </seg>
<seg id="450"> How to be called "spy". Excuse me ... </seg>
<seg id="451"> SÃƒÂ¬, Walter? </seg>
<seg id="452"> There must not be a patient among the present. </seg>
<seg id="453"> Deny, deny! If necessary, we cause the "Journal" cause. </seg>
<seg id="454"> I send you the draft press release by e-mail. I must leave. </seg>
<seg id="455"> If anyone tells me the spy, I react. </seg>
<seg id="456"> Unless it's true. - Thing? </seg>
<seg id="457"> - That's it. </seg>
<seg id="458"> - Do you think my son is a spy? - But no, I was joking! </seg>
<seg id="459"> - Anyway, it's yours too. - How would that be? </seg>
<seg id="460"> - He said it was Zachary. - We forced him. </seg>
<seg id="461"> - We are not on the right track. - Anyway, he did the spy. </seg>
<seg id="462"> - Nancy? - Thing?! Do you think my son ... is it a spy? </seg>
<seg id="463"> - I do not believe anything. - Then do not say anything, do not insinuate. </seg>
<seg id="464"> There is no need to become nervous. </seg>
<seg id="465"> Me and Michael are striving to be impartial and conciliatory. </seg>
<seg id="466"> - Not so much impartial. - Really? </seg>
<seg id="467"> - Apparently impartial. - "Doodle," I have to go. </seg>
<seg id="468"> - And then go away, coward. </seg>
<seg id="469"> - I'm risking losing the most important customer I have. </seg>
<seg id="470"> So this endless shit ... </seg>
<seg id="471"> - My son has lost two incisors! - There's news coming. </seg>
<seg id="472"> - One, irrevocably. - They'll put others, better! </seg>
<seg id="473"> They did not break the timpani. </seg>
<seg id="474"> The error is not the source of the problem. </seg>
<seg id="475"> An 11-year-old boy beat another with a stick! </seg>
<seg id="476"> - Armed with a stick. - We took it off. </seg>
<seg id="477"> - Because we've asked you. We did not oppose it. </seg>
<seg id="478"> It is a term that indicates a clear premeditation and excludes the mistake ... </seg>
<seg id="479"> .. and the infancy of childhood. </seg>
<seg id="480"> - I can not tolerate this tone. - Between us there has never been feeling. </seg>
<seg id="481"> Mr. Cowan ... it's incredibly frustrating ... ..have heard of a mistake already admitted. </seg>
<seg id="482"> The term "armed" was unsuitable and was taken away! Well, in a lazy way, it was soaring. </seg>
<seg id="483"> Zachary reacted to an insult: if they attack me, I'm defending myself ... ... especially if I'm alone against an entire band! </seg>
<seg id="484"> - Since he has been vomited, he is tricked. - Does he realize his vulgarity? </seg>
<seg id="485"> We are all right people, I do not know why we've lost the brackets. </seg>
<seg id="486"> - It's useless. - Michael, just do it! </seg>
<seg id="487"> If we are apparently impartial, it is worth noting that it is not at all. </seg>
<seg id="488"> No, I do not like the china on which the two bastards brought us. </seg>
<seg id="489"> - Let's see Pen not see her like you. - Penelope! - Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="490"> So, Ethan is a sting ?! This is really scandalous. </seg>
<seg id="491"> - Now, I just have to go really. - Yeah, I too. </seg>
<seg id="492"> Go! I surrender. </seg>
<seg id="493"> Ready? </seg>
<seg id="494"> Hello Mom. No, there are friends, but tell me. </seg>
<seg id="495"> Yeah, do whatever the doctor tells you. </seg>
<seg id="496"> SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="497"> The "thing"? </seg>
<seg id="498"> Antril ?! You ... are you taking Antril? A second, mom! </seg>
<seg id="499"> That shit is called Antril? </seg>
<seg id="500"> My mother also takes it. Like thousands of other people. </seg>
<seg id="501"> Mom, you have to stop taking it now. </seg>
<seg id="502"> You now ... you have to do as I say, then I'll explain. </seg>
<seg id="503"> Mom, you have to tell the doctor I told you not to take it. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Good. </seg>
<seg id="505"> Why are you red? Who sees you? </seg>
<seg id="506"> Mom, it's ridiculous! Mum mum! </seg>
<seg id="507"> Mom ... There are people here. </seg>
<seg id="508"> Ok. I love you. Hello. </seg>
<seg id="509"> The crutches are red ... ... so that they do not get hit by trucks in the event of night walks. </seg>
<seg id="510"> They give you Antril for pressure. </seg>
<seg id="511"> If you have no side effects, I quote as a witness. </seg>
<seg id="512"> - Did not I have a scarf? - His indifference is annoying. </seg>
<seg id="513"> If my mother had any symptoms, I would promote a class action. </seg>
<seg id="514"> - There will still be one. - I hope. </seg>
<seg id="515"> It's stupid to be honest, you weaken, you lower your guard. </seg>
<seg id="516"> Come on, Nancy. We have heard enough of sermons for today. </seg>
<seg id="517"> Go, but I want to tell you something: ... ... that I know you, I'm not surprised that ... </seg>
<seg id="518"> What's your name? I'm not surprised that Zacary has behavioral problems. </seg>
<seg id="519"> - When you killed that little hamster ... - Killed ?! </seg>
<seg id="520"> Did I kill the hamster? </seg>
<seg id="521"> Yeah, try to make us feel guilty, do the morality paladins, ... ..when she, on the other hand, is a murderer! </seg>
<seg id="522"> - I did not kill the hamster. - Worse! He abandoned him trembling fear in a hostile environment. - It will be eaten by a dog or a rat! </seg>
<seg id="523"> -This is true. -Thing? - It's horrible what's going to happen to him. I thought he would be happy to go back to the sewers. - No, no! - He abandoned him out! </seg>
<seg id="524"> I can not touch anybody in that family. Pen, you know that! - She's afraid of rodents. - Yeah, I'm afraid of rodents. </seg>
<seg id="525"> And also of snakes and everything that sticks to the ground. - And why did not she go down looking for her? - Because I did not know. </seg>
<seg id="526"> She said this morning, so I went down, I went to the palace ... ... they went to the cellar too! </seg>
<seg id="527"> I find it intolerable to be put on the bench of the defendants ... ... for the history of the hamster involved in the family. </seg>
<seg id="528"> It's just us, it does not have to do with this situation ... ... and I do not admit that I get the assassin in my house. </seg>
<seg id="529"> - What's wrong with your house? - It's my home! I open the door! In fact, the sanctuary to accommodate ... ... as people who should be grateful. </seg>
<seg id="530"> Continue to "caress" the ego ... </seg>
<seg id="531"> - So do not worry! - No! I was disgusted, I'm so glad! </seg>
<seg id="532"> - Michael, it's ridiculous. - Thing? Are you gone mad too? </seg>
<seg id="533"> Does their son stick Ethan and you break the hooks for a hamster? </seg>
<seg id="534"> - What you did to the hamster is wrong. - I do not care a fuck! </seg>
<seg id="535"> You will not regret when your daughter comes back. </seg>
<seg id="536"> I do not get it under a nine-year-old fucker! </seg>
<seg id="537"> Here I agree with him 100%. </seg>
<seg id="538"> - You see it? It's pathetic. - Careful, Penelope ... Careful! </seg>
<seg id="539"> I've been quiet so far, but do not let me cross the limit. </seg>
<seg id="540"> - And Ethan? - What does that have to do with anything? - Is he even here? </seg>
<seg id="541"> - He has more to think about. - He was not fond of Culetto. </seg>
<seg id="542"> "Culetto"! How are you going to give a name like this ?! </seg>
<seg id="543"> Why do not you remarry, do you have to have our son? </seg>
<seg id="544"> All this dialogue and justification of the fuck really stiffened me. </seg>
<seg id="545"> We have been kind, we bought tulips, ... I am dressed as a progressist, ... ... the truth is that I can not afford more than these bullshit goodies. - I'm a fucking son of a bitch! - We're all here. </seg>
<seg id="546"> - No, not all are hysterical bitches. - Not her, it's obvious. </seg>
<seg id="547"> - No, no, thanks to God! - No ... "Darjeeling", not you! </seg>
<seg id="548"> You never lose control! </seg>
<seg id="549"> - Why are you so aggressive with me? - I'm sincere! </seg>
<seg id="550"> - You're aggressive. - You trapped me in this "carnival"! </seg>
<seg id="551"> - Should I trap you? - SÃƒÂ¬! - What a disgusting thing! </seg>
<seg id="552"> You are to preach that you have to be civil, and for me it's okay. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Of course, I'm going to preach it. Someone has to do it! </seg>
<seg id="554"> Do you think it would be better to be a hysterical son of a bitch? </seg>
<seg id="555"> - No one has said it, no one has criticized it. - Oh yeah! </seg>
<seg id="556"> - Do not say so. - Should I cause you cause? </seg>
<seg id="557"> Was it better to destroy you from the insurance company? </seg>
<seg id="558"> - Stop it, Pen. - Thing? - You lost the sense of measure! I do not care! </seg>
<seg id="559"> One does everything to escape the mediocrity ... and instead he ends up humiliated and completely alone. </seg>
<seg id="560"> SÃƒÂ¬, Walter? Get the evidence. They have to take the tests. </seg>
<seg id="561"> In my opinion, given the situation, it is better not to do anything. One is born alone and dies only. Stop! Who wants scotch? </seg>
<seg id="562"> Walter, I'm in the meeting. I'll call you from the office. I live with a totally negative person. </seg>
<seg id="563"> - Who is negative? - I. </seg>
<seg id="564"> - It was stupid to organize this meeting. </seg>
<seg id="565"> - I told you so. - Really? - SÃƒÂ¬. - Did you tell me not to organize it? </seg>
<seg id="566"> - It did not sound like a good idea. - It was, on the other hand. </seg>
<seg id="567"> - No. - Who wants it? - Did you tell me it was not a good idea? </seg>
<seg id="568"> - If I remember ... - "If I remember well"! - Just a little bit. </seg>
<seg id="569"> - You did not have to leave? "Since I'm here, so much to drink. </seg>
<seg id="570"> Michael, look at me and tell us we did not agree to the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="571"> Calm, Penelope, so we do not get to anything. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Who said, "Do not touch the cake, do we care for the Cowans?" </seg>
<seg id="573"> - It was very cute. - What does that have to do with anything? - How would that be? </seg>
<seg id="574"> - Guests are guests. - Tell the truth! It's a liar. </seg>
<seg id="575"> My wife, in fact, had to drag me to bring me here. </seg>
<seg id="576"> When one grows with John Wayne as a model, ... his instinct does not bring him to sort things out with words. </seg>
<seg id="577"> - I thought the model was Ivanhoe. - One is worth the other. - They are complementary. - "They are complementary" ... How much do you want to humble yourself yet? </seg>
<seg id="578"> Moving it here has not served anything. </seg>
<seg id="579"> What did you expect, "Doodle"? What a ridiculous name! </seg>
<seg id="580"> New revelations on maximum systems? This scotch is incredible. </seg>
<seg id="581"> True? 18 years of aging. It comes from a Scottish village where they still use only their barley. </seg>
<seg id="582"> Who took the tulips? </seg>
<seg id="583"> I just said, "Sorry, we did not pick the tulips this week." </seg>
<seg id="584"> I did not ask you to go to dawn till Henry Street! </seg>
<seg id="585"> Do not take it for these things, it's not worth it. </seg>
<seg id="586"> The tulips he wanted him, just him! </seg>
<seg id="587"> And do not we drink anything? Eh? </seg>
<seg id="588"> Penelope and I would like a drink. </seg>
<seg id="589"> It's ... pretty funny, you know? </seg>
<seg id="590"> A fan of John Wayne and lvanhoe who is afraid of a mole! </seg>
<seg id="591"> Enough with this hamster. Stop it. </seg>
<seg id="592"> - He's right, you're funny. - And for her? - I think it's better than no. </seg>
<seg id="593"> - Give me a drink, Michael. - No. - Michael! - No! </seg>
<seg id="594"> What's up, Michael? All right! Drink! So much for me? </seg>
<seg id="595"> - Does alcohol hurt her, by accident? - No, it's the ideal for me! </seg>
<seg id="596"> I do not know... </seg>
<seg id="597"> - Mr. Cowan? - Alan. - Alan ... </seg>
<seg id="598"> You see ... between us two there is no feeling ... ... I live with one who has decided definitively ... ... that life is synonymous with mediocrity. </seg>
<seg id="599"> It is very hard to stay with one who lives enthralled behind this idea ... ... that he does not want to change anything and that he does not get excited at all! </seg>
<seg id="600"> Why do you say to him these things? You know how much he cares! </seg>
<seg id="601"> Everybody needs to believe in a possible ... evolution! </seg>
<seg id="602"> He is the last person to make these speeches. </seg>
<seg id="603"> I say what I want to whom I want. </seg>
<seg id="604"> Who the fuck is right now? </seg>
<seg id="605"> Hello Mom. </seg>
<seg id="606"> Is fine. They broke two teeth, but he's fine. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Yeah, they hurt him, but they'll pass. </seg>
<seg id="608"> I told you there are some people. I'll call you later. Hello. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Are they still hurt? - No. </seg>
<seg id="610"> - So why is it worrying about her mother? - She wants to put anxiety on her. </seg>
<seg id="611"> Penelope, enough! Why do you always do a tragedy for shit? </seg>
<seg id="612"> Penelope, we all care about ourselves. </seg>
<seg id="613"> We would like to believe in a possible evolution ... of which we, abandoned all forms of selfishness, ... may be the true artifacts. Like you, who writes a book on Darfur ... It's a very noble thing! </seg>
<seg id="614"> I understand that one says, "I take a massacre, the story is full, ..." "..and write a book to me". </seg>
<seg id="615"> - Everyone is saved as he can. - But I do not write this book to save me! </seg>
<seg id="616"> - He did not read it, he does not even know what this is all about! - It does not change. </seg>
<seg id="617"> My God ... The odor of Kouros will end up killing me. </seg>
<seg id="618"> - A fucking stench. - She took her hand. - Excuse me. - It's my fault, I splashed like a madman. But why ... can things not be simpler? </seg>
<seg id="619"> Why should it be all that stressful? </seg>
<seg id="620"> She thinks too much ... Women think too much. </seg>
<seg id="621"> - Original as a response. - What does it mean to "think too much"? </seg>
<seg id="622"> How can you continue to live without the slightest moral concept in the world? </seg>
<seg id="623"> - Look, I'm alive! - Michael, shut up! </seg>
<seg id="624"> With your painful complicity, you can get me disgusted. </seg>
<seg id="625"> - Where's your sense of humor? - I do not have it and I do not want it. </seg>
<seg id="626"> In my opinion, the couple is the worst torture God has ever inflicted on us. </seg>
<seg id="627"> - Oh, wonderful! - The couple and the family. </seg>
<seg id="628"> It is not obligatory to tell it to us and it is also uncomfortable! </seg>
<seg id="629"> - It's not a problem. - You agree with me, do you? </seg>
<seg id="630"> Just jump to pole! </seg>
<seg id="631"> - Alan, say something! - He has the right to have his ideas. </seg>
<seg id="632"> - But you do not have to boast it! - SÃƒÂ¬, maybe. </seg>
<seg id="633"> What do we care about their marriage? </seg>
<seg id="634"> We are here for the problem of children, not for their marriage. </seg>
<seg id="635"> - Yeah, huh ... - What? </seg>
<seg id="636"> - They're connected. - Of course they're connected. </seg>
<seg id="637"> - Are Ethan's teeth connected to our wedding? </seg>
<seg id="638"> - SÃƒÂ¬. - I do not follow you. </seg>
<seg id="639"> - Let's go back and look at our situation. </seg>
<seg id="640"> Your children suck your life and leave you old and off, ... ... it's a law of nature! Young men who marry have no idea what's waiting for them! Poor bastards! They are happy, before no one tells him anything. </seg>
<seg id="641"> A friend of my time is about to have a son. </seg>
<seg id="642"> I told him, "A son at our age? Are you a kid?" </seg>
<seg id="643"> "Maybe you'll still have 10 years before you get cancer or a heart attack ..." "and you want to have a son?" </seg>
<seg id="644"> - You do not really think so. - Yes, instead. - I think even worse. </seg>
<seg id="645"> So he's humiliating. </seg>
<seg id="646"> - He says? -That's a cry, Penelope! It only worsens things. </seg>
<seg id="647"> -SÃƒÂ¬. - Oh, but of course ... </seg>
<seg id="648"> - Exceptional, right? - Awesome. - Are you interested in a cigar? </seg>
<seg id="649"> - No cigars in this house! - What a pity. </seg>
<seg id="650"> Did you want to smoke a cigar? </seg>
<seg id="651"> I do what I want and if I get a cigar, I smoke it. </seg>
<seg id="652"> I do not mind not to be sorry for Penelope, which is already quite tense, ... ..wanna be good! </seg>
<seg id="653"> The stopping to whimper, Nancy is right. </seg>
<seg id="654"> See women crying sends men to the beast. </seg>
<seg id="655"> In addition, Michael's thinking, for me, is fully shared. </seg>
<seg id="656"> SÃƒÂ¬? Yes, of course, go. </seg>
<seg id="657"> - Type "New York" and specify the time and day. - Unbearable. </seg>
<seg id="658"> Specifies the time and day on which it is shipped. </seg>
<seg id="659"> Do not "examine", it's too sloppy, better "disapproves". </seg>
<seg id="660"> - It's always like this, day and night. - A second. </seg>
<seg id="661"> - Our life is marked by that cell phone. - It's important. </seg>
<seg id="662"> It's always so: what's happening elsewhere is always more important. </seg>
<seg id="663"> Not "strategy", "maneuver". A maneuver that emerges in two weeks from the shareholders' meeting ... By the way, at the table ... everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="664"> "An inquiry" in quotation marks. Put it in quotation marks. </seg>
<seg id="665"> I do not even protest anymore. Unconditional yield! </seg>
<seg id="666"> - Maybe I'm still vomiting. - Where's the bucket? - I do not know! </seg>
<seg id="667"> Then, quote my words. </seg>
<seg id="668"> - It's close to the bucket, please. - Pen! - What's up? I've set everything up, this time. </seg>
<seg id="669"> "Stabilize my client, as the lawyer of TW Pharma says." At Reuters, in newspapers, in specialized journals. Atutti. </seg>
<seg id="670"> - What do you have? - It's about to vomit. </seg>
<seg id="671"> - Your interest touches me. - I'm worried. </seg>
<seg id="672"> - I did not understand it ... </seg>
<seg id="673"> Come on, Nancy, please, we can not do that ... </seg>
<seg id="674"> Their marriage has now "gone", we do not compete. </seg>
<seg id="675"> Who gives you the right to say that our marriage is "gone"? </seg>
<seg id="676"> SÃƒÂ¬, Walter? Yeah, I've just read it. </seg>
<seg id="677"> You'll see that she's coming to you now. To manipulate the stock price. Look, Walter, I'll call you. - I did not tell him, Steve said. </seg>
<seg id="678"> -Michael! - Michael, excuse me. - I do not let her judge. </seg>
<seg id="679"> - Then you do not judge our son. He beat Ethan. </seg>
<seg id="680"> They're young! When they play, the kids have been kidding, ever since! - It's a rule of life. - It's not true. - Yes, instead. </seg>
<seg id="681"> It takes some maturity to replace the right to violence. </seg>
<seg id="682"> Originally the right, as you will know, was brute force! </seg>
<seg id="683"> - Speaking of prehistory, but not today. - What do we mean today? </seg>
<seg id="684"> She is heavy, like this whole conversation. </seg>
<seg id="685"> Penelope, my belief is the god of the massacre ... ... the god who rules indisputably from the night of the times. </seg>
<seg id="686"> She is interested in Africa, right? </seg>
<seg id="687"> - What happens? - Do not worry. </seg>
<seg id="688"> - Nancy? - I'm fine. - Okay ... </seg>
<seg id="689"> I have just returned from Congo. I've seen eight-year-old children trained to kill ... ... who also kill hundreds of people ... with the machetes, the miter, the kalash ... with the Thumper! </seg>
<seg id="690"> So if my son breaks a pair of teeth to a kid ... with a bamboo cane in public gardens, ... I can not get angry with her. </seg>
<seg id="691"> - You should! - Thumper! - That's what the gangsters call. </seg>
<seg id="692"> - They call it so. How are you? - Very well! </seg>
<seg id="693"> - What did she take? - It is, it's nothing. </seg>
<seg id="694"> You can not speak to Africa, I know the suffering of Africa! </seg>
<seg id="695"> - I do not doubt it. - I do not think of anything else for months. </seg>
<seg id="696"> Avoid touching this subject, please. </seg>
<seg id="697"> - It's getting me nice! - Shut up! </seg>
<seg id="698"> It fights for peace and to maintain the balance of the world. Close that fucking mouth! </seg>
<seg id="699"> - Do you still want to? - More than safe. It can not do me well. </seg>
<seg id="700"> This is New York City, we are not ... Kinshasa! </seg>
<seg id="701"> We live according to the laws of the western society ... ... so what happens at the Brooklyn Bridge Park ... ... it is the values ​​of the West ... ... which, by the way, I'm lucky and I'm proud to belong. </seg>
<seg id="702"> - Puppy your husband must be one of those values. </seg>
<seg id="703"> - Watch out! It's thrown on her like a murderous fury! </seg>
<seg id="704"> My heart would loose. </seg>
<seg id="705"> - He's fucking her! I can not believe it. - What does it matter to him? </seg>
<seg id="706"> No, really, morality forces you to dominate your own impulses, ... ..there are moments when we do not want to do it. </seg>
<seg id="707"> Why should not I say Ave Maria having sex? </seg>
<seg id="708"> - Is this scotch here? - No I do not think so. </seg>
<seg id="709"> "Thumper"! </seg>
<seg id="710"> - "Thumper", it's true! - SÃƒÂ¬. - It's called so. </seg>
<seg id="711"> Why do not you just say "launches"? </seg>
<seg id="712"> It is called so-called "kalash" and not "kalashnikov" or "AK-47". </seg>
<seg id="713"> -Who says that? - Now, Nancy. </seg>
<seg id="714"> It is clear that for a successful man like my husband, ... it is difficult to be concerned with the problems of the mortal ones. </seg>
<seg id="715"> - That's right! - I do not understand... </seg>
<seg id="716"> I do not understand why today, in the global age, ... ... you can not have a bit of sense of participation. </seg>
<seg id="717"> Oh, Penelope, save these boring mummies! </seg>
<seg id="718"> - Now I'm gonna kill him! - SÃƒÂ¬? </seg>
<seg id="719"> - He is right, after a while he can not stand. </seg>
<seg id="720"> "A veiled attempt to ...". Here, so! </seg>
<seg id="721"> Did he have any problems with the rest? Good. </seg>
<seg id="722"> What were we saying? Thumper ... </seg>
<seg id="723"> We were saying that, despite my husband's ideas ... ... things do not concern more than one single country ... ... but I'm concerned with the citizens of the world. "the citizens of the world" ... SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="724"> Nancy, it's absurd to drink in your conditions. </seg>
<seg id="725"> What conditions? I 'm very good. </seg>
<seg id="726"> It's an interesting idea ... Yeah? </seg>
<seg id="727"> No, no interviews before the announcement. </seg>
<seg id="728"> Mr. Cowan, could you end this dreary conversation? </seg>
<seg id="729"> Remember that the shareholders do not give a fuck. Shareholders ... </seg>
<seg id="730"> Nancy, what are you doing? Are you crazy? </seg>
<seg id="731"> Here! - Fuck! - OMG! - So do it! Ah-ha! Here it is. </seg>
<seg id="732"> - It takes the phon! - You're asylum, dear! </seg>
<seg id="733"> I got it all there, inside! It's all right there! I just bought it and I took hours to configure it. </seg>
<seg id="734"> I do not understand ... It was a gesture irresponsible. </seg>
<seg id="735"> All my life ... is there! </seg>
<seg id="736"> You have to remove the sim card and the battery. How do you do it? </seg>
<seg id="737"> - I just bought it ... I do not know! - Let me see. - It's locked. - Look at them as they laugh! Penelope, look at them ... Penelope, stop laughing! </seg>
<seg id="738"> My husband spent the afternoon drying anything. No, this ... - Leave it, it's gone. - You have to wait. - He has gone! </seg>
<seg id="739"> - Do you want to use the phone? - No. Well, I have to say ... </seg>
<seg id="740"> Thing? Thing? What do you have to say, Michael? </seg>
<seg id="741"> No, I have nothing to say. </seg>
<seg id="742"> I say it's a lot better as well. It's so much better, do not you think so? </seg>
<seg id="743"> Men affection to their play, ... ... even if it makes him lose credibility. I was with one ... ... when I saw it with a rectangular purse with the shoulder strap, ... ... a man's handbag but with the shoulder strap ... it's over! </seg>
<seg id="744"> The bag with the shoulder strap is terrible, ... ... having the phone in hand is still worse. </seg>
<seg id="745"> Men should have both hands free, they must have them free! </seg>
<seg id="746"> John Wayne is also my man's idea. </seg>
<seg id="747"> He wore a Colt 45 that made the vacuum around. </seg>
<seg id="748"> A man who does not emit vibrations from the gloomy ... ... it's as if it were devoid of consistency. </seg>
<seg id="749"> So ... Michael, we'll be happy now! </seg>
<seg id="750"> This goodwill, as she said, is going to whores, ... ... I have the feeling that it is almost enjoyable. </seg>
<seg id="751"> That's my opinion. My opinion is that unfortunately some people do not hold alcohol well. </seg>
<seg id="752"> - They're more than lucid. - Of course! </seg>
<seg id="753"> I begin to see things with a pleasant serenity. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Good this: "A pleasant serenity." </seg>
<seg id="755"> I do not understand why you're drunk in front of aliens, "Darjeeling." </seg>
<seg id="756"> - Shut up! - Alan, please, relax. </seg>
<seg id="757"> No cigars in the house! There's Hoyo de Monterrey, Partagas D number 4, ... and there's the Hoyo Coronation! </seg>
<seg id="758"> - Where did you find them? - Better not tell her. - Forward! Hispanic contacts: One of my suppliers is with a hostess ... ..that brings two boxes a week. </seg>
<seg id="759"> You can not smoke at the home of an asthmatic child. Why do you tell your facts? </seg>
<seg id="760"> - Who has asthma? - Our son. - But we had the hamster! </seg>
<seg id="761"> Yes, you should not keep animals when you have asthma. </seg>
<seg id="762"> - No, it's not advisable. - Even red fish are not advised. </seg>
<seg id="763"> I have to fuck all these bullshit! </seg>
<seg id="764"> Maybe I'm the only one to not see things "with a nice serenity"! </seg>
<seg id="765"> The truth is that this is the happiest day of my life. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Are you drunk unhappy! </seg>
<seg id="767"> Michael, every word that comes out of your mouth kills me. </seg>
<seg id="768"> I'm not drunk, I drank a couple of scum of that scotch wretched ... ..will pull you out like the eighth wonder of the world! </seg>
<seg id="769"> I'm not drunk, but believe me ... I'd drown every misery into a good spiral. </seg>
<seg id="770"> My husband is also unhappy. </seg>
<seg id="771"> He got tired of it as if he had been abandoned on the roadside. </seg>
<seg id="772"> (Nancy) I think that even for him is the most unhappy day of his life. </seg>
<seg id="773"> - Lo Ã¨. - I'm sorry, Doodle. </seg>
<seg id="774"> Ready? </seg>
<seg id="775"> Ah ... Ready? </seg>
<seg id="776"> Mom! I told you we have guests! Have you forgotten it? </seg>
<seg id="777"> Because it's a bad drug, it's a poison. </seg>
<seg id="778"> No, Mom, here is a person who can explain it to you. </seg>
<seg id="779"> - Tell her. - Thing? </seg>
<seg id="780"> The one who knows about that fucking poison. </seg>
<seg id="781"> What do you want her to say? He does not know anything! </seg>
<seg id="782"> Good morning how are you lady? </seg>
<seg id="783"> Oh ... Yeah, what symptoms do you have? </seg>
<seg id="784"> Yes, but the operation will solve everything. </seg>
<seg id="785"> Uh, the other leg, huh? </seg>
<seg id="786"> No, I'm not an orthopedist. Now he calls me "doctor"! </seg>
<seg id="787"> "Doctor" ... It's ridiculous! Come on, put it on. </seg>
<seg id="788"> Yeah ... you lose balance, mister? </seg>
<seg id="789"> SÃƒÂ¬ ... No! Of course not! Kill her ... Do not give gossip. </seg>
<seg id="790"> Anyway, it might be a good idea to hang it up for a while ... ... until it's completely cured. </seg>
<seg id="791"> - Yeah, I hear it. It seems to me in great shape. - Come on! Did you understand? Stop taking that medicine. </seg>
<seg id="792"> Do what I tell you. I got it? A kiss. </seg>
<seg id="793"> I can not stand it anymore. They're just breaks of balls. </seg>
<seg id="794"> So let's go back to our problem. </seg>
<seg id="795"> We should decide what to do with Zach tonight. </seg>
<seg id="796"> Or maybe, we think, "Who cares?" We came here for this, no? </seg>
<seg id="797"> Now I'm about to vomit. Where's the bucket? </seg>
<seg id="798"> Stop it now. I just said enough! </seg>
<seg id="799"> They both did wrong. SÃƒÂ¬! That's right, they both made a mistake. </seg>
<seg id="800"> - Are you serious? - How, please? </seg>
<seg id="801"> - Are you serious? - I say seriously, yes! </seg>
<seg id="802"> Ethan, to whom I gave two Codeine at three o'clock at night, was wrong ?! </seg>
<seg id="803"> It is not said that this is not the reality. </seg>
<seg id="804"> Get out of my house right away. Out of the whip! Outside, fuck! </seg>
<seg id="805"> My bag! My bag! Alan! But am I crazy? </seg>
<seg id="806"> - Alan, you have to intervene! - "Alan, you have to intervene"! </seg>
<seg id="807"> Close that mouthpiece! It broke the mirror and the perfume. </seg>
<seg id="808"> Alan, why do not you defend me? </seg>
<seg id="809"> - It's time to go. - In the end I'm not strangulating it! </seg>
<seg id="810"> But what did I do to them? </seg>
<seg id="811"> They did not do both wrong: victims and executioners are not the same! </seg>
<seg id="812"> - A "carnivore"? - Fuck, Penelope, just with these nasty fucks! </seg>
<seg id="813"> - But why do I claim it? - Yeah, you "claim"! </seg>
<seg id="814"> Your cook for those Sudanese Negroes now carry it on everything. </seg>
<seg id="815"> Astounding! What do you have? Why are you acting miserable? </seg>
<seg id="816"> Because I feel it. I want to be miserable! </seg>
<seg id="817"> When you realize that horrors are done in that part of the world, ... you will bitterly regret your obscene nihilism, miserable! </seg>
<seg id="818"> Yeah, "Darjeeling", you're the best in the world, ... ..you are the most beautiful, the best! Yeah, you got it! You understand! </seg>
<seg id="819"> I would say it's time to go. These two are monsters. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - Well, Nancy. - No. No! I want to keep drinking. I want to fall drunk drenched. </seg>
<seg id="821"> That bastard pulled my bag and nobody moved a finger ... </seg>
<seg id="822"> - I want to fall drunk. - That's enough. </seg>
<seg id="823"> And you let her even say our son is an executioner! </seg>
<seg id="824"> We come here to clarify things, instead they insult us, ... they abuse us, they teach us how to be citizens of the world! </seg>
<seg id="825"> I am proud to have a son who has beaten your son ... ... and I clean my ass with his human dick rights! </seg>
<seg id="826"> Wow! With two glasses, here it is ... His true nature comes out! </seg>
<seg id="827"> Where is that sweet and reserved woman finished? </seg>
<seg id="828"> - I told you! - What did he say to him? </seg>
<seg id="829"> That she was false! Only false! I'm sorry. </seg>
<seg id="830"> - And when did you tell him? - While she was drying in the bathroom. </seg>
<seg id="831"> She knew her for a few minutes and she knew she was false? </seg>
<seg id="832"> - It does not take long for me to understand it. - That's it. - I feel it in the skin. </seg>
<seg id="833"> - What do you mean by "false"? - Why do I have to listen to you, Alan? </seg>
<seg id="834"> Relax, Nancy. </seg>
<seg id="835"> It's a fake. It does not matter to you, as well as to her! </seg>
<seg id="836"> - True. - Yeah, it's true. - Well, he said it was true. </seg>
<seg id="837"> It does not matter a fuck. It was so obvious right away! </seg>
<seg id="838"> - And it's the same for her. - But do you care? </seg>
<seg id="839"> - What - Let's talk about it. Tell me what it really matters to him. Do you know that she is more credible when it behaves miserable? </seg>
<seg id="840"> In truth, we all shake it off, maybe Penelope, which, I recognize, is the only coherent one. </seg>
<seg id="841"> I do not want her to be recognized. I do not want it! </seg>
<seg id="842"> But I really want to, really ... </seg>
<seg id="843"> Yeah, "Doodle," we're interested in, but messy. We are not the champions of the civil rights movement. </seg>
<seg id="844"> I saw her friend Jane Fonda on TV the other day. </seg>
<seg id="845"> I almost did not post a Ku Klux Klan poster! </seg>
<seg id="846"> Is my friend Jane Fonda ?! But I care! What does it mean? </seg>
<seg id="847"> You are very similar, you are part of the same kind: ... ... committed to resolving everything. </seg>
<seg id="848"> Those women do not like, ... we prefer sensuality, madness, hormonal storms. </seg>
<seg id="849"> Those who want to show off their intuitive ability ... ... make us want to pass. </seg>
<seg id="850"> - Even to him, to his poor husband, he passes the urge. - Do not talk to me. </seg>
<seg id="851"> She does not care a fuck about what she likes women! </seg>
<seg id="852"> Why do you "vomit" opinions? </seg>
<seg id="853"> If there is one whose opinion does not matter a fuck, it's her! </seg>
<seg id="854"> How to fuck ... Like a negro on a slave ship. </seg>
<seg id="855"> Because, she has not just screamed ... ... that your stunts did well to beat ours? </seg>
<seg id="856"> Yeah, he did fine. Our son is not a small cacasotto. Yours is a fucking spy! </seg>
<seg id="857"> It's time to go, Alan. Why are we still in this house? </seg>
<seg id="858"> Here's what I think of your stupid tulips, your horrendous flowers! </seg>
<seg id="859"> Also for me is the happiest day of my life. </seg>
