<seg id="1"> It will take a bad pneumonia! </seg>
<seg id="2"> Favor your documents. </seg>
<seg id="3"> I have not got them. </seg>
<seg id="4"> They will leave you ... </seg>
<seg id="5"> Just a bad pneumonia. </seg>
<seg id="6"> So it will be colder. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Do I have to wait a long time in this slum? Do I need to muddle? </seg>
<seg id="8"> Quiet. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The commissioner has been warned. </seg>
<seg id="10"> It's on the street. </seg>
<seg id="11"> At least she's dry. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It hurts me as well! </seg>
<seg id="13"> Does it seem to be in an American movie when you read my rights? </seg>
<seg id="14"> If he wants, he can take off his shoes. </seg>
<seg id="15"> I got dressed. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It happens from time to time when it is old. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Is not it true? </seg>
<seg id="18"> I have to call! </seg>
<seg id="19"> I'm sorry, I can not. </seg>
<seg id="20"> How would not it be possible? I have to warn that she'll be late. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Now you can not, do not insist. </seg>
<seg id="22"> I will ask the Commissioner when he arrives. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Otherwise, if I ask the Commissioner! We can swear! I'll tell him how I was dealing with you. Will pass very serious trouble, I'm not a stranger I! </seg>
<seg id="24"> Anyone you know is not special treatments here. </seg>
<seg id="25"> If you put him in the head! </seg>
<seg id="26"> Tell the Commissioner what he wants. </seg>
<seg id="27"> But who will ever be! Can you tell me what time it is or should I wait for Humprey Bogart? </seg>
<seg id="28"> It's 21.15. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Oh shit! ÃƒÆ ... late! </seg>
<seg id="30"> Do you want to stop it with this unbearable litany? - Come on! </seg>
<seg id="31"> And be silent! </seg>
<seg id="32"> Sorry, sorry ... </seg>
<seg id="33"> I'll have an important appointment tomorrow morning. Very. </seg>
<seg id="34"> With the Minister of Culture. </seg>
<seg id="35"> I should prepare myself, I can not miss it. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The commissioner is coming. </seg>
<seg id="37"> - Can I have a cigarette? Find a cigarette. </seg>
<seg id="38"> - Captain, I've never smoked. - Not even! </seg>
<seg id="39"> The Commissioner smokes, I hope. </seg>
<seg id="40"> A commissar always smokes. </seg>
<seg id="41"> A commissioner smokes the pipe, chews a cigar. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Drink this, will do you good. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Come on! </seg>
<seg id="44"> Drink, it's hot. </seg>
<seg id="45"> - ÃƒÂ † latte. - Yeah, it's hot milk. </seg>
<seg id="46"> It's good for you. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Drink. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Drink! </seg>
<seg id="49"> Piece of shit! </seg>
<seg id="50"> But what he does! Marshal! Stop! Stop! </seg>
<seg id="51"> Bad deal. </seg>
<seg id="52"> He did not want it. </seg>
<seg id="53"> With a timing so I would have preferred to stay under the blankets. </seg>
<seg id="54"> You are waking up. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Try to get up. </seg>
<seg id="56"> - Give it a hand. - I'm alone, let me. Let. </seg>
<seg id="57"> I guess she is the commissar. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Excellent supposition. </seg>
<seg id="59"> You have many explanations, Commissioner. </seg>
<seg id="60"> By what authority have his agents practically confiscated me ... ... they have prevented me from communicating with my family ... ... and they have patted me like an animal? </seg>
<seg id="61"> She answers me. </seg>
<seg id="62"> I did three simple questions. </seg>
<seg id="63"> Usually I ask questions here. </seg>
<seg id="64"> I know he's in charge of the accident, but I'm sorry for the controversy. </seg>
<seg id="65"> - I'm usually punctual ... - I miss her punctuality! </seg>
<seg id="66"> I do not feel the desire to make her acquaintance. </seg>
<seg id="67"> I want to know why I'm here. </seg>
<seg id="68"> You will enjoy your curiosity. </seg>
<seg id="69"> Come on. But if you let me know who I'm dealing with ... ... since it goes out in the open countryside in the evening ... ... in the middle of the flood without waterproof and without documents! It does not seem to me a crime or a crime to be without documents. </seg>
<seg id="70"> - They'll leave them in the wallet or on the desk ... - I'm sure. - Or in another jacket. - Of course. </seg>
<seg id="71"> But who do I enjoy talking about? </seg>
<seg id="72"> With a truck driver, a boxer, a dentist, an astrologer ... ... or a magistrate as he knows how to distinguish a crime from a crime? </seg>
<seg id="73"> Once people recognized me before I opened my mouth to say hello ... ... but it's not my habit to make me celebrity shield. Anyway ... ... my name is Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="74"> And my name is Leonardo Da Vinci. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Do not you believe me, Commissioner? </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is her right. </seg>
<seg id="77"> But what maybe it is not his right to stop people ... ... just because he's in the rain. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Do you mind so much rain, Mr. Leonardo Da Vinci? </seg>
<seg id="79"> I'm Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="80"> If you do not believe me, look for my documents. </seg>
<seg id="81"> It's your job, is not it? </seg>
<seg id="82"> I live in the farmhouse, they will be at the studio or on the table in the kitchen ... ... or in my jacket or bed. </seg>
<seg id="83"> "It still happens to me to doubt that I have lived those days ..." "... to have held that friendship ..." "... to have known who had just fallen under my eyes." </seg>
<seg id="84"> "This body was breathing and I wrote these pages." </seg>
<seg id="85"> "In his empty eyes he needed a look ..." "... to his lips a last lament ..." "... to this dream needed a sleeper." </seg>
<seg id="86"> Congratulations, his rhino is very interesting and well-written ... ... but he does not enjoy me at all and I do not understand what that means. </seg>
<seg id="87"> What she calls rhymes is a quotation from a novel ... ... whose author is called Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="88"> You're just unlucky ... ... because when you live in a place where nothing happens ... ... you have a lot of time to read and I read a lot. </seg>
<seg id="89"> Whole days, whole weeks ... Books on books, books on books ... </seg>
<seg id="90"> You can not imagine how many and I happen to read more ... ... the ones I like the most. </seg>
<seg id="91"> "The Palace of the Nine Borders", "Steps," "Hate," "Geometry," "Treatments of Pleasures," "Nero," "The Three Torches" ... all of Onoff's works, my favorite writer ... ... in my humble opinion, the greatest. </seg>
<seg id="92"> I'm just worried that it has fallen badly. </seg>
<seg id="93"> I know Onoff's biography as my slippers. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Walking at night during a thunderstorm is not serious in sÃƒÂ ©. </seg>
<seg id="95"> Forget the identity card in another jacket is just stupid ... ... but trying to escape a lockout ... ... then attacking the agents is even more risky. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Doing all these things together within a few hours ... ... declaring a false identity ... ... it's very dangerous. </seg>
<seg id="97"> Bryan. </seg>
<seg id="98"> - When you want, Commissioner. - We will not have that much. - Who was winning? - It's 45 points ... ... but the guy took the shangai. The shangai is not worth a hand that I never tremble. Prepare me a coffee. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Get up. </seg>
<seg id="100"> What's your name? </seg>
<seg id="101"> Do not throw it for long, its name. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Tell me his name. </seg>
<seg id="103"> Tell me his name, for God! </seg>
<seg id="104"> "I was near the closet ..." "... when Mrs. Doneras's car went into the yard." </seg>
<seg id="105"> "The maid will rush to keep the door open." "The salut." "Then ran before her." </seg>
<seg id="106"> "The lady will slowly step up my bowl." </seg>
<seg id="107"> "She was beautiful." </seg>
<seg id="108"> "From the pocket of the skirt pull out a piece of cooked fish ..." "... and it will begin to eat it." </seg>
<seg id="109"> "She was eating in front of herself without seeing anything." </seg>
<seg id="110"> "When the lady arrives, he shuts away from the closet ..." "... and advances to her but the lady does not look at her." </seg>
<seg id="111"> "He passes by, one centimeter, as it did not exist." </seg>
<seg id="112"> The Lady... </seg>
<seg id="113"> A piece of herring in the skirt pocket. </seg>
<seg id="114"> These are the "Steps" ... ... when Mrs. Doneras wants to leave. </seg>
<seg id="115"> - It's halfway through the book. - Not the "steps". </seg>
<seg id="116"> "The Steps," Commissioner. </seg>
<seg id="117"> "The stairs", third chapter. </seg>
<seg id="118"> The return of Druso. </seg>
<seg id="119"> To declare a false identity is dangerous, Leonardo Da Vinci. </seg>
<seg id="120"> Prince Cosimo's speech before putting majolics down. </seg>
<seg id="121"> "That's why I've been here since ..." "... and that this park is populated with kneeling men ..." "and fallen dancers." </seg>
<seg id="122"> "And so that at the corners of frescoes and walls ..." "... we see crouching figures defecating in the shadows." </seg>
<seg id="123"> Is it right? </seg>
<seg id="124"> She tells me to know my biography in memory. </seg>
<seg id="125"> I'm 48, I wrote essays, novels, songs ... ... articles and plays. </seg>
<seg id="126"> The last one, "Nero", I have directed it badly. </seg>
<seg id="127"> Not more than six years old. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Just enough? </seg>
<seg id="129"> Onoff! </seg>
<seg id="130"> The Great Onoff! </seg>
<seg id="131"> The great Onoff here! How could I not recognize it? </seg>
<seg id="132"> I do not know how to pardon me. Let me shake her hand. </seg>
<seg id="133"> I'm appalled by the unworthy way in which we have welcomed it. </seg>
<seg id="134"> - It is not a case of a tragedy. - But she's all wet. </seg>
<seg id="135"> Soon, dry towels and clothes! And even shoes, quick! </seg>
<seg id="136"> Do you want a cafe? </seg>
<seg id="137"> - Another cafe. </seg>
<seg id="138"> - All right. - May I call, please? - Of course. Only ... we see ... The lines are busy. </seg>
<seg id="139"> But how could I not recognize it? </seg>
<seg id="140"> Yet his face will be seen at least a thousand times. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Photos, television deform everything. </seg>
<seg id="142"> - They hide their faces instead of showing them. - Very true! </seg>
<seg id="143"> What makes a character like you do here? </seg>
<seg id="144"> - I have a cottage in the mountains, near the river. - Women, huh? </seg>
<seg id="145"> - If you like to think it. - Forgive the indiscretion. - I did not want to intrude, excuse me. - Unfortunately I rarely get there. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Only to work in peace, just to concentrate. </seg>
<seg id="147"> Are you writing a new book? </seg>
<seg id="148"> - Tell me I guessed. - More or less guessed. </seg>
<seg id="149"> It's been here for a long time? </seg>
<seg id="150"> I arrived Thursday, today is Sunday ... four days! </seg>
<seg id="151"> The beard! How did I not understand it before? </seg>
<seg id="152"> She always brought her beard! That's why I did not recognize it! </seg>
<seg id="153"> The cafÃ¨, Commissioner. </seg>
<seg id="154"> I brought her shoes. - Can you open please? - Yeah, sure. Arrival. </seg>
<seg id="155"> They are the gardener's boots. </seg>
<seg id="156"> - They will go wide but they are dry. - No matter, thank you. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Forgive me a while ago. How's your hand going? </seg>
<seg id="158"> Do not take it, it will survive. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Thanks for the boots. </seg>
<seg id="160"> Thank you for your indulgence towards my work. </seg>
<seg id="161"> It is I who have to thank her. </seg>
<seg id="162"> I can not imagine how happy she was to meet her ... ... that she could shake her hand that created the worlds ... ... in which I loved living. </seg>
<seg id="163"> I would not abuse her courtesy but if she could accompany me ... </seg>
<seg id="164"> - Of course. - So she'll be able to give you back the uniform and boots. </seg>
<seg id="165"> Master, I'm very embarrassed, I do not know how to tell her. </seg>
<seg id="166"> Documents? They will also have them. </seg>
<seg id="167"> This is not the point. </seg>
<seg id="168"> - What else is there then? - Nothing serious, I assure you. </seg>
<seg id="169"> I would like to stay a little longer. </seg>
<seg id="170"> Okay, if you think it's necessary ... It's nothing serious, just a formality. </seg>
<seg id="171"> - I will not take too long. - I should be grateful, I'm tired. </seg>
<seg id="172"> But she has to call! </seg>
<seg id="173"> Give me the number, let me call you. </seg>
<seg id="174"> ... 3396. Easy to repeat. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Is his house number? </seg>
<seg id="176"> No, my friend answers. </seg>
<seg id="177"> Pass this number on the direct ... ... 93633396. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Could I know what he's dealing with his new book? </seg>
<seg id="179"> You will not want to give me an interview, I hope. </seg>
<seg id="180"> If he knows me well as he says, I will never release it. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Of course, I know, even though I never understood why. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Interviews are always useless. </seg>
<seg id="183"> One comes to you to hear what he knows ... ... for the pleasure of hearing you repeat. Is not it ridiculous? - In a way, yes. </seg>
<seg id="184"> But it is not my case. </seg>
<seg id="185"> I want you to tell me everything he did on the day today ... ... and I assure you I do not know. </seg>
<seg id="186"> AlIora is not an interview, it's just an interrogation. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Call it as you please, but please help me. </seg>
<seg id="188"> It's not easy for me to ask certain things to a man I think. - Then do not ask me. - I have to do it, Mr. Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="189"> I have to do it in her interest. </seg>
<seg id="190"> As you can see we are alone, we will not get verbal drafts. </seg>
<seg id="191"> Tell me exactly how his day went. Eventually, they will accompany you and leave you in peace. </seg>
<seg id="192"> - Do not you have a cigarette? - No one here smokes. </seg>
<seg id="193"> Let it go, it does not do anything. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Smoke a lot? </seg>
<seg id="195"> Three packages a day, last time even more. </seg>
<seg id="196"> - And today? - Today I must have pulverized my record. </seg>
<seg id="197"> - What time did you wake up this morning? - Under 3.30. </seg>
<seg id="198"> - How is it so precise? - I wake up every day at 3:30. I do not sleep a lot. An hour, an hour and a half, never more than two. It will be ten years old that I always wake up at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="199"> - As the protagonist of "Geometry"! - As the protagonist of "Geometry". </seg>
<seg id="200"> - It's a craze! - It's true, I admit it. </seg>
<seg id="201"> I was surprised when he did not recognize my quote ... </seg>
<seg id="202"> ... "His lips needed a last lament." </seg>
<seg id="203"> Do you remember all the names of the people you suspect ... ... who arrested, interrogated, beaten in jail? </seg>
<seg id="204"> Remember their faces, hair color? Did you keep the memory of their words? I do not believe! </seg>
<seg id="205"> You can not remember everything. </seg>
<seg id="206"> The fragment you mentioned earlier ... could be derived from "The Palace of the Ninth Frontier." </seg>
<seg id="207"> But that's right! </seg>
<seg id="208"> It is the beginning of the last chapter. - Great! - We talked about insomnia. </seg>
<seg id="209"> I too suffered insomnia for many years. </seg>
<seg id="210"> I've tried all the medicines, the treatments, and the possible remedies. </seg>
<seg id="211"> Sleepers do not end! </seg>
<seg id="212"> No way. </seg>
<seg id="213"> Then a few years ago, suddenly, I'm completely cured. So, suddenly! </seg>
<seg id="214"> Do not despair, maybe it will happen to her. </seg>
<seg id="215"> I do not need sleeping or nursing. </seg>
<seg id="216"> I was in good health with insomnia. He is my best co-worker. It's just thanks to her that I work when everyone else sleeps. </seg>
<seg id="217"> - She also worked last night. - Less than usual. - Are you sleepy again? - No. </seg>
<seg id="218"> So what did he do? </seg>
<seg id="219"> I looked long at the ceiling and the ceiling looked long at me. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Alone. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Was he alone in bed? </seg>
<seg id="222"> She is an investigator of infinite delicacy. </seg>
<seg id="223"> - Yeah, I was alone. - Just ... continue. </seg>
<seg id="224"> I got up before she roared the cock. </seg>
<seg id="225"> I wore the dressing gown and slipped my slippers. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Then I went to the kitchen. </seg>
<seg id="227"> I caught a coffee in the company of a teaspoon of sugar. </seg>
<seg id="228"> Then I did the shit. </seg>
<seg id="229"> I scratched my head, washed it ... ... I dressed, I phoned ... ... then rewrote what I wrote yesterday ... ... and I took notes on what I'm going to write tomorrow . </seg>
<seg id="230"> So I took a walk. </seg>
<seg id="231"> After I got back home and I put in order the junk. </seg>
<seg id="232"> And then? </seg>
<seg id="233"> And then I went to the station to take my agent. </seg>
<seg id="234"> - How is your agent called? - Daniela. - Daniela come? </seg>
<seg id="235"> Daniela February. </seg>
<seg id="236"> He went to the station to take Daniela February. </seg>
<seg id="237"> - And then? - We had lunch and talked about work. </seg>
<seg id="238"> - In the afternoon I returned to the station. - At what time? </seg>
<seg id="239"> Between 17 and 18. </seg>
<seg id="240"> - She's playing and I'm home. - At what time? </seg>
<seg id="241"> - You will be the 19th. - And then? </seg>
<seg id="242"> - And then ... - And then ...? And then? </seg>
<seg id="243"> I do not remember very well. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Do not you remember very well? </seg>
<seg id="245"> I can not remember anything. </seg>
<seg id="246"> Can not remember? </seg>
<seg id="247"> He just left the station ... ... he's back home, I'm 19 ... </seg>
<seg id="248"> I can not remember more. - I do not remember ... I do not remember. - But it's absurd! </seg>
<seg id="249"> Do not you remember what he did just four hours ago? </seg>
<seg id="250"> - Does this look normal to you? - Is it a crime not to remember? </seg>
<seg id="251"> Do you want to tease me? </seg>
<seg id="252"> - She wants to get around! - He tired me! </seg>
<seg id="253"> What do you want me to do? What importance can it have? </seg>
<seg id="254"> - Why should I get her around? - Re-start, force! </seg>
<seg id="255"> Things change, dear Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="256"> I had the desire to help her. </seg>
<seg id="257"> I admire her and her works ... ... but as long as she does not agree with her memory ... </seg>
<seg id="258"> ... They will not come out of here. - I do not know what to do with his help. What do you suspect in his failed half-caste police headquarters? </seg>
<seg id="259"> Next, the name. </seg>
<seg id="260"> His name. </seg>
<seg id="261"> It's a very simple question, dear Onoff! </seg>
<seg id="262"> - I will not answer before he let me call. - Can not! </seg>
<seg id="263"> If you put it well in your head. </seg>
<seg id="264"> I can not deny the right to call my lawyer. </seg>
<seg id="265"> I will answer your questions only in the presence of my lawyer. </seg>
<seg id="266"> I know perfectly his rights. </seg>
<seg id="267"> But if you do nothing but deny it all! </seg>
<seg id="268"> First his guardian angels "I ask the Commissioner" ... ... then she "give me the number, let me call him on the direct." </seg>
<seg id="269"> Why can not I call from this police station? </seg>
<seg id="270"> The lines are broken, are you doing well so? </seg>
<seg id="271"> Throughout my life as a novelist ... - ... I have never breathed such an exuberance of imagination! - ÃƒÃ † la veritÃƒÂ. </seg>
<seg id="272"> When there is a thunderstorm, the phone lines always jump. Indeed, strange that the light has not gone yet. </seg>
<seg id="273"> - You could tell me before! - I'll give you my word. </seg>
<seg id="274"> When the lines are junctured, you will be the first to call. </seg>
<seg id="275"> - His name. - Why this interrogation? - His name, please! - Why this interrogation? </seg>
<seg id="276"> Tonight not far from his farmhouse was murdered. </seg>
<seg id="277"> Sit down, please. </seg>
<seg id="278"> In my opinion, the assassin has already found. </seg>
<seg id="279"> I do not even think I'm joking that she is a murderer ... ... but if you stubbornly say that she does not remember what she did tonight ... ... she will have to suspect that she is. </seg>
<seg id="280"> - His name! Respond! - My name is Onoff! </seg>
<seg id="281"> - Place and date of birth. - February 3, 1946, Auver-sur. </seg>
<seg id="282"> - Profession? - Writer. - is married? - Twice married. </seg>
<seg id="283"> - That means? - My first wife died shortly after our wedding. </seg>
<seg id="284"> - Under what circumstances? - Cancer. </seg>
<seg id="285"> - When did he get married? - I divorced nine years ago. </seg>
<seg id="286"> - Sons? - Nobody. </seg>
<seg id="287"> - Criminal record? - What do you want to know? How many times have I stolen at the supermarket? Or how many other murders I committed before tonight? </seg>
<seg id="288"> Denying to have criminal records. </seg>
<seg id="289"> - What did he come to do here? - I told you before. </seg>
<seg id="290"> I've reached my mountain cottage to concentrate, to work ... ... far from everyone ... ... far from the world, far from the police commissioners. </seg>
<seg id="291"> - Did she come to work alone? - Just a moment, Commissioner. </seg>
<seg id="292"> - Was she alone in her cottage? - No. </seg>
<seg id="293"> - And who was it with? - With my wife. </seg>
<seg id="294"> Is he married a third time? </seg>
<seg id="295"> I meant ex-wife, indeed with my ex-second wife. </seg>
<seg id="296"> - Have you reconciled? - No, we see you regularly. </seg>
<seg id="297"> Let's say we're good friends. </seg>
<seg id="298"> How many bedrooms are in his cottage? </seg>
<seg id="299"> My ex wife and I are sleeping together if that's what she wants to know. </seg>
<seg id="300"> When you looked at the ceiling at 3:30 it was not just! </seg>
<seg id="301"> - It seems obvious to me. - Why did he first say that he was alone? </seg>
<seg id="302"> I did not say that, check his record. </seg>
<seg id="303"> She said she woke up before she could sing the cock ... ... and she was alone. - I'll be wrong! </seg>
<seg id="304"> So you are always alone. </seg>
<seg id="305"> - How many days has he come to his farmhouse? - Nine days. </seg>
<seg id="306"> - How do you make sure? - If I say 9 days, it's 9 days! </seg>
<seg id="307"> - First he said 4 days. - Did I say 4 days? SÃƒÂ¬. I have not noticed. </seg>
<seg id="308"> I lose the notion of time when I work. You work to lose consciousness. </seg>
<seg id="309"> Dear Mr. Onoff ... ... as long as he is contradicted in his poems, in his novels, that's all right. But if you continue to contradict yourself when there is a murder ... ... it's okay! </seg>
<seg id="310"> Still a little and we all drown. </seg>
<seg id="311"> We do it now, Commissioner. </seg>
<seg id="312"> How do you live in a place like this? </seg>
<seg id="313"> How do we live in a place like this? </seg>
<seg id="314"> We are ready, Commissioner. </seg>
<seg id="315"> Excuse me, please. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Say. </seg>
<seg id="317"> First in the closet I saw wine bottles. </seg>
<seg id="318"> Could I have...? </seg>
<seg id="319"> This wine is very good. </seg>
<seg id="320"> From these parts they say it is miraculous. </seg>
<seg id="321"> - Please, drink. - Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="322"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="323"> - Good, huh? - It's just good. </seg>
<seg id="324"> - Good. - She's still drinking. </seg>
<seg id="325"> Worth as a wish: good birthday, master. Today is February 3rd. </seg>
<seg id="326"> Yeah, it's true. It's my birthday. </seg>
<seg id="327"> - Teacher, can I ask you a question? - Do not you know anything else here? </seg>
<seg id="328"> Before you get angry because I whistled that motive, remember? </seg>
<seg id="329"> I did not have it with her. Believe me, I'm sorry. </seg>
<seg id="330"> Strength, give him a hand. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I know I'm not intoned ... ... but did she recognize it? - Of course I recognized her. </seg>
<seg id="332"> It's a beautiful song. How many times will it be heard around the world! But that song is a piece of my life. </seg>
<seg id="333"> What did I say about light? When it rains... </seg>
<seg id="334"> Teacher, sit here and do not move. </seg>
<seg id="335"> Will they, where are the candles? </seg>
<seg id="336"> I'm from there, look for lÃƒÂ. </seg>
<seg id="337"> - Hurry up. - All right. </seg>
<seg id="338"> Master! Master, do not ... Do you like wine, huh? Where did the glass put it? </seg>
<seg id="339"> Help ... Mum ... Open, AndrÃ ©! Wake up! It's nothing! </seg>
<seg id="340"> - His name. - Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="341"> Place and date of birth. </seg>
<seg id="342"> Auver-sur, on February 3rd, San Biagio's day. </seg>
<seg id="343"> - Which year? - 1946. </seg>
<seg id="344"> - Profession? - Writer. </seg>
<seg id="345"> - Married? - Twice. </seg>
<seg id="346"> - Sons? - Zero. </seg>
<seg id="347"> How many days has he arrived at his mountain cottage? </seg>
<seg id="348"> Four. </seg>
<seg id="349"> Before he had said four, then nine, now four. </seg>
<seg id="350"> Four. </seg>
<seg id="351"> And with whom did he come? </seg>
<seg id="352"> With my ex-second wife. </seg>
<seg id="353"> - What's your second ex-wife's name? - Daniela. </seg>
<seg id="354"> Daniela February. </seg>
<seg id="355"> - Was not she your agent? - it's the same. </seg>
<seg id="356"> - What does it mean? - My ex-second wife is my agent. </seg>
<seg id="357"> - She's back at the station? - SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="358"> - At what time? - Before the dusk. </seg>
<seg id="359"> - Then what did he do? - I stayed home. </seg>
<seg id="360"> Has she stayed home or is she home? </seg>
<seg id="361"> I repeat, I stayed all day at home. </seg>
<seg id="362"> All day. </seg>
<seg id="363"> Can I have wine? </seg>
<seg id="364"> If she stayed all day at home ... ... how could she accompany Daniela February to the station? </seg>
<seg id="365"> I did not accompany her, she went alone. </seg>
<seg id="366"> After she left who came to visit her at home? </seg>
<seg id="367"> Nobody. </seg>
<seg id="368"> - Are you sure? - I remained alone. </seg>
<seg id="369"> I did not come out all night, please believe me. </seg>
<seg id="370"> What did he do after the departure of his agent? What did he do after the departure of his agent? Respond! </seg>
<seg id="371"> I do not remember what I did after that. </seg>
<seg id="372"> - He said he did not go out all day. </seg>
<seg id="373"> - SÃƒÂ¬ ... </seg>
<seg id="374"> How do you know if he says he does not remember what he did next? </seg>
<seg id="375"> What did I do next? </seg>
<seg id="376"> - Are you still at home until you keep a clear memory? - SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="377"> It can therefore be released later. </seg>
<seg id="378"> I do not remember. </seg>
<seg id="379"> She no longer has to remember. </seg>
<seg id="380"> By now he has to confess that he has told me a lot of bales! </seg>
<seg id="381"> First said she came to the farmhouse alone ... ... to have received her agent's visit ... ... and to have her escorted to the station between 17 and 18. </seg>
<seg id="382"> Then he thinks back to us: he has come with his wife ... ... in fact, his former wife, who is also the agent. </seg>
<seg id="383"> But he did not return to the station, he left alone. </seg>
<seg id="384"> Mr. Onoff ... </seg>
<seg id="385"> ... at that station there is only one fucking train ... ... that has never stopped for a single fuckin 'minute ... ... since she came to her cottage ... ... for the simple reason that there has never been a station here. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Never. </seg>
<seg id="387"> She is not worthy of the works she has written. </seg>
<seg id="388"> His novels, his tales, his poems, his songs ... ... are worth more than her. - I hope so. </seg>
<seg id="389"> Tell the truth, confess! He is taking the biggest cantonage of his not brilliant career. </seg>
<seg id="390"> So why did he try to escape like a thief of hens, eh? </seg>
<seg id="391"> Why do not you prove his innocence and do not clear my suspicions? </seg>
<seg id="392"> I tell him why he does not. Because she has committed a murder for tonight. </seg>
<seg id="393"> I do not know if someone was killed and where he was killed. </seg>
<seg id="394"> And if someone was killed, I do not know if she's an old lady ... ... a kid, a goat, a scarecrow! </seg>
<seg id="395"> She does not know anything about it, but we will tell who the victim is. </seg>
<seg id="396"> He accuses me of being a murderer ... ... and pretends to know who the victim is from me! </seg>
<seg id="397"> What kind of policeman is he? A sick man! A fool! </seg>
<seg id="398"> I've never been a great cop and maybe they will never be ... ... but in my not brilliant career I've been involved in so many homicides. </seg>
<seg id="399"> Many have not been able to solve them ... ... for others I've built solutions that have turned out to be wrong. In some cases luck has given me the opportunity ... ... to take the exact reasoning and find some small key ... ... to work in some small lock. </seg>
<seg id="400"> A few times I hit the target because of my only intelligence. </seg>
<seg id="401"> But this is the first time I get caught in a murder ... ... whose only enigma to solve is the assassin's identity. </seg>
<seg id="402"> Unfortunately, I'm not in the condition to do so ... ... because her victim has a horribly disfigured face ... ... and he will not be able to identify before tomorrow. </seg>
<seg id="403"> Do you know what I think? </seg>
<seg id="404"> No. </seg>
<seg id="405"> That she murdered her. </seg>
<seg id="406"> And I'm a good scapegoat arrived at the right time. </seg>
<seg id="407"> - How do you know he's a man? - What a man? She said, "Do you know what I think?" </seg>
<seg id="408"> She wants to tell me things I did not say. </seg>
<seg id="409"> But I know it's a man! </seg>
<seg id="410"> I do not know anything, she's confusing the waters to make me contradict. </seg>
<seg id="411"> You know better than me if he is a man or a woman. </seg>
<seg id="412"> He has no evidence and he will not be a blanket of memory. </seg>
<seg id="413"> An empty memory banal! </seg>
<seg id="414"> Here it is. </seg>
<seg id="415"> "Not to die of anguish or shame ..." "... men are condemned to forget the unpleasant things." </seg>
<seg id="416"> "They are more unpleasant before they begin to forget about it." </seg>
<seg id="417"> It's a phrase, my dear Onoff! </seg>
<seg id="418"> The man who wrote this great truth ... ... must have done something very unpleasant tonight ... ... not to remember what he did a few hours ago. If the writers knew in what mouths they would end their writing ... ... they would cut their hand. </seg>
<seg id="419"> And it would be a pity! </seg>
<seg id="420"> Do you believe in God? After all, he is the top writer. </seg>
<seg id="421"> If he knew how mediocre those works would be, he would have to give up too many things. - It's not hard to believe in God. </seg>
<seg id="422"> It has happened to me hundreds of times ... ... but on many occasions I confess I felt ashamed of Him. </seg>
<seg id="423"> He would have been an excellent writer if he was limited to describing landscapes. </seg>
<seg id="424"> - Excuse me, Commissioner. - I'm confused. </seg>
<seg id="425"> He affirms that God is an author of irrelevant importance. </seg>
<seg id="426"> Because when I quote a book, do I feel so annoyed? </seg>
<seg id="427"> My job is to write, to hear about my books I do not care. </seg>
<seg id="428"> Language does not work much to nothing in this world. </seg>
<seg id="429"> It is used for police interrogations. </seg>
<seg id="430"> Now I understand why it does not publish anything more than six years. </seg>
<seg id="431"> I had thought of another creative crisis. </seg>
<seg id="432"> What does it refer to? </seg>
<seg id="433"> In the three years of silence that preceded the exit of "The Palace of the Nine Borders". </seg>
<seg id="434"> It has not been so long ... ... but I remember the newspapers talking about crises ... ... or the terror of the white page. </seg>
<seg id="435"> Bravo! </seg>
<seg id="436"> She knows me more than I do not remember myself. - Compliments! - We can bet. </seg>
<seg id="437"> Disappointed? </seg>
<seg id="438"> Sincerely, yes. </seg>
<seg id="439"> You should never meet your own myths. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Seeing close by you realize they have boobs. </seg>
<seg id="441"> Risks to discover that the great works that made you dream so much ... ... they thought you were sitting on the pussy ... ... waiting for a drain of diarrhea. </seg>
<seg id="442"> Do you think you have many enemies? - Of course! </seg>
<seg id="443"> One of them came to me today to get my tongues and I killed him. </seg>
<seg id="444"> Have you ever owned firearms? </seg>
<seg id="445"> - No. - Are you sure? </seg>
<seg id="446"> I never owned any kind of weapon. </seg>
<seg id="447"> I can not shoot and I have never fired. </seg>
<seg id="448"> Let the truth tell the corpse that he hid down. How does he say there is a corpse? </seg>
<seg id="449"> I saw him with my eyes as you pulled him out of the van. You can accuse me of abusing someone of his agents ... ... everything else is chatting, he has no evidence against me. </seg>
<seg id="450"> He has no motive to accuse me of murder! </seg>
<seg id="451"> She says she does not know who the victim is. </seg>
<seg id="452"> Tomorrow will have an appointment with the Minister of Culture. </seg>
<seg id="453"> - Let me go, otherwise ... - It's about to commit another crime. </seg>
<seg id="454"> I advise you to be silent. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Sit down. </seg>
<seg id="456"> I will follow his advice to keep silent. </seg>
<seg id="457"> Dear Onoff ... ... maybe I will not be able to prove his guilt. In a sense, I even wish him. </seg>
<seg id="458"> But know she will not go to any appointment with any minister ... ... until he tells me what he did last night after sunset ... ... at the cost of telling me that he was sitting all the time drink ... ... waiting for a diarrhea attack! </seg>
<seg id="459"> Commissioner, do you want me to move my desk? </seg>
<seg id="460"> PerchÃƒÂ ©? It'll be awake. </seg>
<seg id="461"> I have the impression that the night will be long. </seg>
<seg id="462"> Go on. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Has your former second wife resigned? </seg>
<seg id="464"> Do you live with someone? </seg>
<seg id="465"> Do you have a lover? </seg>
<seg id="466"> I will follow his advice to keep silent. As impressive as it may seem ... ... suppose none of you know the place well ... ... and that his former second wife did not go to the station ... ... but rather to look for a any station nearby to leave. </seg>
<seg id="467"> But then how did he think he was going to retrieve the car? </seg>
<seg id="468"> I will follow his advice to keep silent. </seg>
<seg id="469"> Maybe he went looking for the station accompanied by someone else ... ... someone who then came back to his cottage. Who? </seg>
<seg id="470"> I will follow his advice to keep silent. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Or just just does not play. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Perhaps her ex-wife was still holding her company ... ... but in this case where had she been stopped by my agents? </seg>
<seg id="473"> And why did he go so far as to not have more breath to talk? </seg>
<seg id="474"> I will follow his advice to keep silent. </seg>
<seg id="475"> Is 93633396 the number of his former second wife? </seg>
<seg id="476"> I will follow his advice to keep silent. </seg>
<seg id="477"> You specifically asked to call this number ... ... and he insinuated that the victim could be a man to protect himself ... ... to defeat. </seg>
<seg id="478"> Is the victim the 93633396 woman? </seg>
<seg id="479"> And if it's not her ... ... how many want it to be the victims of a lonely successful man ... ... that nobody has seen around for several years? </seg>
<seg id="480"> How many people do you know so well that you can get to him in a place ... ... where you say you go very rarely? </seg>
<seg id="481"> The circle can not be infinite. </seg>
<seg id="482"> A friend? </seg>
<seg id="483"> A lover? </seg>
<seg id="484"> A relative? </seg>
<seg id="485"> The driver? A secretary? </seg>
<seg id="486"> Your doctor? Your lawyer? </seg>
<seg id="487"> One of your collaborators? </seg>
<seg id="488"> A journalist? </seg>
<seg id="489"> A photographer looking for scoop? </seg>
<seg id="490"> A student who breaks her soul with a list of idiotic questions? </seg>
<seg id="491"> His publisher? </seg>
<seg id="492"> Who among these came to visit her yesterday afternoon? </seg>
<seg id="493"> I will follow his advice to keep silent. </seg>
<seg id="494"> She comes from a military family, her father was a war hero ... ... She was an officer ... ... and she wants me to drink that she has never had a gun between the hands? </seg>
<seg id="495"> Will it still follow my advice to keep silent? </seg>
<seg id="496"> Enough! Stop it, Onoff! </seg>
<seg id="497"> Basta cosÃ¬. </seg>
<seg id="498"> Now we change music, Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="499"> You do not mind me. </seg>
<seg id="500"> His biography is known all over the world, I know her by heart. </seg>
<seg id="501"> "He was born into a ditch on the edge of a field." </seg>
<seg id="502"> "With your teeth she cut the cord." "He made a knot and he left." </seg>
<seg id="503"> "They called him Biagio February ..." "... because he was found on a cold February night ..." "... and it was San Biagio's day." </seg>
<seg id="504"> Biagio February I am. </seg>
<seg id="505"> My biography is false. </seg>
<seg id="506"> From beginning to end I wrote it myself. </seg>
<seg id="507"> It was an old man who invented a name suitable for a writer ... ... the name of Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="508"> It was called Foben. My best friend. </seg>
<seg id="509"> It was he who made me great. </seg>
<seg id="510"> I've never been to the army. </seg>
<seg id="511"> I can not shoot. </seg>
<seg id="512"> I grew up ... ... in an orphanage. </seg>
<seg id="513"> They only gave us milk. Every day warm milk, morning and evening. </seg>
<seg id="514"> I hate hot milk. </seg>
<seg id="515"> Paola, do you make me a coffee please? Get me a coffee. </seg>
<seg id="516"> I had a dream ... ... a horrible dream. </seg>
<seg id="517"> I dreamed that I had killed my publisher. I recovered my manuscript and ran, ran, ran to you. </seg>
<seg id="518"> But your house was a police station ... ... and there was a terrible commissioner ... ... who recited my novels by memory. </seg>
<seg id="519"> Paola, get me a sheet before you forget everything. </seg>
<seg id="520"> Paola! </seg>
<seg id="521"> Ah! </seg>
<seg id="522"> I've never seen the commissar so worried. </seg>
<seg id="523"> - It's really in trouble. - It's a terrible situation. You will see that it will end there. </seg>
<seg id="524"> - The marshal says no. - I can not stand the Marshal. </seg>
<seg id="525"> Do as if there was not. Bottom is a good person. </seg>
<seg id="526"> - Everyone's good here. - I still have to get used to it. I need time. </seg>
<seg id="527"> - What time will it be? </seg>
<seg id="528"> She only slept for an hour. </seg>
<seg id="529"> Do you want to warm up a bit? </seg>
<seg id="530"> Could I have paper? I have to take notes. </seg>
<seg id="531"> If it is OK. </seg>
<seg id="532"> Give him some hot wine. </seg>
<seg id="533"> - Do you have an idea for a new book? - You do not write why you have an idea. It is written because you do not know anything else. </seg>
<seg id="534"> Shit! </seg>
<seg id="535"> Shit! </seg>
<seg id="536"> - I'm mortified ... - Keep silent at least. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Be silent. </seg>
<seg id="538"> When I tell him, I will not believe anyone. </seg>
<seg id="539"> How can such a place be absurd? </seg>
<seg id="540"> This is not the ideal place for one as she traveled so much. </seg>
<seg id="541"> Here we are not equipped with anything, we are not in a beautiful city. - Here we have only the woods. - I've been working here for 15 years. </seg>
<seg id="542"> I've always found myself well, I would not go back to the city even dead. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Could I Use Your Typewriter? </seg>
<seg id="544"> Logic would be logical, but it must ask the Commissioner. Ask him. </seg>
<seg id="545"> Can you kill ... ... and then forget it? </seg>
<seg id="546"> Remember, remember it's like a dip at the bottom of the sea. Remember, remember what is to be deleted. And forgetting, and forgetting ... is that you lose things. And forgetting, and forgetting ... will end rare joys. And forgetting, and forgetting ... is that you lose things. </seg>
<seg id="547"> Have you ever seen this man, Mr. February? </seg>
<seg id="548"> I seem to know it. </seg>
<seg id="549"> Who is it? </seg>
<seg id="550"> He was my high school math teacher. </seg>
<seg id="551"> And then? </seg>
<seg id="552"> I need him all my love for numbers, symmetries ... geometric reasoning. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Professor Trivarchi. </seg>
<seg id="554"> Demonstrate the theorems as they tell the fairy tales. </seg>
<seg id="555"> His words did not come to our ears ... ... they reached our brain directly. </seg>
<seg id="556"> I learned from her lessons a genuine enjoyment. </seg>
<seg id="557"> Two parallel lines never meet ... ... however you can imagine the existence of a point ... ... so far in space ... ... but so far in the infinite .. ... that you can believe and admit ... ... that the two faces meet you. </seg>
<seg id="558"> Here it is. </seg>
<seg id="559"> We will call that point "improper point". </seg>
<seg id="560"> Never seen. Are you sure? </seg>
<seg id="561"> - So then? - SÃƒÂ¬ ... </seg>
<seg id="562"> - Yeah, I know her. - Would you say that? </seg>
<seg id="563"> A girl I loved. </seg>
<seg id="564"> When did you last see it? </seg>
<seg id="565"> One morning I left her in the hotel while she slept ... ... and I went to the airport ... ... without even greeting her. </seg>
<seg id="566"> Twenty years ago. </seg>
<seg id="567"> How did you get these photos? </seg>
<seg id="568"> - Try to understand it alone. - I've been looking for you for so long. </seg>
<seg id="569"> Did you look for her even last night? </seg>
<seg id="570"> Yeah, I've been looking for you last night too. </seg>
<seg id="571"> For years I've been freaking everywhere and I do not find them ... ... but not just those two, there were so many. - A mountain of photographs. </seg>
<seg id="572"> - Why are they so important? </seg>
<seg id="573"> They are the testimony of a strange habit ... ... or if they prefer a pity I've had throughout my life. </seg>
<seg id="574"> I took a camera with me and collected the faces I met. A bizarre way to keep a diary! </seg>
<seg id="575"> A game that I abandoned the day I made the decision ... ... to withdraw from public life. </seg>
<seg id="576"> Later, I lost everything. </seg>
<seg id="577"> In those photos there are my friends and my opponents ... ... People I love and love ... ... and those I did not know and did not want to love. </seg>
<seg id="578"> People who held my hand and smiled at me. And those who just looked at me ... ... without saying anything. Thousands, thousands, thousands of faces. </seg>
<seg id="579"> - Where did she get it? - I searched for her cottage. </seg>
<seg id="580"> Evidently he did not look good. </seg>
<seg id="581"> Look look! All these faces ... </seg>
<seg id="582"> Who is it? </seg>
<seg id="583"> ÃƒÃ † Foben. </seg>
<seg id="584"> Foben? </seg>
<seg id="585"> He who invented the name Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="586"> A bitch? </seg>
<seg id="587"> SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="588"> A bitch. </seg>
<seg id="589"> He who met last night? </seg>
<seg id="590"> And how could I have? </seg>
<seg id="591"> In his memory I dedicated "The Palace of the Nine Borders." </seg>
<seg id="592"> Dedicated? </seg>
<seg id="593"> You should know, she has never dedicated a book to anyone. </seg>
<seg id="594"> Everybody knows. </seg>
<seg id="595"> It is impossible. </seg>
<seg id="596"> Impossible? </seg>
<seg id="597"> Do not dirty it, please. </seg>
<seg id="598"> It's not ... it's not possible! </seg>
<seg id="599"> Perhaps he will dedicate to Foben his unpublished book. </seg>
<seg id="600"> No... </seg>
<seg id="601"> It could only be that. </seg>
<seg id="602"> Why this one? </seg>
<seg id="603"> Foben was a vagrant. </seg>
<seg id="604"> He was the most intelligent man I've ever met. </seg>
<seg id="605"> I never got to know her past. </seg>
<seg id="606"> He did not want to talk about it. </seg>
<seg id="607"> I've always believed it was an important personality. </seg>
<seg id="608"> After the success of my first books I offered him to change life ... ... but he never wanted to abandon his den under a bridge. </seg>
<seg id="609"> He was an out of head. </seg>
<seg id="610"> She spent time writing on the back of old calendars or notebooks ... ... or whatever she found in the dustbin. </seg>
<seg id="611"> And he wrote rivers, rivers, and rivers of words. Nonsense words. </seg>
<seg id="612"> One day a letter was delivered to me. I opened it ... ... and I noticed for the first time that he had written something legible ... ... more readable. Each sentence respected the most subtle grammatical rules. </seg>
<seg id="613"> I knew he was dead. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Why does he say he has dedicated a book if he did not? </seg>
<seg id="615"> After a while I went through a very painful period. </seg>
<seg id="616"> I could not write and I could not live. </seg>
<seg id="617"> I spent whole weeks sitting at the desk ... ... without finding anything in me to say. </seg>
<seg id="618"> I often thought of that unreadable stream of words on words ... ... that Foben left me in gift. </seg>
<seg id="619"> - I filled the days by reading that stuff. - What did he hope to find? It was not possible for a moment before death to write a letter ... ... so perfect after spending a lifetime chasing waste ... ... to align meaningless words. </seg>
<seg id="620"> For three years I was only concerned with that monstrous rebus. </seg>
<seg id="621"> The newspapers talked of my silence, impotence, aphasia, misanthropy ... ... but I was able to transform my hunger into an endless excitement. </seg>
<seg id="622"> Thousands of times I dismounted and resumed that indecipherable ocean ... ... after silvia ... ... and finally I discovered the mystery. </seg>
<seg id="623"> It was an incredible simplicity. </seg>
<seg id="624"> Foben did not write. He copied what was perfectly written in his mind. </seg>
<seg id="625"> He conveyed the words simultaneously on 9 notebooks ... ... breaking down the sentences in the same way that the numbers are disintegrating. </seg>
<seg id="626"> It was rare to find two terms that were meaningful next to each other ... ... if not accidentally. </seg>
<seg id="627"> It was extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id="628"> Finally, I could recomposure the story. </seg>
<seg id="629"> I could not even imagine you could write something ... ... so pure ... ... so authentic. </seg>
<seg id="630"> I would have liked to read it. </seg>
<seg id="631"> He did. </seg>
<seg id="632"> Let me print this novel: "The palace of the nine frontiers" ... ... under my signature. </seg>
<seg id="633"> Success was amazing ... ... after so many years of silence. </seg>
<seg id="634"> But I was a finished man and I knew only myself. </seg>
<seg id="635"> Alcohol became my only joy, I needed it every second. </seg>
<seg id="636"> I deeply disdain what I wrote later on. </seg>
<seg id="637"> They will not be able to reach that level. </seg>
<seg id="638"> I'm condemned to write the same thing because when I write ... ... it's like drinking. </seg>
<seg id="639"> My art is nothing but a miserable medicine. </seg>
<seg id="640"> I hate those who want me to publish what I write. </seg>
<seg id="641"> What I'm just writing about not drinking. </seg>
<seg id="642"> Who wants to persuade her to publish again? </seg>
<seg id="643"> My publisher, for example. </seg>
<seg id="644"> - When did you see him last time? - I can not remember it. </seg>
<seg id="645"> Was it yesterday? </seg>
<seg id="646"> - Do you think he killed him? - I came to see him at the farmhouse. </seg>
<seg id="647"> - I do not remember anything. - What did he do afternoon after ... ... after he was looking for photographs in the attic? </seg>
<seg id="648"> I do not know. I kept looking. Did you try this? SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="649"> After what time did he go? </seg>
<seg id="650"> After that I sat and looked. Has it ever been hours and hours to watch from a window? Hours and hours without seeing anything. </seg>
<seg id="651"> And then what did he do? </seg>
<seg id="652"> Paola is back. </seg>
<seg id="653"> Paola? </seg>
<seg id="654"> So far he had said he was in the company of Daniela February. </seg>
<seg id="655"> Only Paola was at the farmhouse. </seg>
<seg id="656"> - Daniela never see her. - Who's Paola? </seg>
<seg id="657"> Who is Paola? </seg>
<seg id="658"> Who is Paola? </seg>
<seg id="659"> ÃƒÂ † everything. </seg>
<seg id="660"> Why did not she want to talk about her before? </seg>
<seg id="661"> Because it is a great discomfort to be loved. </seg>
<seg id="662"> Paola. </seg>
<seg id="663"> So Paola came with her to the farmhouse. </seg>
<seg id="664"> After a few days she left. </seg>
<seg id="665"> Maybe last night. </seg>
<seg id="666"> Then in the afternoon she came back to her, so what? </seg>
<seg id="667"> SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="668"> Why is it coming back so soon? What happened? </seg>
<seg id="669"> I do not want to go back home. </seg>
<seg id="670"> Do you want to bring her home? </seg>
<seg id="671"> Why does Paola want to take her away? </seg>
<seg id="672"> I want to stay alone, go away with them. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Go away with Caesar. </seg>
<seg id="674"> Who is there with Paola? </seg>
<seg id="675"> Friends, unbearable friends. </seg>
<seg id="676"> Caesar. </seg>
<seg id="677"> Who is Caesar? His publisher? </seg>
<seg id="678"> I'll get you tonight, go away. </seg>
<seg id="679"> Why do you want to stay alone? </seg>
<seg id="680"> She cut her hair. </seg>
<seg id="681"> - SÃƒÂ¬. - Why? </seg>
<seg id="682"> Why did she shave her beard? </seg>
<seg id="683"> I want to look at myself. </seg>
<seg id="684"> He wanted to see his face as he did not see for so many years. </seg>
<seg id="685"> And after he did? </seg>
<seg id="686"> I do not find the words. </seg>
<seg id="687"> I do not know what to write. </seg>
<seg id="688"> She tried to write something. </seg>
<seg id="689"> He wrote this. </seg>
<seg id="690"> "I have nothing to say that can be said." </seg>
<seg id="691"> "I would have preferred silence, my most faithful friend ..." "... elegant, infallible, suitable for everything." "But as far as he has been able to live in isolation ..." "... the most complete ..." "... now abstain the absurd desire to thank, sorry ..." "... give an explanation. " "A sign, which I would not know ..." "Forget me often." "Forget ... Onoff!" </seg>
<seg id="692"> It is the only one who has not recognized it. </seg>
<seg id="693"> Foben had done it. </seg>
<seg id="694"> It's been five years in this photo. </seg>
<seg id="695"> I had given her my word, Master. </seg>
<seg id="696"> If you still want to call ... </seg>
<seg id="697"> Ready? Paola, it's me. - It's me, Paola! - Ready? - Can you hear me? - But who is it? - I have to talk to you, tell you many things. - Ready? - Please listen to me! - Ready? - Ready? - It's me, Onoff! I must tell you something very important. - Ready? - Forgive me, Paola! - What I did is terrible ... - I do not feel anything, ready! Ready? Ready? Why do not you hear me, Paola? </seg>
<seg id="698"> Tell the Minister I do not expect more. </seg>
<seg id="699"> Drink, it's good for you. </seg>
<seg id="700"> Drink. </seg>
<seg id="701"> - ÃƒÃ † latte? - SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="702"> Warm milk. It will do you good. </seg>
<seg id="703"> Do not know anything yet? You did not even know that either. Not even them, not even the commissar. Nobody knows when he comes here. </seg>
<seg id="704"> Nice day. </seg>
<seg id="705"> Good sign, dear Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="706"> - There is something I would like to ask. - Please. </seg>
<seg id="707"> Could I take my photographs with me? </seg>
<seg id="708"> In fact we would not have the right to do it because ... ... everything I pick up has to be put in place. </seg>
<seg id="709"> But who will notice the disappearance of his lost photos? </seg>
<seg id="710"> In the study ... ... there was a desk ... - A manuscript? Did he even pick up the manuscript of my last book? </seg>
<seg id="711"> No. </seg>
<seg id="712"> - Sin. - But I've read a few pages ... ... just enough to realize that it's magnificent. Unparalleled. Sublime. </seg>
<seg id="713"> In my opinion his most beautiful book ... ... the best among the things he wrote among those he did not write. </seg>
<seg id="714"> It will be a huge success. </seg>
<seg id="715"> And now a good trip. </seg>
<seg id="716"> Good trip, master. </seg>
<seg id="717"> Thank you very much, Commissioner. </seg>
<seg id="718"> I do not know his name. </seg>
<seg id="719"> Call me Leonardo Da Vinci too. </seg>
<seg id="720"> Thank you, Mr. Leonardo Da Vinci. </seg>
<seg id="721"> She does a good job ... ... difficult but ... </seg>
