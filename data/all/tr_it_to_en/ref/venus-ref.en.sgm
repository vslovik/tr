<seg id="1"> MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND </seg>
<seg id="2"> THUNDER </seg>
<seg id="3"> No, no. This does not exist! </seg>
<seg id="4"> A young sexy guy who knows how to express himself... </seg>
<seg id="5"> ..classical training with a vague talent and just a bit 'of the brain in the head.' </seg>
<seg id="6"> Not one who knows how to pronounce "inextricable"... </seg>
<seg id="7"> .. without having done a course in diction. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Well ', listen... THUNDER </seg>
<seg id="9"> (Marie-Cécile) Why do you say that? Turn to some agent. </seg>
<seg id="10"> These actresses, young and brave. - Yes  I can handle it. </seg>
<seg id="11"> At that time a woman was married at Vanda's age... </seg>
<seg id="12"> .. had five children and had come down with tuberculosis. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Instead today all girls talk like they're ten years old... </seg>
<seg id="14"> .. and have breathed helium: "Too, too cool!" </seg>
<seg id="15"> "It's one thing that rocks!" </seg>
<seg id="16"> I have a parade of more than thirty bitches... </seg>
<seg id="17"> ..Half dressed as bitches and the other half as lesbians. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Vanda or I would be better than most of those girls. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Just put on a dress and a pair of socks you're done. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Hello? Hello, darling? </seg>
<seg id="21"> Oh, damn... Hello? </seg>
<seg id="22"> - Fuck! (Vanda) Knock, knock. </seg>
<seg id="23"> I arrived late, right? Oh shit! </seg>
<seg id="24"> Holy shit! - If you are coming for "Venus in Fur"... </seg>
<seg id="25"> .. everyone left half an hour ago. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I'm sorry, but I was on the other side of Paris. </seg>
<seg id="27"> My phone was charging, I broke a heel... </seg>
<seg id="28"> .. on one of those ventilation grilles that no one knows where they are. </seg>
<seg id="29"> And then there was a guy on the subway who rubbed himself on me... </seg>
<seg id="30"> .. Everything's this way. </seg>
<seg id="31"> And finally, the storm came. I'm soaked to the bone! </seg>
<seg id="32"> Holy cow, it's my day. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Holy shit bitch! </seg>
<seg id="34"> Maybe there's a Valium in the medicine cabinet, want to look? </seg>
<seg id="35"> No, it's just my luck. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Thank you, Lord, for making my life easier. </seg>
<seg id="37"> By the way, let me introduce myself. </seg>
<seg id="38"> - Vanda Jourdain. - Who? Vanda? </seg>
<seg id="39"> Do you understand? </seg>
<seg id="40"> I even have the right name. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Do you know a lot of girls who call themselves "Vanda"? </seg>
<seg id="42"> I was made for that part... </seg>
<seg id="43"> .. and she takes the subway stop in the tunnel with the turn. </seg>
<seg id="44"> - And your name is? - Thomas Novachek. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Pleasure... Hey, wait a minute! </seg>
<seg id="46"> - You are the author. - Yes, well... no. </seg>
<seg id="47"> I did the script. </seg>
<seg id="48"> - Yes, but you are also the director, right? - Yes, I would say yes. </seg>
<seg id="49"> I love your work at least the ones I know. </seg>
<seg id="50"> "Anatomy of a shadow," great! I saw it twice! </seg>
<seg id="51"> Not me. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Oh! But that was stupid. </seg>
<seg id="53"> - I meant that other one. - What other? - What a shame. </seg>
<seg id="54"> However, this one is too radical, at least from what I've read. </seg>
<seg id="55"> And rather risqué, right? Sexy in my opinion. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Or erotic, kind if you like humiliation and stuff like that. </seg>
<seg id="57"> I do not usually go around dressed in leather wearing a dog collar... </seg>
<seg id="58"> .. I'm a reserved type. </seg>
<seg id="59"> But I thought that I would help me get into the part. </seg>
<seg id="60"> - It's S & M stuff? - Not exactly. </seg>
<seg id="61"> - It's set in 1870. - Ah, I see. </seg>
<seg id="62"> - Not much of this in 1870, right? - No, not really. </seg>
<seg id="63"> - Perhaps the sadomasochistic ones dressed like this. - Yeah, I'll go find out. </seg>
<seg id="64"> - I brought a photo and a resume. - Very well, thank you. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Where are they? Here... </seg>
<seg id="66"> - Here's the picture... and the script. - Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="67"> True, it's a bit short but I was made for this part. </seg>
<seg id="68"> I starred in Hedda Gabbler and they said I was fabulous. </seg>
<seg id="69"> - The Theatre of the urinal? - Yes </seg>
<seg id="70"> I have not had the pleasure of following their last season. </seg>
<seg id="71"> You had an appointment for this audition? </seg>
<seg id="72"> At 2 pm or 3... a little 'time ago. </seg>
<seg id="73"> - Vanda... what did you say? - Jourdain? </seg>
<seg id="74"> Everyone always asks me if it's a stage name. </seg>
<seg id="75"> I don't see your name here. </seg>
<seg id="76"> Really? My agent swore that it was all right. </seg>
<seg id="77"> - I'm not on the list? - Please, leave. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Fuck! Well, thanks, sir. </seg>
<seg id="79"> - But since I'm here... - Wait, what does? </seg>
<seg id="80"> I also know the scene! </seg>
<seg id="81"> - No! - Wait! </seg>
<seg id="82"> - I even have a costume. - It's useless. </seg>
<seg id="83"> - You don't want me to audition? - I do not want to do it. No! </seg>
<seg id="84"> - Since I'm here we might try. - They're all gone. </seg>
<seg id="85"> - There is no one to run your lines. - You can do it. </seg>
<seg id="86"> For me it would be an honor to have the author do the scene with me. </seg>
<seg id="87"> - The author. - Fantastic! </seg>
<seg id="88"> - Directly from the author. - Okay, stop! </seg>
<seg id="89"> - To tell the truth, Miss... - Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="90"> - Try something different. - Oh yeah? </seg>
<seg id="91"> - Who do you want? - Someone a bit more... </seg>
<seg id="92"> .. how to say... </seg>
<seg id="93"> Okay, don't try so hard. Someone who is not me. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Too short, too tall, too old, too young... </seg>
<seg id="95"> My resume is too short, okay I understand. </seg>
<seg id="96"> - But no, wait. - I've pissed you off. </seg>
<seg id="97"> - Calm down. - It's not fair. </seg>
<seg id="98"> Really, I've had enough. </seg>
<seg id="99"> My day was a nightmare. </seg>
<seg id="100"> You can arrange other auditions. </seg>
<seg id="101"> I'm here now, I'd avoid having to come back tomorrow. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Even my day was very stressful too. </seg>
<seg id="103"> I auditioned an army of failures. </seg>
<seg id="104"> One even had braces on her teeth. </seg>
<seg id="105"> - Now would not be the time. - Okay. - I need to rest. </seg>
<seg id="106"> - Then I'll have some for dinner. - Yes, I understand. </seg>
<seg id="107"> It will be better to do it when I'm less tired. </seg>
<seg id="108"> Thank you for coming and congratulations on the dress. </seg>
<seg id="109"> - I'll see you soon. - I wish it were so, but it's nice to say it. </seg>
<seg id="110"> You look like a decent person. </seg>
<seg id="111"> This is a shitty job... </seg>
<seg id="112"> .. not to mention the thirty euros for this shitty costume. </seg>
<seg id="113"> - Do not you find this face "1800 something"? - Of course! </seg>
<seg id="114"> - It is very Vanda, right? - Very lovely. </seg>
<seg id="115"> I think wearing a dress this long... </seg>
<seg id="116"> .. because at that time everyone hated asses. </seg>
<seg id="117"> - This is a misstatement. - I see how it is. </seg>
<seg id="118"> CELLPHONE RINGS Please, be nice! </seg>
<seg id="119"> - Yes? - Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="120"> Oh, I must have lost track of the time. </seg>
<seg id="121"> No, no! </seg>
<seg id="122"> I am not speaking to you, someone has just came in. </seg>
<seg id="123"> No, No. I don't know. </seg>
<seg id="124"> Then I'll take the sushi just get takeout. </seg>
<seg id="125"> Hello. </seg>
<seg id="126"> Can you help me close it? </seg>
<seg id="127"> Thomas Novachek in person will give me the lines. </seg>
<seg id="128"> It won't be much help, I'm not an actor. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Come on, you're perfect. You'll crush Kowalski. </seg>
<seg id="130"> - No, Kushemski. - Kushemski. </seg>
<seg id="131"> - You are Kushemski. - OK, all done. </seg>
<seg id="132"> At your service, sir. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Where do we start? You choose. I don't care.. </seg>
<seg id="134"> Let's try the first scene. </seg>
<seg id="135"> Okay. </seg>
<seg id="136"> - It has its fair share? - Yes </seg>
<seg id="137"> - It's a bit the worse for wear. - Is that the full text? </seg>
<seg id="138"> - Who gave it to you? - I don't know. </seg>
<seg id="139"> - I got it from my agent. - And where did he get it? </seg>
<seg id="140"> Is this a problem? Is it top secret? Should not I see it? </seg>
<seg id="141"> It's not important. </seg>
<seg id="142"> - Have you read it? - Yes, in passing, on the subway. </seg>
<seg id="143"> I have seen that is adapted from something. </seg>
<seg id="144"> From a song by Lou Reed "Venus in furs?" </seg>
<seg id="145"> No, it is taken from a novel by an Austrian author </seg>
<seg id="146"> "The Venus in Fur" by Leopold von Sacher Masoch. </seg>
<seg id="147"> I bet you know how to read Austrian and have read it in the original version. </seg>
<seg id="148"> Actually yes. </seg>
<seg id="149"> The book caused a scandal when it was published in 1870. </seg>
<seg id="150"> I believe it! It's a porn BDSM. </seg>
<seg id="151"> - This is not a porn BDSM. - You don't think it's porn? </seg>
<seg id="152"> Not even a little? </seg>
<seg id="153"> Since it was written in the Middle Ages, in 1800 or something? </seg>
<seg id="154"> "Venus in Fur" is a beautiful love story... </seg>
<seg id="155"> It's a masterpiece. It's one of the great texts of world literature. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Ah, yes? For me, it's a porno. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Sadomasochism, I know what it is, I work in the theater. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The term "masochism" comes from Sacher-Masoch and from this book. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Ah! Masochism-Masoch. I get it! </seg>
<seg id="160"> So this guy has given his name to sadomasochism. </seg>
<seg id="161"> - It was not his intention. - I see. </seg>
<seg id="162"> He believed he had written a good novel and they all said it was porn. </seg>
<seg id="163"> - You have plagiarized the book? - No, I adapted it. </seg>
<seg id="164"> I reinvented the dialogue, the situations and... </seg>
<seg id="165"> - There is so much of me in here. - Great! </seg>
<seg id="166"> Genius! Where does it take place? </seg>
<seg id="167"> In a hotel that is located on a remote mountain in the eastern part of... </seg>
<seg id="168"> .. the Imperial Austro-Hungarian Empire. - Let me remember. </seg>
<seg id="169"> - It's complicated. - It's a nice place? </seg>
<seg id="170"> Yes, it is a spa for wealthy people... </seg>
<seg id="171"> .. a luxurious place. </seg>
<seg id="172"> The curtain rises and Kushemski is in his room. </seg>
<seg id="173"> He is reading his book while drinking coffee. </seg>
<seg id="174"> And then... knock knock! Cue Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="175"> It is symbolic from the point of view of the character? </seg>
<seg id="176"> No, but there are still people who read the book. </seg>
<seg id="177"> - Sometimes even the real book, on paper. - Ah, you caught me. </seg>
<seg id="178"> This fellow, what's his name? Sevran, Severan, Savrìne .. </seg>
<seg id="179"> - Severin Von Kushemski. - That's it. </seg>
<seg id="180"> What kind of person is he? </seg>
<seg id="181"> Tell me some adjectives. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Rich, idle, typical of his era, smart traveler, cultured. </seg>
<seg id="183"> - An intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="184"> - So to speak. - Ah, "so to speak." I love it. </seg>
<seg id="185"> - I haven't heard anyone talk like that in a long time. - I wouldn't know. </seg>
<seg id="186"> - So she is a distinct type? - You want me to talk about the character? </seg>
<seg id="187"> Yes, I know it by heart... but yes, please, if you like! </seg>
<seg id="188"> I would say that from many points of view she is a young woman of her time... </seg>
<seg id="189"> .. in spite of the principles she professes, but... </seg>
<seg id="190"> - In spite of what? Of the principles she professes. </seg>
<seg id="191"> At first glance she is a person in place, poised and very cultured. </seg>
<seg id="192"> As you say! Anything else? </seg>
<seg id="193"> Something that I do not already know? </seg>
<seg id="194"> Never mind, I'll manage. </seg>
<seg id="195"> - Will it bother you if I change lighting? - The lighting! </seg>
<seg id="196"> It's a bit' too much, don't you think? </seg>
<seg id="197"> Please, make yourself at home. </seg>
<seg id="198"> Is that better? </seg>
<seg id="199"> Not bad. </seg>
<seg id="200"> Wait. </seg>
<seg id="201"> I don't know how to work that. </seg>
<seg id="202"> OK. That's much better. </seg>
<seg id="203"> I guess this is the sofa. </seg>
<seg id="204"> Yes, it's the sofa. </seg>
<seg id="205"> A desk? </seg>
<seg id="206"> The book that is discussed? </seg>
<seg id="207"> There is a postcard, fantastic! </seg>
<seg id="208"> What is this? </seg>
<seg id="209"> - A phallic symbol? - There are remnants of the previous show. </seg>
<seg id="210"> A Belgian production of... </seg>
<seg id="211"> .. "Stagecoach" adapted to musical comedy. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Where would you like me to stand? </seg>
<seg id="213"> Where do you prefer... </seg>
<seg id="214"> .. less at the center. </seg>
<seg id="215"> Side yard? - Garden. </seg>
<seg id="216"> You want to re-read the text before you start? </seg>
<seg id="217"> No, let's begin. Up to where? </seg>
<seg id="218"> - End of page three. - Okay. And then throw me out, right? </seg>
<seg id="219"> - You want me to to try? - And then throw me out. </seg>
<seg id="220"> - Look, I... Ah, yes! I forgot... </seg>
<seg id="221"> - The phrase that on the first page, The citation.  The epigraph? </seg>
<seg id="222"> Yes, that one. </seg>
<seg id="223"> "The Lord Almighty struck him and put him in the hands of a woman." </seg>
<seg id="224"> Is a quote that appears in the novel, It's taken from the Book of Judith. </seg>
<seg id="225"> It's in the Bible? - In the Apocryphal books of the Bible, yes. </seg>
<seg id="226"> I do not know anything about that. </seg>
<seg id="227"> - Ah, yes. Don't you think it's sexist? </seg>
<seg id="228"> "The Lord Almighty struck him and put him in the hands of a woman." </seg>
<seg id="229"> I just mentioned the novel of Sacher-Masoch. </seg>
<seg id="230"> Yes, but since you put it on page zero... </seg>
<seg id="231"> It does not matter, does not concern me, I'm just an actress. But you... </seg>
<seg id="232"> Forgot the fur! </seg>
<seg id="233"> - She's wearing a stole, right? - Yes, indeed. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Fur, fur... </seg>
<seg id="235"> soft fur... </seg>
<seg id="236"> Maybe not... </seg>
<seg id="237"> This... </seg>
<seg id="238"> Good... </seg>
<seg id="239"> (she begins voice warmups) The socks are dry and the Duchess is arch-dry. </seg>
<seg id="240"> The socks are dry and the Duchess is arch-dry. </seg>
<seg id="241"> Ka ke ke ke. Ka ke ke ke. </seg>
<seg id="242"> - When you're ready. - "The tea has cured your stubborn cough?" </seg>
<seg id="243"> "If you will not leave the role." </seg>
<seg id="244"> (Blows rasberries) </seg>
<seg id="245"> Toc toc. - She enters. </seg>
<seg id="246"> Herr Doktor von Severin Kushemski? </seg>
<seg id="247"> I'm sorry if I'm bothering you. </seg>
<seg id="248"> My name is Vanda von Dunayev. </seg>
<seg id="249"> I am in the room above you. </seg>
<seg id="250"> Last night I found this book, a copy of "Faust"... </seg>
<seg id="251"> .. with your bookmark inside. </seg>
<seg id="252"> I was sitting under the birches, near the statue of Venus. </seg>
<seg id="253"> Thank you very much. </seg>
<seg id="254"> I had just asked the waitress to look for it.. </seg>
<seg id="255"> I found it and there is a postcard inside. </seg>
<seg id="256"> This is a Titian, right? </seg>
<seg id="257"> Yes </seg>
<seg id="258"> "Venus in the mirror," one of my favorite paintings. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Your Venus looks to be well used... </seg>
<seg id="260"> .. just like your book. </seg>
<seg id="261"> She is faithful? </seg>
<seg id="262"> - Excuse me? - Original? </seg>
<seg id="263"> Yes, it is a copy... faithful to the original. </seg>
<seg id="264"> I understand your infatuation, it's a ravishing picture. </seg>
<seg id="265"> Thanks for having troubled to bring it back. </seg>
<seg id="266"> I could not help noticing the strange poem written on the back. </seg>
<seg id="267"> "Venus In Fur". Did you write it? </seg>
<seg id="268"> - Those are poor, poor verses. - Shoddy? really? </seg>
<seg id="269"> "To love and be loved, or as a charm..." </seg>
<seg id="270"> ".. yet, stronger, more beautiful still .." </seg>
<seg id="271"> ".. is this torment that consumes me." </seg>
<seg id="272"> "I will kiss this woman I am a victim..." </seg>
<seg id="273"> ".. the slave miserable..." </seg>
<seg id="274"> ".. submissive, the footrest." </seg>
<seg id="275"> "My goddess, my dictator..." </seg>
<seg id="276"> ".. my Venus in Furs." </seg>
<seg id="277"> The sentiments are interesting. </seg>
<seg id="278"> If I were you, I'd take better care of this. </seg>
<seg id="279"> I appreciate your discretion. </seg>
<seg id="280"> Want to sit for a moment? </seg>
<seg id="281"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="282"> - May I take your coat? - Very kind of you. </seg>
<seg id="283"> This fur is a tartar, right? </seg>
<seg id="284"> A sable of the Caucasus? I would say of Kazakhstan. </seg>
<seg id="285"> Yes, a tartar sable from Kazakhistan, exactly. </seg>
<seg id="286"> Kushemski, standing, observes the fur between his hands. </seg>
<seg id="287"> But you are trembling Kushemski. </seg>
<seg id="288"> Yes, I pray you to forgive me. </seg>
<seg id="289"> - Can I get you something to drink? - Gladly. </seg>
<seg id="290"> - A coffee would be perfect. - Then take mine. </seg>
<seg id="291"> How kind! </seg>
<seg id="292"> - Two lumps, please. - He serves coffee... </seg>
<seg id="293"> I hope the noise above doesn't bother you when I walk in heels. </seg>
<seg id="294"> I'd give anything in the world. </seg>
<seg id="295"> To hear you walk so well in your heels. </seg>
<seg id="296"> So you're a poet, Herr Kuskhemski? </seg>
<seg id="297"> A waste of time. </seg>
<seg id="298"> And a passionate expert on fur? </seg>
<seg id="299"> The love of fur... </seg>
<seg id="300"> - Skip this measure, the following is ... - No, read it. </seg>
<seg id="301"> The love of fur is innate. </seg>
<seg id="302"> a passion given to all by nature. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Put in a little more effort. </seg>
<seg id="304"> The love of fur is innate. </seg>
<seg id="305"> a passion given to all by nature. </seg>
<seg id="306"> Caress a soft and thick fur... </seg>
<seg id="307"> .. hear that particular crackle, that electricity... </seg>
<seg id="308"> I think that it is not only a gift of nature. </seg>
<seg id="309"> Your mother wrapped you up in a sable when you were little? </seg>
<seg id="310"> But that's indiscreet. </seg>
<seg id="311"> I beg your pardon. - No, I... </seg>
<seg id="312"> It was one of my aunts who had a real passion for fur. </seg>
<seg id="313"> - So that explains it. - We are all easily explained. </seg>
<seg id="314"> - But we remain intractable. - Inextricable? </seg>
<seg id="315"> - What do you mean? - Life makes us what we are? </seg>
<seg id="316"> End of page three. </seg>
<seg id="317"> THUNDER </seg>
<seg id="318"> Actually yes... </seg>
<seg id="319"> - That was going very well, Vanda. - I was looking for footholds. </seg>
<seg id="320"> - I did what I could. - Seemed very solid. </seg>
<seg id="321"> That's what it means to be able to create an atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="322"> - I am a professional. - Really, it was... </seg>
<seg id="323"> - Stop it, I'll blush. - I did not say it was perfect. </seg>
<seg id="324"> - No, of course. - Let's go on a little more. </seg>
<seg id="325"> Kushemski - After that he makes his big speech... </seg>
<seg id="326"> .. you go to... </seg>
<seg id="327"> - Read, it helps me to get into character. Please recite. </seg>
<seg id="328"> - You read well, Thomas. - No, it's an impression. </seg>
<seg id="329"> You read really well. </seg>
<seg id="330"> - Have you already thought of someone for Kushemski? - Not really. </seg>
<seg id="331"> - I have several options. - You could do it yourself. </seg>
<seg id="332"> - Yes, of course! - I think so seriously. </seg>
<seg id="333"> - You would be very good. - No, it's quite difficult. </seg>
<seg id="334"> - Does the director inflict this on all the actors? - It is his job. </seg>
<seg id="335"> - I'm directing for the first time. - Doesn't look like it. </seg>
<seg id="336"> I decided to do this because directors never understand anything. </seg>
<seg id="337"> - You have no idea what I have endured... - That's why it's perfect. </seg>
<seg id="338"> - You know what to do. - I have everything in my head. </seg>
<seg id="339"> I want to use the "Lyric Suite" by Alban Berg for the transitions... </seg>
<seg id="340"> - a great idea! - He knows the "Lyric Suite"? </seg>
<seg id="341"> No, but you understand what I mean? </seg>
<seg id="342"> You know the story of the inner life, of the characters, everything! - Yes. </seg>
<seg id="343"> What accent Kushemski should have... </seg>
<seg id="344"> .. or something of the kind. - He's a distinguished man. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Yes, distinguished - And with that, I don't know... </seg>
<seg id="346"> .. an aristocrat. </seg>
<seg id="347"> he moves like this... </seg>
<seg id="348"> Or is that just stupid? </seg>
<seg id="349"> a little. It's silly but it is fantastic. </seg>
<seg id="350"> - For this scene he would wear a dressing gown? - Yes </seg>
<seg id="351"> - You're joking! - Want to try it? </seg>
<seg id="352"> Buck up, I'll help. </seg>
<seg id="353"> But it is magnificent. </seg>
<seg id="354"> - Am I wrong or is it vintage? - So I'm told. </seg>
<seg id="355"> Siegfried Mueller... </seg>
<seg id="356"> .. Vienna... </seg>
<seg id="357"> .. 1869. </seg>
<seg id="358"> I hadn't seen that. </seg>
<seg id="360"> Seems tailor-made for him. </seg>
<seg id="361"> - How does it look? - Very good. </seg>
<seg id="362"> It is close to my size. </seg>
<seg id="363"> - You look great. - Yes </seg>
<seg id="364"> Hello, sweet guy. </seg>
<seg id="365"> And the dog collar? </seg>
<seg id="366"> It is a reminder of the period in which I beat the pavement. </seg>
<seg id="367"> Joke! </seg>
<seg id="368"> Let's pick up a few lines back. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Your mother wrapped you up in a sable when you were a little baby? </seg>
<seg id="370"> That was indiscreet, please forgive me. </seg>
<seg id="371"> It was one of my aunts who had a real passion for fur. </seg>
<seg id="372"> - For him it is tough to say this. - Yes, it's no wonder. </seg>
<seg id="373"> - Then take courage. - Yes </seg>
<seg id="374"> That was indiscreet, please forgive me. </seg>
<seg id="375"> It was one of my aunts who had a real passion for fur. </seg>
<seg id="376"> - So that explains it. - We are all easily explained. </seg>
<seg id="377"> But we remain inexplainable. </seg>
<seg id="378"> Inexplainable? </seg>
<seg id="379"> What do you mean? </seg>
<seg id="380"> Life makes us what we are in an unpredictable moment. </seg>
<seg id="381"> Is the coffee to your liking? </seg>
<seg id="382"> I just tasted it. It's excellent. </seg>
<seg id="383"> This is symbolic, right? The coffee is... </seg>
<seg id="384"> .. and she has just tasted but is already excited. </seg>
<seg id="385"> Ln fact, I was suprised. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Have you ever experienced such a surprising moment Mister Kushemski? </seg>
<seg id="387"> In reality, yes, but I will not bother you. </seg>
<seg id="388"> On the contrary, it fascinates me. </seg>
<seg id="389"> Like one of those English detective novels </seg>
<seg id="390"> He had a mysterious aunt who loved fur. </seg>
<seg id="391"> - We could skip this part. - No, read it. I want to hear it. </seg>
<seg id="392"> He had a mysterious aunt who loved fur. </seg>
<seg id="393"> I was a child from hell... </seg>
<seg id="394"> .. spoiled and cruel. </seg>
<seg id="395"> Mean to our maids and our cat. </seg>
<seg id="396"> I behaved very badly with one of my aunts. </seg>
<seg id="397"> The Countess was a woman majestic, voluptuous and terrible .. </seg>
<seg id="398"> - What is it? - Nothing. </seg>
<seg id="399"> just saying aloud the words that I wrote ... </seg>
<seg id="400"> .. two in the morning on a screen looked different. </seg>
<seg id="401"> You're doing great! </seg>
<seg id="402"> What did your aunt do? </seg>
<seg id="403"> One evening he is avenged. </seg>
<seg id="404"> She came into my room... </seg>
<seg id="405"> .. with her big black Russian fox coat </seg>
<seg id="406"> In her hand she held a rod, a branch of birch... </seg>
<seg id="407"> .. With her were the cook and the maid. </seg>
<seg id="408"> She took off her coat and she rolled up his sleeves... </seg>
<seg id="409"> .. I tried to escape... </seg>
<seg id="410"> .. but the other two women took hold of me,.. </seg>
<seg id="411"> I lowered my pants and she threw me on the fur. </seg>
<seg id="412"> I held still while my aunt punished me with the rod. </seg>
<seg id="413"> My buttocks and my naked thighs were on fire. </seg>
<seg id="414"> The maid encouraged her. </seg>
<seg id="415"> She made fun of me, treated me like a sissy </seg>
<seg id="416"> I danced away but my aunt continued to hit me... </seg>
<seg id="417"> .. until such time as I begged her to stop... </seg>
<seg id="418"> .. out of pity. </seg>
<seg id="419"> When she finally stopped, she forced me to thank her... </seg>
<seg id="420"> .. and kiss her feet. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Then she left room threatening to come back. </seg>
<seg id="422"> And all this in the presence of the maids... </seg>
<seg id="423"> .. and our cat. </seg>
<seg id="424"> From that moment... </seg>
<seg id="425"> .. fur to me more than simple fur... </seg>
<seg id="426"> .. nor a birch branch a simple branch. </seg>
<seg id="427"> In a moment she made me who I am... </seg>
<seg id="428"> - And she came back? - Yes </seg>
<seg id="429"> In my dreams, with her black fur and her rod. </seg>
<seg id="430"> She comes to visit me again, night after night. </seg>
<seg id="431"> - My poor friend. Poor? </seg>
<seg id="432"> She taught me the most valuable thing in the world </seg>
<seg id="433"> - And what did she teach you? - That nothing is more sensual than pain. </seg>
<seg id="434"> That nothing is more exciting than degradation. </seg>
<seg id="435"> The Countess did her job well. </seg>
<seg id="436"> It has become my ideal. </seg>
<seg id="437"> From that day I seek her double. </seg>
<seg id="438"> And when I meet this woman I will marry her. </seg>
<seg id="439"> This step is sensational! </seg>
<seg id="440"> Thanks, it took a lot of work. </seg>
<seg id="441"> In practical terms, it's like a play child abuse? </seg>
<seg id="442"> It has nothing to do with it. </seg>
<seg id="443"> What the fuck does the maltreatment of children have to do with this story? </seg>
<seg id="444"> Holy cow, this craze nowadays... </seg>
<seg id="445"> .. bring everything to a social problem of cock. </seg>
<seg id="446"> - The abuse is not only... - Do not follow stereotypes! </seg>
<seg id="447"> Do not talk about anthropology or sociology! </seg>
<seg id="448"> - Let's make theater. - Yes, but... </seg>
<seg id="449"> Here there is much more at stake than the issue of corporal punishment. </seg>
<seg id="450"> Okay, I'm sorry! </seg>
<seg id="451"> Most of the world live impoverished and dull lives! </seg>
<seg id="452"> Why do we always try to bring everything to something else? </seg>
<seg id="453"> What else will we pull out now? sexism, racism, class struggle? </seg>
<seg id="454"> Well, you're certainly unique, Herr Kushemski. </seg>
<seg id="455"> If I were you, I would be careful. </seg>
<seg id="456"> Your ideal woman could prove more cruel than desired. </seg>
<seg id="457"> I am ready to take the risk. </seg>
<seg id="458"> I know what she is... A supersensual person. </seg>
<seg id="459"> An ascetic of pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="460"> And you, Frau von Vanda Dunayev, who or what are you? </seg>
<seg id="461"> I am a pagan. </seg>
<seg id="462"> Does that mean I'm young, beautiful, rich... </seg>
<seg id="463"> .. and by that account able to derive more benefits than possible to others. </seg>
<seg id="464"> I do not deny anything. </seg>
<seg id="465"> I have the utmost respect for your principles. </seg>
<seg id="466"> I beg your pardon, but I do not care for your respect. </seg>
<seg id="467"> I shall love the man in whom I take delight... </seg>
<seg id="468"> .. and take pleasure from the man who will make me happy... </seg>
<seg id="469"> .. but only until he ceases to make me happy and then I'll find another. </seg>
<seg id="470"> For a man there is no greater cruelty than the infidelity of a woman. </seg>
<seg id="471"> For a woman, it gets worse: forced loyalty. </seg>
<seg id="472"> - I can move? - Yes, yes... go ahead, move. </seg>
<seg id="473"> In our society... </seg>
<seg id="474"> woman can have power except through the intercession of a man. </seg>
<seg id="475"> What will become of the woman, when she becomes equal to men? </seg>
<seg id="476"> When she becomes herself? </seg>
<seg id="477"> The Little Vanda is way ahead of her time! </seg>
<seg id="478"> How do you know all the lines? </seg>
<seg id="479"> - I don't know. I learn quickly. - You know all the text by heart! </seg>
<seg id="480"> You had said that Vanda is very much in place in spite of what? </seg>
<seg id="481"> - Of the principles she professes. - There are those. - Yes </seg>
<seg id="482"> According to her Vanda does not believe in all these stories. </seg>
<seg id="483"> 'what it says... Women's Rights, blah blah blah... </seg>
<seg id="484"> But she does, jerk7, She has character, a mind of her own. </seg>
<seg id="485"> As said: " the principles she professes" and not "her principles." </seg>
<seg id="486"> I think I very much liked the alliteration: "of the principles she professes." </seg>
<seg id="487"> I see! </seg>
<seg id="488"> He sold his soul for alliteration. </seg>
<seg id="489"> 'true, I plead guilty. </seg>
<seg id="490"> Just between us, Thomas, she is a true tomboy. </seg>
<seg id="491"> If you allow, I would say that... </seg>
<seg id="492"> You are better than a pagan. Seems to me you are a goddess. </seg>
<seg id="493"> - Really? And what? - Venus. </seg>
<seg id="494"> And Vanda? Is Venus really me or am I making this up? </seg>
<seg id="495"> Venus took the likeness of a human to come to haunt him? </seg>
<seg id="496"> Not really. </seg>
<seg id="497"> - Or rather, not exactly. - Okay, it's so, and she wanted it. </seg>
<seg id="498"> - She wants it to be ambivalent. - Ambiguous. - Yes, that one. </seg>
<seg id="499"> In fact it is the story of "The Bacchae." </seg>
<seg id="500"> Exactly. What was "The Bacchae"? </seg>
<seg id="501"> - It's an old play, right? - It's a very old play. </seg>
<seg id="502"> "Citizens of Corinth. I stand before you a Testiculus... </seg>
<seg id="503"> .. a poor mortal cursed by the gods for his offenses... </seg>
<seg id="504"> .. and totally fucked up till the end of time." </seg>
<seg id="505"> - It's this kind of play? - Yes </seg>
<seg id="506"> Dionysus descends to Earth and is the arrogant king of Thebes... </seg>
<seg id="507"> A quivering jelly dressed as a woman. - It looks exciting. </seg>
<seg id="508"> After that, the wild women of Thebes The Bacchae, broke him in pieces. </seg>
<seg id="509"> - And Dionysus returns to his home, triumphant. - I think I saw it. </seg>
<seg id="510"> In our case, however, it is not Dionysus but Aphrodite. </seg>
<seg id="511"> Of course. Who is that? </seg>
<seg id="512"> - She is the Greek version of Venus. - But it is the same person. </seg>
<seg id="513"> The same goddess. - Hail Aphrodite! </seg>
<seg id="514"> Hail, oh Aphrodite. Am I unbearably pedantic? </seg>
<seg id="515"> Yes, but I find it cute. </seg>
<seg id="516"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="517"> What do we do? </seg>
<seg id="518"> Seems to me a goddess... </seg>
<seg id="519"> Really? What? </seg>
<seg id="520"> Venus. </seg>
<seg id="521"> But Venus can rule only in a world of slaves. </seg>
<seg id="522"> Then I'd better find one. </seg>
<seg id="523"> Would you like to be my slave, Kushemski Herr Doktor? </seg>
<seg id="524"> I already am. </seg>
<seg id="525"> I became your slave the moment you entered this room. </seg>
<seg id="526"> Really? Are you already in love with me? </seg>
<seg id="527"> Deeply. </seg>
<seg id="528"> I am suffering as if I knew it all along. </seg>
<seg id="529"> - Submit to me. - Stand up straight and turn away from me. </seg>
<seg id="530"> I must confess this intrigues me. </seg>
<seg id="531"> I love your frankness and the clarity of your thought. </seg>
<seg id="532"> From a physical point of view, You have charms, no doubt. </seg>
<seg id="533"> But if a man submits himself to me, I set a trap... </seg>
<seg id="534"> I don't care about traps. Love me! </seg>
<seg id="535"> - You see? He has already begun to give orders. - Marry me! </seg>
<seg id="536"> I am a frivolous woman, Herr Kushemski. </seg>
<seg id="537"> To love me, you will have to give proof of great courage . </seg>
<seg id="538"> - I have already explained my principles. - I do not care. </seg>
<seg id="539"> - I want you to be my wife. - You do not know anything about me. </seg>
<seg id="540"> - I submit to you - That's absurd. </seg>
<seg id="541"> I'll give you complete power over me, for eternity. </seg>
<seg id="542"> Do with me what you wish. </seg>
<seg id="543"> - I submit, hit me if you want. - This is unexpected news to me. </seg>
<seg id="544"> - Let's try it a new way. - What way? </seg>
<seg id="545"> - Put yourself center stage upstage. - No, I'm fine here. </seg>
<seg id="546"> You should move there! </seg>
<seg id="547"> Take the power and stand in a position of power. </seg>
<seg id="548"> OK. Continue. </seg>
<seg id="549"> - This is unexpected news to me. - This isn't working. </seg>
<seg id="550"> Do not move, try it here. </seg>
<seg id="551"> I'll give you complete power over me for eternity, unconditionally. </seg>
<seg id="552"> Do with me what you want. I submit. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Hit me if you want. </seg>
<seg id="554"> - This is unexpected news to me. - You don't even pretend to try? </seg>
<seg id="555"> You wanted me to go here, So I went here. </seg>
<seg id="556"> It's just an audition. </seg>
<seg id="557"> I am listening also to see if you agree. </seg>
<seg id="558"> Do what I say and stay there. </seg>
<seg id="559"> I'll give you complete power over me for eternity, unconditionally. </seg>
<seg id="560"> Do with me what you want. I submit. </seg>
<seg id="561"> - You can hit me if you want. - This unexpected news to me. </seg>
<seg id="562"> - You're right, it's better. - Continue. </seg>
<seg id="563"> What do you want in the depths of your heart? </seg>
<seg id="564"> To belong to you... </seg>
<seg id="565"> .. to disappear in essence sublime... </seg>
<seg id="566"> .. to dress you and undress you... </seg>
<seg id="567"> .. to offer you stockings, to put on your shoes .. . </seg>
<seg id="568"> .. to no longer have my own will. </seg>
<seg id="569"> And that you call that love? - It's the only love there is. </seg>
<seg id="570"> In love, as in politics only one of the parties must have the power. </seg>
<seg id="571"> One must be the hammer and the other the anvil. </seg>
<seg id="572"> I gladly accept to be the anvil. </seg>
<seg id="573"> Enough. </seg>
<seg id="574"> Go on, I like it! </seg>
<seg id="575"> Thomas, you are intelligence, especially with regard to women. </seg>
<seg id="576"> - You really understand women. - Yes, yes... years of study. </seg>
<seg id="577"> - Where was I? - You are an anvil. </seg>
<seg id="578"> Vanda, I try my pain is your pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="579"> You should not ever let the feelings of others dominate. </seg>
<seg id="580"> The servant of his mistress lives to serve her. </seg>
<seg id="581"> I submit, squeeze me like a lemon. </seg>
<seg id="582"> You are incredible. </seg>
<seg id="583"> If you do not want me as a husband, take me as a slave. </seg>
<seg id="584"> Treat me with divine cruelty. </seg>
<seg id="585"> Why should I mistreat those who love me? </seg>
<seg id="586"> - But I'd love it even more. - I do not want to be adored. </seg>
<seg id="587"> All women want to be worshiped, as our Creator. </seg>
<seg id="588"> I am created! I am ruined! I am reduced to a thing! </seg>
<seg id="589"> CELLPHONE RINGS </seg>
<seg id="590"> One moment, please excuse me. </seg>
<seg id="591"> Hello? Yes </seg>
<seg id="592"> No, they are not out yet. </seg>
<seg id="593"> It's all right. </seg>
<seg id="594"> It's all good just... </seg>
<seg id="595"> I don't know. </seg>
<seg id="596"> At times, eh? </seg>
<seg id="597"> I'll call you when I get out? </seg>
<seg id="598"> Yeah, me too, my love. </seg>
<seg id="599"> - Yeah, so... Yes, all right. </seg>
<seg id="600"> Excuse me, huh? </seg>
<seg id="601"> You're not listening. </seg>
<seg id="602"> This time it's a temporary agency, maybe they have something for me? </seg>
<seg id="603"> A typist? Night work in a major law firm. </seg>
<seg id="604"> The contract is for tomorrow. Blah Blah Blah </seg>
<seg id="605"> I don't know! </seg>
<seg id="606"> What will be, will be. </seg>
<seg id="607"> That's life. That's life little one. Bye! </seg>
<seg id="608"> - Crazy! - Your better half? </seg>
<seg id="609"> You think so? - What did you call him? </seg>
<seg id="610"> - I don't know... asshole? - Ah, okay. </seg>
<seg id="611"> - You wonder why I lied to you? - No, it does not concern me. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Why do you say that Vanda? </seg>
<seg id="613"> "I do not deny anything, There are other fish in the sea." </seg>
<seg id="614"> - Why do you talk like that? - You're the hammer, he's the anvil. </seg>
<seg id="615"> What should I say? "Yes, dear, whatever you want"? </seg>
<seg id="616"> This has nothing to do with love, but with my ass. </seg>
<seg id="617"> If I say so, You have to take it. </seg>
<seg id="618"> - This is dialogue from the play. - Oh yeah? </seg>
<seg id="619"> You're making fun of me? </seg>
<seg id="620"> - I do not know, do you think I am? - Will you stop pretending. </seg>
<seg id="621"> For once I cannot tell what you are thinking. </seg>
<seg id="622"> Talking with you is more complicated than doing the tango. </seg>
<seg id="623"> Want to go for a coffee? </seg>
<seg id="624"> Why do you say that? </seg>
<seg id="625"> - You're hitting on me? - Absolutely not! </seg>
<seg id="626"> I'm just offering you a coffee. </seg>
<seg id="627"> - But it's symbolic coffee. - No, no, it's a real coffee. </seg>
<seg id="628"> What would she say if your wife saw you give me a "real coffee"? </seg>
<seg id="629"> - I'm not married. - Ah yes... </seg>
<seg id="630"> I thought so before the phone call. </seg>
<seg id="631"> - It was my fiancee. - It's the same thing. </seg>
<seg id="632"> You would think that? In an interview you said: </seg>
<seg id="633"> "The theater is the best way to get girls into bed." </seg>
<seg id="634"> Don't tell me that you read that stuff. </seg>
<seg id="635"> I was young, it was my first interview. </seg>
<seg id="636"> - You have never been married? - Never. </seg>
<seg id="637"> - You still live with your mother? - I'm weird, but not that weird. </seg>
<seg id="638"> I fox fur her passion? </seg>
<seg id="639"> - No, it's love. - She is really strange. </seg>
<seg id="640"> And I want my woman to be my muse. </seg>
<seg id="641"> So your girlfriend has a pair of wings and everything else? </seg>
<seg id="642"> In the vision of love one must jump completely in. </seg>
<seg id="643"> And she dives right in? - Yes, like a fish... </seg>
<seg id="644"> .. with fireworks, dizziness and thunder. </seg>
<seg id="645"> So, coffee yes? Or no coffee? </seg>
<seg id="646"> I can't conceive of a man giving me his life only by becoming my slave. </seg>
<seg id="647"> I would say that we are not at all compatible Herr Kushemski. </seg>
<seg id="648"> We will cancel each other out. </seg>
<seg id="649"> And I would say that we are made for each other. </seg>
<seg id="650"> Is that not what he feels, Vanda? Is not that what you feel? </seg>
<seg id="651"> I propose we try a contract, as in business. </seg>
<seg id="652"> You will have a year to prove you are the man I need. </seg>
<seg id="653"> - A year is a long time. - I have not finished yet. </seg>
<seg id="654"> - I beg your pardon. - You will be my slave for a year. </seg>
<seg id="655"> So you prepared everything. </seg>
<seg id="656"> You planned everything before entering here. </seg>
<seg id="657"> - Do you believe that? - Stop being naive. </seg>
<seg id="658"> - It's you, you're the author of this. - I'm not sure I had everything ready. </seg>
<seg id="659"> I'm being sincere, I swear. </seg>
<seg id="660"> So you wanted this? You seem ambivalent. </seg>
<seg id="661"> - Ambiguous. - That yes. </seg>
<seg id="662"> Or is it a slut you crave, ready to enjoy everything. </seg>
<seg id="663"> A craving whore? I had never thought of you as that. </seg>
<seg id="664"> It can be even more complicated. </seg>
<seg id="665"> "Be my slave for a year and then I'll let you fuck me." </seg>
<seg id="666"> - She is always ambivalent, right? - Ambiguous. </seg>
<seg id="667"> - Ambiguous. - From my point of view, rather than Kushemski's... </seg>
<seg id="668"> This could be his last chance. Maybe the only one. </seg>
<seg id="669"> And to do what? </seg>
<seg id="670"> - To live. - Ok, good. </seg>
<seg id="671"> He loves the whip and wants to know if she likes it too. </seg>
<seg id="672"> - He told her this? - She understands him. </seg>
<seg id="673"> He is a weirdo and she is an object, like all women of the 1800s. </seg>
<seg id="674"> What? </seg>
<seg id="675"> Who is she, then, Frau Vanda Jourdain? </seg>
<seg id="676"> - I am a pagan. - No, I'm serious. </seg>
<seg id="677"> Try again. </seg>
<seg id="678"> Where did you get this? What is your story? </seg>
<seg id="679"> Daughter of the military, grew up around soldiers, An orphan. </seg>
<seg id="680"> Where have you been? ln which cities and which countries? </seg>
<seg id="681"> I will write a contract stipulating that you will be my slave for a year. </seg>
<seg id="682"> - I'll be at your command. - Done deal. </seg>
<seg id="683"> Let's shake on it. </seg>
<seg id="684"> - There's a real Greek at the hotel. A Greek? - Yes </seg>
<seg id="685"> He's from Athens. </seg>
<seg id="686"> Mounts a stallion as white as snow wearing boots and black leather. </seg>
<seg id="687"> I want you to get me the number of his room. </seg>
<seg id="688"> - But, Vanda... What is it? </seg>
<seg id="689"> - Already reluctant to obey me? - I beg your pardon. </seg>
<seg id="690"> Tomorrow I'll wait in the birch forest, near the statue of Aphrodite. </seg>
<seg id="691"> - At what time? Wait for me until such time as I decide to come. </seg>
<seg id="692"> - Very good. - Don't come without the room number of the Greek. </seg>
<seg id="693"> Now kiss my foot. </seg>
<seg id="694"> And he kneels and kisses her foot. </seg>
<seg id="695"> I love this part, it is very direct. </seg>
<seg id="696"> Pass me my fur now. </seg>
<seg id="697"> S�verin, how will it end? </seg>
<seg id="698"> This depends only on you, Vanda Frau von Dunayev, not on me. </seg>
<seg id="699"> Thanks for the coffee, slave. </seg>
<seg id="700"> OK, I'm leaving right now. A coffee sounds good. </seg>
<seg id="701"> That was intense. The handshake was electric. </seg>
<seg id="702"> The happiness of a time when people were more introverted. </seg>
<seg id="703"> A simple conversation emanated eroticism. </seg>
<seg id="704"> Conversation. The only thing to put between your teeth. </seg>
<seg id="705"> The book begins like this, right? </seg>
<seg id="706"> - The book? - Yes </seg>
<seg id="707"> Where is the beginning scene... </seg>
<seg id="708"> .. when Venus appears to be naked wearing fur in front of the fireplace? </seg>
<seg id="709"> - You've read "The Venus in Furs"? - I looked it over. </seg>
<seg id="710"> When you said you did not know about it you lied. </seg>
<seg id="711"> OK, I lied a little. </seg>
<seg id="712"> - Why didn't you keep that scene? - I did not know how to use it. </seg>
<seg id="713"> Just put it at the beginning, before the guy with Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="714"> You can not think of doing "The Venus in Furs" without Venus. </seg>
<seg id="715"> You can use the same actress for Vanda and Venus. </seg>
<seg id="716"> - Naked on stage? That's no problem. - Yes, I'll think about it. </seg>
<seg id="717"> - Why don't we improvise? It'll give you some ideas. - How? </seg>
<seg id="718"> You have to change the lights. </seg>
<seg id="719"> - Where we are at the beginning of the play? - In Kushemski's room... </seg>
<seg id="720"> .. in the middle of the night. </seg>
<seg id="721"> Ok, middle of the night, two in the morning. </seg>
<seg id="722"> Let's turn them down a little... </seg>
<seg id="723"> Fire in the fireplace, side garden. There! </seg>
<seg id="724"> Yes, very well. </seg>
<seg id="725"> Kushemski What are you doing? </seg>
<seg id="726"> - I do not know... is he in bed? - What a fantasy! </seg>
<seg id="727"> Too obvious? </seg>
<seg id="728"> He is reading when he meets Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="729"> Do not read too early, we are not in the library. </seg>
<seg id="730"> Perhaps he could be writing in his diary. </seg>
<seg id="731"> I like that. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Yes </seg>
<seg id="733"> OK I'm Venus. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Ah shit, who cares? </seg>
<seg id="735"> Face me as if you were naked. - You're hitting on me? </seg>
<seg id="736"> Imagine that I'm your girlfriend and this is unexpected. </seg>
<seg id="737"> - Ah, it's the first time I've done this. - You say that to all the girls. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Yes, but for me it is the truth. </seg>
<seg id="739"> The fire in the fireplace comes to life, we see Venus naked... </seg>
<seg id="740"> .. lasciviously wrapped in a fur coat... - Uh huh </seg>
<seg id="741"> Now wrap me in fur. </seg>
<seg id="742"> You're the director. </seg>
<seg id="743"> I said "lascivious." </seg>
<seg id="744"> Now you go to the desk. </seg>
<seg id="745"> Become the character. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Write in his diary. </seg>
<seg id="747"> - Really write. - I'm doing it. </seg>
<seg id="748"> But out loud, we are in the theater! If not, how do we know who he is? </seg>
<seg id="749"> We are at the beginning of the play. </seg>
<seg id="750"> The scene is illuminated little by little... </seg>
<seg id="751"> We hear the ticking of a grandfather clock. </seg>
<seg id="752"> Tic tac... </seg>
<seg id="753"> .. tick... </seg>
<seg id="754"> .. tick... </seg>
<seg id="755"> ..tic tac! </seg>
<seg id="757"> Two in the morning. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Living in a spa... </seg>
<seg id="759"> .. surrounded by forests and mountains. </seg>
<seg id="760"> It's a moonless night, darkness and silence reign. </seg>
<seg id="761"> (VANDA WHISTLING) A Moment! I hear a sparrow. </seg>
<seg id="762"> - A nightingale. - A nightingale. </seg>
<seg id="763"> VANDA MEOWS </seg>
<seg id="764"> And the cry of a cat in heat. </seg>
<seg id="765"> I feel terribly alone... </seg>
<seg id="766"> .. unhappy, unfulfilled. </seg>
<seg id="767"> (In German) Good evening Sir. </seg>
<seg id="768"> Well, the Germans have invaded again? </seg>
<seg id="769"> I hope I did not disturb you. </seg>
<seg id="770"> Absolutely not. </seg>
<seg id="771"> Hail, Aphrodite. </seg>
<seg id="772"> - So now you have not forgotten me? - Forget? </seg>
<seg id="773"> My most dear old enemy? </seg>
<seg id="774"> - You're too kind. - Yes </seg>
<seg id="775"> I do not have a right to a little kiss? </seg>
<seg id="776"> - That's better, but Thomas... - Oh! - I told Thomas? Oops! </seg>
<seg id="777"> It's so cold in here! </seg>
<seg id="778"> Every time I come to visit you, I am cold. </seg>
<seg id="779"> (SNEEZES) See? </seg>
<seg id="780"> I already catching a cold. </seg>
<seg id="781"> If you dodidn't pass the time walking around naked... </seg>
<seg id="782"> However, I am Venus, I have to be naked. </seg>
<seg id="783"> It is part of the job. </seg>
<seg id="784"> Do not you want to take off those rough clothes and come here and hold me close to you? </seg>
<seg id="785"> There is so much room here under my fur. </seg>
<seg id="786"> No, thank you. </seg>
<seg id="787"> I brought this vision to you, directly from Olympus. </seg>
<seg id="788"> It is divine! </seg>
<seg id="789"> - Do you not see the label? Made in Olympus. </seg>
<seg id="790"> Why should I care about your vision? </seg>
<seg id="791"> I know your small flaw. </seg>
<seg id="792"> You're not interested in women. </seg>
<seg id="793"> You just like their fur, should marry an otter. </seg>
<seg id="794"> I understand it better with an otter than with a woman. </seg>
<seg id="795"> But if I spread legs under my mink... </seg>
<seg id="796"> .. would you refuse a little love? </seg>
<seg id="797"> Is it t 'a little' love you suggest? </seg>
<seg id="798"> No, it is the power that interests you. </seg>
<seg id="799"> - Dare you resist me? - Yes, I dare. </seg>
<seg id="800"> Séférin, I want you on the ground, at my feet. </seg>
<seg id="801"> - Beg me. - Never. </seg>
<seg id="802"> You already belong to me and I will belong until the end of time. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - Never. - (In German) Goodbye my friend. </seg>
<seg id="804"> I'll be back. </seg>
<seg id="805"> And then, poof, she disappears. </seg>
<seg id="806"> Whew! - Not bad, eh? </seg>
<seg id="807"> - Not bad?... - You could write it down and put it in a play. </seg>
<seg id="808"> That's a good idea. </seg>
<seg id="809"> - In this context... - her accent could be like Marlene Dietrich. </seg>
<seg id="810"> Yes, that would work very well. </seg>
<seg id="811"> This gives a different picture of Kushemski. </seg>
<seg id="812"> Yes, in the middle of the night there is a vision of Venus... </seg>
<seg id="813"> .. and then the next morning with Vanda: "I saw her, I beg you." </seg>
<seg id="814"> We conclude by lowering the lights... </seg>
<seg id="815"> .. and then when you get up in the morning again comes knock, knock... </seg>
<seg id="816"> .. and then Venus reappears disguised as Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="817"> - To take revenge. - But yes, it's great! </seg>
<seg id="818"> So are you? - What? </seg>
<seg id="819"> Are you he? </seg>
<seg id="820"> Kushemski - Novacek, Novacek - Kushemski. </seg>
<seg id="821"> - No, not me. You said that there is a lot of you in there. </seg>
<seg id="822"> Then maybe you are Vanda? </seg>
<seg id="823"> - The play has nothing to do with me. - Sure, you're just the author. </seg>
<seg id="824"> Oops, the adapter. </seg>
<seg id="825"> Type: "If a critic says that that's me, kill him." </seg>
<seg id="826"> - I have the right to invent characters. - Of course adapter Novacek. </seg>
<seg id="827"> Just by chance you came across in the characters in a novel about sadomasochism. </seg>
<seg id="828"> No, it's a famous book and I... </seg>
<seg id="829"> Didn't you experience this "unpredictable moment" at the age of twelve? </seg>
<seg id="830"> - No. - ln the library... </seg>
<seg id="831"> - No! - With a cat. </seg>
<seg id="832"> No. </seg>
<seg id="833"> She's still waiting for your "big moment"? </seg>
<seg id="834"> It's not a damn bit like that! </seg>
<seg id="835"> I find the relationship between the two characters both fascinating and complex. Very rich. </seg>
<seg id="836"> - Of course! - I love the emotional depth of the characters. </seg>
<seg id="837"> Don't you see more of this kind of thing nowadays. </seg>
<seg id="838"> Don't you see more of this kind rage nowadays. </seg>
<seg id="839"> - I should submit it some friends of mine. - Okay. </seg>
<seg id="840"> Very well, then I don't understand anything about anything. </seg>
<seg id="841"> When you return home, your fiancee doesn't tie you to the bed and whip you? </seg>
<seg id="842"> No. </seg>
<seg id="843"> You should ask her and see if your fiancee will do it. </seg>
<seg id="844"> - Stop calling her "fiancee." - Excuse me. </seg>
<seg id="845"> Should I call her your better half? </seg>
<seg id="846"> - I don't like that very much. - Would you tell me if you were afraid? </seg>
<seg id="847"> This is not about us. </seg>
<seg id="848"> Let me guess about your... </seg>
<seg id="849"> Marie-Cécile. </seg>
<seg id="850"> Marie-Cécile. I bet she's younger than you. </seg>
<seg id="851"> Good deduction. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Definitely grew up in a nice little house a good family in Provence. </seg>
<seg id="853"> - I bet from La Baule. - Nantes, actually. </seg>
<seg id="854"> But I bet her family spent the weekend in La Baule... </seg>
<seg id="855"> .. in a beautiful villa with a garden. </seg>
<seg id="856"> She goes sailing and loves seafood. </seg>
<seg id="857"> Yes, it's true. </seg>
<seg id="858"> She is tall, slightly authoritarian, but without being disagreeable. </seg>
<seg id="859"> with wonderful hair... </seg>
<seg id="860"> .. Long legs and a nice pair of... </seg>
<seg id="861"> .. eyes. </seg>
<seg id="862"> A mind to be respected. </seg>
<seg id="863"> She went to preparatory school in Paris, of course to Louis Le Grand. </seg>
<seg id="864"> Am I wrong? </seg>
<seg id="865"> Henry IV, School of Economic Sciences - And she has a doctorate? </seg>
<seg id="866"> - She is finishing her thesis in sociology. - She has a dog? </seg>
<seg id="867"> Let's see... I would say a labrador. </seg>
<seg id="868"> It's called... </seg>
<seg id="869"> It has an unusual name that is a little 'intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="870"> - Bourdieu? - Derrida. </seg>
<seg id="871"> You are not lacking in culture I see. </seg>
<seg id="872"> I bet that she's a blonde... </seg>
<seg id="873"> .. she likes a small seedy theater and has a Belgian cactus... </seg>
<seg id="874"> .. Not exactly the Comédie Française. </seg>
<seg id="875"> No, there is taste in her family. Am I right? </seg>
<seg id="876"> Of course, I'm right. Good. </seg>
<seg id="877"> But she is an artist and you lost your head over this Marie-Cécile... </seg>
<seg id="878"> .. and her sensitivity. </seg>
<seg id="879"> "You're perhaps the first man I have ever met... </seg>
<seg id="880"> .. who has a real sensitivity." </seg>
<seg id="881"> She loves books, the opera, the ballet things like that. </seg>
<seg id="882"> In the evening, watch and talk about the Arts last Goncourt... </seg>
<seg id="883"> .. and then fuck quietly. </seg>
<seg id="884"> Nothing is better than a quiet sex session to relax. </seg>
<seg id="885"> But there's a voice that echoes in his head... </seg>
<seg id="886"> .. a voice that demands other things. </seg>
<seg id="887"> I do not know what it is but it echoes. </seg>
<seg id="888"> Boom. </seg>
<seg id="889"> Boom. </seg>
<seg id="890"> Boom. </seg>
<seg id="891"> In the meantime you are happy. </seg>
<seg id="892"> You truly, truly love her... </seg>
<seg id="893"> .. and spend a quiet life looking Arty... </seg>
<seg id="894"> .. and talking about the latest Goncourt. </seg>
<seg id="895"> You will have children who will live just like you and then you will die. </seg>
<seg id="896"> Shall we continue to read? </seg>
<seg id="897"> Yes, let's continue. </seg>
<seg id="898"> The meeting in the birch forest? - Okay. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Let's pretend that's the statue of Venus. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Hail, Aphrodite. </seg>
<seg id="901"> Hail, Aphrodite... </seg>
<seg id="902"> re-read the text quickly? </seg>
<seg id="903"> No, Séνerin. </seg>
<seg id="904"> No, no, this is not good. </seg>
<seg id="905"> All these stories of bondage and domination... </seg>
<seg id="906"> You have corrupted me with all this talk. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I am convinced that she would feel pleasure to dominate a man. </seg>
<seg id="908"> - No. - Maybe even to torture. </seg>
<seg id="909"> - No. - Admit it. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Not for me. </seg>
<seg id="911"> - How can I make you see reason? - To hell with reason! </seg>
<seg id="912"> Séνerin, do you really not understand? </seg>
<seg id="913"> You will never be safe in the hands of a woman... </seg>
<seg id="914"> .. whoever she is. </seg>
<seg id="915"> But this play is sexist. I want to yell! </seg>
<seg id="916"> What is so sexist? </seg>
<seg id="917"> "You will never be safe in the hands of a woman." </seg>
<seg id="918"> - But it's in the book... - you can't change anything? </seg>
<seg id="919"> - The book is sexist. - The book is not sexist. </seg>
<seg id="920"> - On the contrary, it is something... - A classic of world literature. </seg>
<seg id="921"> - That's what you were about to say? - Not exactly. </seg>
<seg id="922"> And this? </seg>
<seg id="923"> We do not have a certain Titian here, sweetheart. </seg>
<seg id="924"> - It's a nice BDSM porno. - What the...? </seg>
<seg id="925"> This story is nothing more than a big cliche. - And why is it a chiche? </seg>
<seg id="926"> He is spanked and suddenly he likes to be whipped? </seg>
<seg id="927"> - It's what happened to the author. - And it happened to you? - No! </seg>
<seg id="928"> Then what? </seg>
<seg id="929"> For me it is a play about two people who are united eternally. </seg>
<seg id="930"> their hearts are handcuffed to each other. </seg>
<seg id="931"> - Shackled in perversion. - No, handcuffed in passion. </seg>
<seg id="932"> - Yes, but it's his passion! - They have a chemistry... </seg>
<seg id="933"> .. it's the meeting of two people lighting fire to the powder. </seg>
<seg id="934"> This is the struggle of the sexes, and classes. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Vanda is an innocent woman who runs into a pervert. </seg>
<seg id="936"> - But then you do not understand anything! - Vanda says: "He has corrupted me!" </seg>
<seg id="937"> And what if if her thirst for domination was asleep inside her? </seg>
<seg id="938"> Kushemski? If he was to awaken it? </seg>
<seg id="939"> And if she was simply a woman? </seg>
<seg id="940"> This text brochure looks like it was written by an old Austrian misogynist. </seg>
<seg id="941"> He forces her to a game of power and then blames her. </seg>
<seg id="942"> - That's not it. - That's exactly it! </seg>
<seg id="943"> - How? - Look at the end for example. - Yes? </seg>
<seg id="944"> Vanda tells the Greek to whip him... </seg>
<seg id="945"> Kushemski .. then leaves him there with his cock in hand... </seg>
<seg id="946"> .. and it would be her fault even though he was the one to want it? </seg>
<seg id="947"> No, I think that little Kushemski has the hots for the Greek. </seg>
<seg id="948"> I wonder how you can be so bitchy at this point. </seg>
<seg id="949"> How can you interpret Vanda so well... </seg>
<seg id="950"> .. and then be bitchy at this point? </seg>
<seg id="951"> Stupid cocksucking actress! </seg>
<seg id="952"> What a cunt! </seg>
<seg id="953"> Shit! </seg>
<seg id="954"> - I'm sorry. - Excuse me? </seg>
<seg id="955"> I'm sorry, I screwed up. </seg>
<seg id="956"> Yes, but what is said is said. </seg>
<seg id="957"> Let's say that the meaning of the play is "beware of your desires." </seg>
<seg id="958"> Since you knock on this door... </seg>
<seg id="959"> here is the argument of the play... .. you do not take the piss out of a goddess: </seg>
<seg id="960"> .. so to speak. </seg>
<seg id="961"> So to speak. </seg>
<seg id="962"> What is the modern way of saying "so to speak"? </seg>
<seg id="963"> "asshole". </seg>
<seg id="964"> If you say so. </seg>
<seg id="965"> Luckily goddesses do not exist otherwise we would be in deep shit. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Okay, you're right. </seg>
<seg id="967"> I accept everything you said. </seg>
<seg id="968"> Can we... can we continue? </seg>
<seg id="969"> Please Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="970"> You do not understand that you will never be safe in the hands of a woman? </seg>
<seg id="971"> Whoever she is. </seg>
<seg id="972"> We are two adventurers, Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="973"> Let's explore the limits of human nature. </seg>
<seg id="974"> You're sick. </seg>
<seg id="975"> You have been poisoned by the countess and now suffer the effects. </seg>
<seg id="976"> - But she adores effects like me. - No... </seg>
<seg id="977"> You like having complete power over me. - No. </seg>
<seg id="978"> Your desires are my orders. </seg>
<seg id="979"> I beg and crawl at your feet. </seg>
<seg id="980"> Do with me whatever you want. </seg>
<seg id="981"> You are a mad visionary, a fanatic. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Who is willing to do anything, to realize his dream. </seg>
<seg id="983"> - But my dream is you. - Get away from me, Séνerin. </seg>
<seg id="984"> Before it is too late. </seg>
<seg id="985"> - Do you love me? - I do not know. </seg>
<seg id="986"> Decide, do something to be convinced. </seg>
<seg id="987"> - How? - Do what all lovers do. </seg>
<seg id="988"> - Let me suffer. - This disgusts me. </seg>
<seg id="989"> And I hate to pretend. </seg>
<seg id="990"> I'm not the countess, your aunt. I am myself. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Repeat the line, the challenge. </seg>
<seg id="992"> I'm not the countess, your aunt. I am myself. </seg>
<seg id="993"> - Again, get angry! - What do you want from me, Thomas? </seg>
<seg id="994"> I'm not your fucking aunt, I am me! What do you want? </seg>
<seg id="995"> - I don't know!! - This time it is no longer the play. </seg>
<seg id="996"> - I want a lot more. - But you're not her. </seg>
<seg id="997"> I'm just a poor bitch who needs the work. </seg>
<seg id="998"> And I'm not your aunt, I am me. Okay so? </seg>
<seg id="999"> Yeah, okay. Very well. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> I can't do this part. It's too hard. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> Don't go, please. Vanda. Stay here. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> Say "I beg you." </seg>
<seg id="1003"> I beg you. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> - You're bad. - I'm completely in your power. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> Liar, you are not in my power, I am in your hands. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> You're supposed to be my slave but it is you who dominates me. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> - It's true isn't it? - What? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> You never stop saying that I have the power but you've got it. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> The more he submits the more he dominates. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> It's complex, yes. </seg>
<seg id="1011"> Here is the contract that we talked about. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> It establishes that you agree to a test of total submission. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> You will be my slave. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> Completely give up your own identity. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> Your body, your soul, your honor will all belong to me. </seg>
<seg id="1016"> Forever. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> Sign at the bottom. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> Well? </seg>
<seg id="1019"> I thought my commitment would be for a year. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> - What? You are trying to dictate conditions to me? - Can I re-read the contract? </seg>
<seg id="1021"> Why? Maybe you don't trust me? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Sign. </seg>
<seg id="1023"> Good. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> From now on you will call me Madame... </seg>
<seg id="1025"> .. and you will speak only when allow it. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> You will serve me meals and await my orders in the hallway. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> In the morning you will dress me and you will dress me in the evening. </seg>
<seg id="1028"> Bring me my socks and put on my shoes. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> - I'll call you Thomas. - But I'm Gregoir in the text. </seg>
<seg id="1030"> I changed it. Henceforth, I will call you Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> You will serve as my valet and bring my coat with my coat of arms. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> And as a gentleman... - You have to keep your word. </seg>
<seg id="1033"> Don't we have a signed a contract which states that you are my slave? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> - But I'm not your slave, I'm your valet. - The difference escapes me. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> - Is it a game? - This is what I am. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> I'm Stubborn, strong-willed, greedy... </seg>
<seg id="1037"> .. and when I start something, I see it through to the end. </seg>
<seg id="1038"> The more you resist, the more I persist. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> But, deep down, your nature is noble. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> What do you know about my nature aside from what you think you know? </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Please forgive me, I was despicable. </seg>
<seg id="1042"> Give me your passport and your money. </seg>

<seg id="1054"> Yes, you are deliciously evil. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> Well. </seg>
<seg id="1056"> What did you learn about the handsome Greek? </seg>
<seg id="1057"> His name is Alexis, he is a count. </seg>

<seg id="1118"> According to you? </seg>
<seg id="1119"> I didn't like that I had to answer the phone. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> Type  "female revenge"? Or something like that? </seg>
<seg id="1121"> Something like this, yes. </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Any other director I would have already jumped on him. </seg>
<seg id="1123"> - I am not "any other director." - Bullshit. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> If you thought you could, you would have already done it. </seg>

<seg id="1160"> The icing on the cake. </seg>
<seg id="1161"> - You like it? - It is very nice my lady. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> I could almost fall in love with you when I see you with this collar. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> "Almost fall in love"? This means that you don't love me! </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I get bored, I whine constantly. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> Your Count? Is he? </seg>
<seg id="1166"> You're in love with him? </seg>
<seg id="1167"> He followed me to Florence! </seg>
<seg id="1168"> He does not love you. He just wants you, as he wanted a thousand others. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> Insolent animal! How dare you speak to me in that tone? </seg>
<seg id="1170"> - Bring me my boots. - Yes, ma'am. </seg>

<seg id="1178"> Yes, Mistress. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> And my legs. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> Yes, Mistress. </seg>
<seg id="1181"> Tomorrow maybe I will tie you to the fig tree that stands in the garden... </seg>
<seg id="1182"> .. and sting you with my golden clasp. </seg>

<seg id="1185"> Would you like this? </seg>
<seg id="1186"> Yes, Mistress. </seg>
<seg id="1187"> I am very pleased with you, Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> I might even give you a piece of candy. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Will there be anything else? </seg>

<seg id="1202"> Don't you feel great? </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Colluding here the two of us together... </seg>
<seg id="1204"> This place is so nice. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> And also so quiet. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> I do not know even where I am. - But think about it. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> A new life ahead of you, of us. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> There's just us. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> We and your friend, the Count. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> Stop bothering me by speaking about him. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> Haven't I punished you enough? here's the problem. </seg>

<seg id="1217"> You see? </seg>
<seg id="1218"> For an hour I'll let you imagine you are free. </seg>
<seg id="1219"> In the end you will understand that you are what I want. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> An animal. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> An object. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> An empty space to fill. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> No, I will not allow it. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> - I will not, I refuse. - I beg your pardon? </seg>
<seg id="1225"> - I wrote you a letter. - A letter? </seg>
<seg id="1226"> A "Dear John" letter, perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> "The degradation is too much, you have already become unbearable." </seg>
<seg id="1228"> The degradation claiming you... </seg>
<seg id="1229"> I can not recite this passage. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> - I do not see that happening. - How would it be? </seg>
<seg id="1231"> Yet it is clear enough. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> What should I do? In your head as you see the scene? </seg>
<seg id="1233"> But it is the time when... What was the line? </seg>
<seg id="1234"> - "I wrote you a letter." - A letter... </seg>
<seg id="1235"> A "Dear John" letter, perhaps? </seg>
<seg id="1236"> - The degradation claiming you... - Lay down a bit '. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> The degradation claiming you, you've already become unbearable? </seg>
<seg id="1238"> You have to listen to her for days... </seg>
<seg id="1239"> .. you have been afraid to show it. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> So? Where is it? </seg>
<seg id="1241"> Show me this masterpiece. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> A little 'fun would not make me sick. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> That's great, Tom. Are you strong. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> You should do you Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> No, no... </seg>
<seg id="1246"> But yes! </seg>
<seg id="1247"> You have to be Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> You understand her character better than me, you created her... </seg>
<seg id="1249"> .. you know her intimately. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> - I do not know her lines. - But of course you know them. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> - Pay attention, Séverin. - I do the best I can, Mistress. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> But as usual your best is not up to par. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> - Bring me my coat. - Yes, Mistress. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> Prepare a bottle of champagne and two cocktails. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> The Count Alexis will arrive at any moment. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> - But mistress... - If you don't like it, you can leave. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> Far from my sight. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> Your fur, Mistress. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> You will marry the Count Alexis, Mistress? </seg>
<seg id="1260"> I will not lie anymore, Séνerin. That man makes me shudder. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> Great! </seg>
<seg id="1262"> Wait! </seg>
<seg id="1263"> Sit down. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> It lives in my thoughts, I can not drive it away. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> It lives in my thoughts, I can not drive it away. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> - I'm suffering. - You're magnificent. </seg>
<seg id="1267"> - Still you love this suffering. - Get up and come back a little later. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> If you ask me to become your wife, I will say yes. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> You are magical. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> You know it's very jealous of you? </seg>
<seg id="1271"> I told him everything about the two of us. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> He probably has threatened to kill you. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> In fact... </seg>
<seg id="1274"> - The Count hit you? Yes </seg>
<seg id="1275"> - You liked it? Yes, it was sublime. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> More intense. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> - Yes, and it was sublime. - Even more intense. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> - He slapped you in the face? - Yes </seg>
<seg id="1279"> And it was sublime. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> - Oh! - I'll kill you, both of you. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> I tear out your heart, throw it to the dogs! </seg>
<seg id="1282"> You are cursed! </seg>
<seg id="1283"> - What curse? Yes, kill me Séverin! </seg>
<seg id="1284"> I'm sick of this comedy. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> What comedy? </seg>
<seg id="1286"> But how can you love me? I was terrible with you. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> I have done everything to save you... </seg>
<seg id="1288"> .. to heal, to show you how much I love you. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> All to no avail? </seg>
<seg id="1290"> None. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> It was just a game? A play? And the contract? </seg>
<seg id="1292"> Oh, the contract... </seg>
<seg id="1293"> My little, sweet, silly... </seg>
<seg id="1294"> S�verin, I loved you from the first moment. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> I could not tell you why. I am not who you think. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I am weak, and lost... don't you understand? </seg>
<seg id="1297"> Not bad. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> It is I who should be submissive. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> I who should be whipped and tied up. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> I think I will tie you to the statue with a pair of your socks. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> That's What you want, right? - Yes, I beg you. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> Do with me what you wish. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> - Promise to never leave me. - I'll never leave you, I swear. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Turn around. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> The hands? </seg>
<seg id="1306"> I've dreamed of this moment ever since I met you. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> Louder, louder. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> I humble myself. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Mortify, subdue me, I implore you. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> Very well, Tom. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> This should be really good. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> This is great. But you know what is the problem? </seg>
<seg id="1313"> Whatever we say or do, this piece is degrading. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> It is an insult to women. Your pornography. </seg>
<seg id="1315"> - But what are you saying? - A damsel in distress... </seg>
<seg id="1316"> .. a poor defenseless bitch who humbles herself before a man: </seg>
<seg id="1317"> "Beat me, hurt me, I'm just a woman." </seg>
<seg id="1318"> Holy cow! </seg>
<seg id="1319"> - Damn! - Are these emotions too strong? </seg>
<seg id="1320"> That's good. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> "I don't see this kind of anger these days." </seg>
<seg id="1322"> But Vanda... </seg>
<seg id="1323"> Thank me. </seg>

<seg id="1327"> You thought you could dupe the stupid starlet, huh? </seg>
<seg id="1328"> - To use her to satisfy your sick inclinations? - No. </seg>
<seg id="1329"> Like Frankenstein build yourself a little female of your own? </seg>
<seg id="1330"> - You believed you could use me to humiliate you? - No, Vanda. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> I swear! </seg>
