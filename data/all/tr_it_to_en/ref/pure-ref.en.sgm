<seg id="1"> You'll catch your death of pneumonia, mister. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Please... let's see some ID. </seg>
<seg id="3"> I must've... </seg>
<seg id="4"> I must've let it in... </seg>
<seg id="5"> Pneumonia for sure, mister. </seg>
<seg id="6"> You'll be warmer. </seg>
<seg id="7"> How long am I to stay in this shithouse? </seg>
<seg id="8"> Relax. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The Inspector's been told. </seg>
<seg id="10"> He's on his way. </seg>
<seg id="11"> At least you're dry. </seg>
<seg id="12"> You must be joking! </seg>
<seg id="13"> It's like a cheap American film. When do you read me my rights? </seg>
<seg id="14"> You can take off your shoes if you want. </seg>
<seg id="15"> I wet myself. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It happens sometimes. When you're old. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Isn't that so? </seg>
<seg id="18"> I have to make a call. Where's the phone? </seg>
<seg id="19"> Sorry, that's not possible. </seg>
<seg id="20"> What d'you mean - not possible? It's my right! I have to tell them I'll be late. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Drop it, it's not possible. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Ask the Inspector when he gets here. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Whoever you are, I'll also tell him how you treated me. You're in trouble. I'm not some nobody! </seg>
<seg id="24"> I don't have the honor of knowing you. But whoever you are, you'll see we don't play favorites here! </seg>
<seg id="25"> Get that through your head! </seg>
<seg id="26"> Tell the Inspector anything you like. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Can you tell me the time or do I have to wait for Bogart? </seg>
<seg id="28"> It's 9:15. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Shut up! </seg>
<seg id="30"> - Out that whistling! It drives me nuts! - Sit down!... </seg>
<seg id="31"> And keep quiet! </seg>
<seg id="32"> Sorry... I apologize. </seg>
<seg id="33"> It's just that I'm expected. I have a very important meeting. Very important. </seg>
<seg id="34"> With the Minister of Culture. </seg>
<seg id="35"> I have to prepare myself... I can't go like... </seg>
<seg id="36"> The Inspector's on his way. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Got a cigarette? Find him a cigarette. </seg>
<seg id="38"> But, captain, I don't smoke. Me neither. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The Inspector smokes, I hope. </seg>
<seg id="40"> An Inspector always smokes. </seg>
<seg id="41"> An Inspector smokes a pipe... An Inspector chomps on a cigar... </seg>
<seg id="42"> Drink this, It'll do you good. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Take it. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Drink. It'll warm you. Drink. </seg>
<seg id="45"> - Is it milk? - Yes, warm milk. </seg>
<seg id="46"> It'll do you good. Go on. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Drink. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Drink. </seg>
<seg id="49"> You son of a bitch! </seg>
<seg id="50"> Bastard! Bastard! </seg>
<seg id="51"> A nasty business. </seg>
<seg id="52"> We really needed this. </seg>
<seg id="53"> With this rain, I was better off in bed. </seg>
<seg id="54"> He's coming around. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Try to sit up. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Give him a hand. I'll manage, leave me alone. </seg>
<seg id="57"> I assume you're the Inspector. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Excellent assumption. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Well, then you owe me a few explanations. </seg>
<seg id="60"> By what right are you holding me here? Why wouldn't your men let me contact my family? Who authorized them to beat me like an animal? </seg>
<seg id="61"> Answer me. </seg>
<seg id="62"> I asked you three simple questions. </seg>
<seg id="63"> Ordinarily I'm the one who asks questions. </seg>
<seg id="64"> From what I hear, you brought this on yourself. Nonetheless, I'm sorry I'm late. </seg>
<seg id="65"> - As a rule, I'm quite punctual... - I don't care how punctual you are! </seg>
<seg id="66"> I have no desire to know it. </seg>
<seg id="67"> I just want to know what I'm doing here. </seg>
<seg id="68"> I'll try to satisfy your curiosity. </seg>
<seg id="69"> But first I'd like to know who I'm dealing with. Seeing as you were out walking miles from anywhere in a downpour, with no raincoat no... umbrella, nothing in your pockets, not even any ID... It's neither a felony nor a misdemeanor to be without ID. </seg>
<seg id="70"> It must be in my wallet on my desk... - Naturally. - ...or in another jacket. </seg>
<seg id="71"> But first, I'd like to know who it is I'm talking to. </seg>
<seg id="72"> A trucker? A boxer, a dentist, an astrologer? Maybe a judge, since you are such an expert on felony and misdemeanor, crimes? </seg>
<seg id="73"> Once people knew who I was before I even said hello. But I don't want to... take advantage of my celebrity. No... My name is Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="74"> And mine is Leonardo Da Vinci. </seg>
<seg id="75"> You don't believe me? </seg>
<seg id="76"> That's your right. </seg>
<seg id="77"> What's perhaps less your right is arresting people simply for walking in the rain. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Does rain bother you so much mister Leonardo Da Vinci? </seg>
<seg id="79"> I am Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="80"> If you doubt me, go get my ID or send your henchmen, </seg>
<seg id="81"> It's your work. </seg>
<seg id="82"> I own the farmhouse on the River Choron. I must've left it on the kitchen table or in a shirt pocket or on my bed. </seg>
<seg id="83"> "Even now I sometimes doubt I ever... lived those days, ever made fast that friendship, ever knew this man whose body has just fallen before my eyes. </seg>
<seg id="84"> This body gasped for breath, and I wrote these pages. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Those vacant eyes cried out for expression, those lips pleaded for a final whimper, this dream was missing a kind of dreamer..." </seg>
<seg id="86"> Charming little speech. And very well-said. But it leaves me cold. I don't understand it, Mr. Da Vinci. </seg>
<seg id="87"> What you call my little speech is quite simply a quote from a great novel by a writer named Onoff! Onoff... </seg>
<seg id="88"> You really have no luck, do you? No luck at all! Because in a place like this where nothing ever happens, you have plenty of time to read. </seg>
<seg id="89"> And I read a lot, days on end, weeks on end, book after book, book after book... </seg>
<seg id="90"> You can't imagine the number of books I read, even re-read the ones I like best: </seg>
<seg id="91"> "The Palace of Nine Frontiers", "Degrees", "Hatred", "Geometry", "A Treatise on Pleasure", "Nero", "The Two Torches"... All books by Onoff. He's my favorite writer. In my humble opinion, he's a genius. </seg>
<seg id="92"> You couldn't have made a worse choice. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Onoff... I know his biography like the back of my hand. </seg>
<seg id="94"> You see, old man, walking in the rain at night isn't too serious by itself. </seg>
<seg id="95"> Leaving your ID at home in a jacket pocket is merely stupid. Attempting to escape police custody, even the most inept, by assaulting officers of the law is a bit riskier. </seg>
<seg id="96"> But doing it all in the space of a few hours, then giving a false identity, that's... very, very risky. </seg>
<seg id="97"> Andre! </seg>
<seg id="98"> I'm ready, sir! It may not be necessary, I doubt it'll take long. Who is winning? Me, but he has the Mikado. The Mikado doesn't beat a steady hand. Fix me a cup of coffee. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Stand up. </seg>
<seg id="100"> What's your name? </seg>
<seg id="101"> Let's not waste time. Your name? </seg>
<seg id="102"> What's your name? </seg>
<seg id="103"> What's your name? Shit! </seg>
<seg id="104"> "He was standing by the armoire when Mrs. d'Oneiras' car drove into the courtyard. </seg>
<seg id="105"> The maid hurried out. She held the door open, curtseyed, then ushered her in. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Mrs. d'Oneiras slowly climbed the semicircular staircase. </seg>
<seg id="107"> She was beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="108"> She took a morsel of cooked fish from the pocket of her skirt and proceeded to eat it. </seg>
<seg id="109"> As she ate, she stared straight ahead, seeing nothing... </seg>
<seg id="110"> When she came in, he moved away from the armoire and went toward her, but she didn't look at him. </seg>
<seg id="111"> She passed by him, barely a centimeter away, as if he didn't exist." </seg>
<seg id="112"> That Mrs. d'Oneiras... </seg>
<seg id="113"> The bit of herring in the skirt pocket... </seg>
<seg id="114"> That's from "Degrees". It's when Mrs. d'Oneiras breaks off with him. </seg>
<seg id="115"> The middle of the book. Not "Degrees". </seg>
<seg id="116"> "Stairways", Inspector. </seg>
<seg id="117"> "Stairways", chapter three, </seg>
<seg id="118"> "The return of the Druze". </seg>
<seg id="119"> Giving a false identity is very risky, Leonardo Da Vinci, old prick! </seg>
<seg id="120"> Prince Cosimo's speech, before laying the tiles? </seg>
<seg id="121"> "That's why I followed you here, and that's why this park if full of kneeling men..." "...and derelict dancers..." </seg>
<seg id="122"> "And that's why in this frescoed corner, where these two walls meet..." "...you see squatting figures, defecating in the shadows." </seg>
<seg id="123"> Correct? </seg>
<seg id="124"> You say you know my biography like the back if your hand. </seg>
<seg id="125"> I am 48 years old. I've written novels, articles, songs, plays. </seg>
<seg id="126"> I myself directed, very badly, my last play, "Nero". </seg>
<seg id="127"> I've published nothing for 6 years. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Is that enough? </seg>
<seg id="129"> Onoff! </seg>
<seg id="130"> The great Onoff, here! </seg>
<seg id="131"> How could I not have recognized you right away? </seg>
<seg id="132"> It's... I... What can I say to apologize? Allow me to shake your hand. </seg>
<seg id="133"> I am sorry about the shabby welcome we gave you. </seg>
<seg id="134"> Never mind. Not a big deal. You're soaking wet! </seg>
<seg id="135"> Towels, quickly, and dry clothes! And shoes, too. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Would you like coffee? </seg>
<seg id="137"> Another coffee! </seg>
<seg id="138"> Just a moment, Mr. Inspector. May I make a call? Well, of course, but... The lines are busy. </seg>
<seg id="139"> How... how... How could I possibly have failed to recognize you? </seg>
<seg id="140"> I must have seen your face hundreds of times. </seg>
<seg id="141"> You know, flash bulbs, news, shots, TV... </seg>
<seg id="142"> - They conceal more than reveal. - Of course, but... </seg>
<seg id="143"> What is someone like you doing here in the middle of nowhere? </seg>
<seg id="144"> - I owe a house in the mountain, where sometimes... - Women! </seg>
<seg id="145"> If it pleases you to think so... I shouldn't pry into what doesn't concern me. I'm seldom here, unfortunately. </seg>
<seg id="146"> I go there to work. It helps me concentrate. </seg>
<seg id="147"> A new book? </seg>
<seg id="148"> You are writing a new book, er! I've guessed, have I? </seg>
<seg id="149"> Bravo, you've guessed. </seg>
<seg id="150"> And... have you been here long? Three or four days. </seg>
<seg id="151"> I got there Thursday, today's Sunday. That makes four. </seg>
<seg id="152"> The beard! That's it! You always had a beard, that's why I didn't recognize you! </seg>
<seg id="153"> Coffee, Mr. Inspector. </seg>
<seg id="154"> I brought you shoes. Can you open the door? Yes. I am going. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The gardener's boots. </seg>
<seg id="156"> A bit too big, but at least they're dry. Doesn't matter. Thanks. Thanks. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Sorry about what happened earlier. How is your hand? </seg>
<seg id="158"> Don't worry. I'll survive. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Thanks for the boots. </seg>
<seg id="160"> Well, Inspector, nothing left but to thank you  for your kind words about my work. </seg>
<seg id="161"> No, I'm the one to thank you. </seg>
<seg id="162"> You don't know how happy I am to have met you, to have shaken the hand that creates the world where I so enjoyed living. </seg>
<seg id="163"> I wouldn't like to abuse your hospitality but, if you could have me driven home... </seg>
<seg id="164"> Yes, of course. That way, I can return the clothes and the boots. </seg>
<seg id="165"> Of course. Of course, but... this is very awkward... how to tell you... </seg>
<seg id="166"> My ID? I'll send that back, too. </seg>
<seg id="167"> No, it's not that. </seg>
<seg id="168"> What is it, then? Nothing serious, I assure you... </seg>
<seg id="169"> But... You'll have to stay a while longer. </seg>
<seg id="170"> - All right, if you think it's necessary... - As I said, nothing major. A few questions. Just a formality. </seg>
<seg id="171"> It won't take long. I'd appreciate that, I'm very tired. </seg>
<seg id="172"> You wanted to make a phone call. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Give me a number, I'll have it put through. </seg>
<seg id="174"> Easy to remember. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Is it your number? </seg>
<seg id="176"> No... A lady friend of mine. </seg>
<seg id="177"> Andre... Put this number through to my direct line, 93... </seg>
<seg id="178"> What's the subject of your new book? </seg>
<seg id="179"> Is this an interview? </seg>
<seg id="180"> Since you know me so well, you know I quit giving them years ago. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Yes, of course. Though I never understood why. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Interviews are pointless. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Someone visits you to make you say, what he already knows, for the pleasure of hearing you repeat it. In a way, yes. </seg>
<seg id="184"> But it's different with me. </seg>
<seg id="185"> I want you to tell me everything you did today. Today, Sunday. And that, I assure you, is something I don't know. </seg>
<seg id="186"> So it's not an interview. It's an interrogation. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Call it what you like... But I ask you to bear with me. </seg>
<seg id="188"> It's not easy to put these questions to a man I admire so much. - Then don't do it. I must, Mr. Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="189"> I must. It's your own interest. </seg>
<seg id="190"> As you see, we are alone, noting you say will be taken down. </seg>
<seg id="191"> Tell me how you spent your day, and when you are finished, I give you my word, we'll leave you in peace. </seg>
<seg id="192"> Got a cigarette? I am sorry, nobody here smokes... </seg>
<seg id="193"> All right, never mind. Forget it. </seg>
<seg id="194"> You smoke a lot? </seg>
<seg id="195"> Three packs a day. A bit more lately. </seg>
<seg id="196"> And today? Today I broke all records. </seg>
<seg id="197"> What time did you wake up this morning? I always wake up in 3:30 in the morning. </seg>
<seg id="198"> How can you be so precise? I don't sleep much. An hour, an hour and a half... Never more than two. Every day for the last ten years I've woken up at exactly 3:30 in the morning. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Just like Shannon in "Geometry". Right, like the hero of "Geometry". </seg>
<seg id="200"> - It's an obsession with you. - I guess it is. </seg>
<seg id="201"> I must say I was surprised when you didn't recognize my quote: </seg>
<seg id="202"> "Those lips pleaded for a final whimper". It's magnificent... </seg>
<seg id="203"> Do you remember the names of all you suspects? Everyone you arrested, questioned, sent to jail? </seg>
<seg id="204"> You remember their faces, their hair, every word they said? Frankly, I doubt it. </seg>
<seg id="205"> No one can remember everything. </seg>
<seg id="206"> That passage you quoted, might be from "The Palace...", maybe... </seg>
<seg id="207"> That's it, that's it! </seg>
<seg id="208"> Beginning of the last chapter! It is magnificent! We were discussing insomnia. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Yes. I had insomnia, too. For years. </seg>
<seg id="210"> I tried everything, every remedy possible or imaginable... </seg>
<seg id="211"> Sleeping pills by truckload. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Nothing helped. </seg>
<seg id="213"> Then, a few years ago, all at once it stopped, like that. Overnight. </seg>
<seg id="214"> Don't lose hope. Maybe it'll happen to you. </seg>
<seg id="215"> I don't want my insomnia cured. </seg>
<seg id="216"> It suits me fine, it's my number-one collaborator. It means I can write while others sleep. </seg>
<seg id="217"> Did you also work last night? - Less than usual. - Did you went back to sleep? No. </seg>
<seg id="218"> No? Then, what did you do? </seg>
<seg id="219"> I stared for ages at the ceiling. And the ceiling stared for ages at me. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Alone? </seg>
<seg id="221"> I mean, you were alone in bed? </seg>
<seg id="222"> You, Inspector, are a man of boundless tact. </seg>
<seg id="223"> Yes, I was alone. You were alone. And then? </seg>
<seg id="224"> Then I got up before cock-crow. </seg>
<seg id="225"> I put on my robe and my slippers, one by one. </seg>
<seg id="226"> I went down to the kitchen. </seg>
<seg id="227"> I drank a cup of coffee accompanied by a spoonful of sugar. </seg>
<seg id="228"> I took a huge crap. </seg>
<seg id="229"> I scratched my head. I washed myself, dressed. Made a phone call, tore up everything I'd written yesterday, and made notes on what I'd write tomorrow. </seg>
<seg id="230"> And then I went for a walk. </seg>
<seg id="231"> After that I came back home and reorganized the attic. </seg>
<seg id="232"> And then? </seg>
<seg id="233"> Then, I drove to the train station to pick up my agent. </seg>
<seg id="234"> What's your agent's name? - Danielle. - Danielle what? </seg>
<seg id="235"> Danielle February. </seg>
<seg id="236"> You drove to the train station to pick up Danielle February? </seg>
<seg id="237"> - Then? We had lunch, we talked about work... </seg>
<seg id="238"> Later on I took her back to the station. What time? </seg>
<seg id="239"> Between 5 and 6 in the evening. </seg>
<seg id="240"> She left and I went home. What time? </seg>
<seg id="241"> About 7. And then? </seg>
<seg id="242"> Then... - Then? Then? </seg>
<seg id="243"> I don't remember very well. </seg>
<seg id="244"> You don't remember very well? </seg>
<seg id="245"> No, I don't remember. </seg>
<seg id="246"> You don't remember? </seg>
<seg id="247"> But...You went back home, after the station, in 7 in the evening... </seg>
<seg id="248"> I can't remember... I've forgotten, I've... It's ridiculous! </seg>
<seg id="249"> You don't remember what you did just a few hours ago? </seg>
<seg id="250"> You think that's normal? Is it a crime to forget? </seg>
<seg id="251"> You are bullshitting me, Mr. Onoff! </seg>
<seg id="252"> Bullshitting me! Up my ass, Inspector! </seg>
<seg id="253"> What do you think I did? Why does it matter? </seg>
<seg id="254"> - What do you care? - OK, let's begin again. From the top. </seg>
<seg id="255"> This changes everything, Mr. Genius. </seg>
<seg id="256"> I sincerely wanted to help you, </seg>
<seg id="257"> I have the greatest respect for what you do, for you work... But until you and your memory make contact, you are not leaving here. </seg>
<seg id="258"> Help me? I don't need help. What do you suspect in your hidebound little hick-cop brain? </seg>
<seg id="259"> Let's start. Name? </seg>
<seg id="260"> What's your name? </seg>
<seg id="261"> It's a simple question, dammit! </seg>
<seg id="262"> I won't answer until I've made a phone call. You can't call and you won't call. </seg>
<seg id="263"> You can't call. </seg>
<seg id="264"> I have the right to call my lawyer! </seg>
<seg id="265"> I won't answer your stupid questions without my lawyer! </seg>
<seg id="266"> Look here... - I know your rights. </seg>
<seg id="267"> You've refused me everything from the start! </seg>
<seg id="268"> First your guardian angels: "Ask the Inspector, wait for the Inspector". Then you... "Give me the number, I'll get it on my direct line". </seg>
<seg id="269"> Why can't I call from this jerkwater dump? </seg>
<seg id="270"> The lines are out of order. Good enough? </seg>
<seg id="271"> Well, Inspector, in all my career as a writer I never indulged in such exuberant flights of fancy. Hats off! </seg>
<seg id="272"> It's true, Mr. Onoff. whenever there is a storm, the first thing to go is the phone. In fact, it's a wonder we still have power. </seg>
<seg id="273"> - You should've said before. - I give my word, </seg>
<seg id="274"> once the lines are fixed, you'll be the first to call. </seg>
<seg id="275"> Go on. Your name? - Why? - Why what? These questions. Please, your name. Why this interrogation, Inspector? </seg>
<seg id="276"> Someone was murdered tonight not far from your house. </seg>
<seg id="277"> Sit down. </seg>
<seg id="278"> Congratulations, Inspector, you've already got your killer. </seg>
<seg id="279"> I don't think for a second that you are a killer. But if you keep trying me to make me believe that you don't remember a thing you did after 7 in the evening, I'll be forced to think you are. </seg>
<seg id="280"> So, your name, if you please. My name is Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="281"> Place and date of birth. February 3, 1946, in Vercere. </seg>
<seg id="282"> - Profession. - Writer. - Married? - Twice married. </seg>
<seg id="283"> Meaning... My first wife died not long after our wedding. </seg>
<seg id="284"> In what circumstances? Cancer. </seg>
<seg id="285"> You remarried? I divorced nine years ago. </seg>
<seg id="286"> Children? None. </seg>
<seg id="287"> Prior offences? Like what? How many times I ripped off a supermarket? How many people I killed before tonight? </seg>
<seg id="288"> Denies any prior offences. </seg>
<seg id="289"> What brought you to this wasteland? I've already told you twice. </seg>
<seg id="290"> I came to my farmhouse to concentrate. Away from everything. Away from police inspectors. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Were you alone? Just a second, sir. </seg>
<seg id="292"> - Were you alone when you came to the house? - No. </seg>
<seg id="293"> Who was with you? My wife. </seg>
<seg id="294"> You married a third time? </seg>
<seg id="295"> No, I mean my second wife. My former second wife, if you prefer. </seg>
<seg id="296"> - You reconciled? No, no. We see each other regularly. </seg>
<seg id="297"> You might say we've become friends. Well... almost friends. </seg>
<seg id="298"> How many bedrooms is there in your farmhouse? </seg>
<seg id="299"> When we are together we sleep together if that's the question. </seg>
<seg id="300"> So, when you woke at 3:30 in the morning to contemplate the ceiling, you weren't alone? </seg>
<seg id="301"> Obviously not. Why did you tell me you were? </seg>
<seg id="302"> I didn't say that. Read the transcript. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Not now! Before you said you woke up just before cock-crow and you were alone. I made a mistake! </seg>
<seg id="304"> Anyway, we are always alone. </seg>
<seg id="305"> How long have you been here? About nine days. </seg>
<seg id="306"> How can you be sure? How can I be sure? </seg>
<seg id="307"> If I say nine days, it's nine days! - Why did you tell me four? - I didn't say four! You did, you said four days. So, I counted wrong. </seg>
<seg id="308"> I loose all track of time when I work Besides... That's why we work: to lose consciousness. </seg>
<seg id="309"> Listen to me, Mr. Onoff. If you contradict yourself in your novels or your poems, that's fine. But if you keep contradicting yourself in a murder investigation, then that's... </seg>
<seg id="310"> Any more and we'll all drawn! </seg>
<seg id="311"> We'll take care of it, Mr. Inspector. </seg>
<seg id="312"> How can you live in a place like that? </seg>
<seg id="313"> How can we live in a place like this! </seg>
<seg id="314"> We are ready, Mr. Inspector. </seg>
<seg id="315"> Excuse me! </seg>
<seg id="316"> Yes? </seg>
<seg id="317"> A while back, I noticed... Bottles. I think it was wine. </seg>
<seg id="318"> Could I have some? </seg>
<seg id="319"> It's a good wine. </seg>
<seg id="320"> Best in the region. </seg>
<seg id="321"> - Here. - Thanks. </seg>
<seg id="322"> Thanks. </seg>
<seg id="323"> - Good, eh? - I'll say! </seg>
<seg id="324"> Have some more. To bring you luck. </seg>
<seg id="325"> It's February 3rd. You birthday, right? </seg>
<seg id="326"> So it is. Yes, indeed. </seg>
<seg id="327"> Can I ask you a question? What else do you do here? </seg>
<seg id="328"> When I whistled that tune before, you got mad, remember? </seg>
<seg id="329"> It wasn't you I was mad at. I am sorry. I apologize. </seg>
<seg id="330"> Let's give them a hand. </seg>
<seg id="331"> No, it's because... I know I whistle off key but... - You recognized the tune? - I recognized it. </seg>
<seg id="332"> I guess everyone in the world had told you that. But... To me that song is a big part of my life. </seg>
<seg id="333"> Here we go! What'd I tell you! </seg>
<seg id="334"> Come sit down please. </seg>
<seg id="335"> Andre, I don't know where the candles are. </seg>
<seg id="336"> Look around, they are over there! </seg>
<seg id="337"> Hurry up! </seg>
<seg id="338"> Mister! Mister! I'll pour you some more wine. Where's your glass? </seg>
<seg id="339"> Andre, open up! What's going on? Break down the door! </seg>
<seg id="340"> - Your name? - Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="341"> Date and place of birth. </seg>
<seg id="342"> February 3, in Vercere. Saint Blaise's day. </seg>
<seg id="343"> - Year? - 1946. </seg>
<seg id="344"> - Profession? - Writer. </seg>
<seg id="345"> - Married? - Twice. </seg>
<seg id="346"> - Children? - None. </seg>
<seg id="347"> How many days ago did you come to your country house? </seg>
<seg id="348"> Four. </seg>
<seg id="349"> First you said four, then nine. Now it is four again? </seg>
<seg id="350"> Four. </seg>
<seg id="351"> Who did you come with? </seg>
<seg id="352"> My ex-second wife. </seg>
<seg id="353"> - What's your ex-second wife name? - Danielle. </seg>
<seg id="354"> Danielle February. </seg>
<seg id="355"> Isn't that your agent? The same thing. </seg>
<seg id="356"> What does that mean? It means my ex-second wife is my agent. </seg>
<seg id="357"> So she is the one you took to the train station? Yes. </seg>
<seg id="358"> What time? Before dusk. </seg>
<seg id="359"> What did you do then? I stayed home. </seg>
<seg id="360"> You stayed home? Or you went home? </seg>
<seg id="361"> I stayed home all day long. </seg>
<seg id="362"> All day long... </seg>
<seg id="363"> Can I have some wine? </seg>
<seg id="364"> If you didn't leave home all day long, how could you take Danielle February to the station? </seg>
<seg id="365"> I didn't take her. She went by herself. </seg>
<seg id="366"> After she left, who came to see you? </seg>
<seg id="367"> Nobody. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Are you sure? I am sure. </seg>
<seg id="369"> I didn't go out all evening. Please believe me. </seg>
<seg id="370"> What did you do after your ex-second wife left? Answer. What did you do? </seg>
<seg id="371"> I don't remember what I did next. </seg>
<seg id="372"> But you say you didn't go out all day. </seg>
<seg id="373"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="374"> How do you know, if you don't remember what you did? </seg>
<seg id="375"> Don't remember... </seg>
<seg id="376"> Could we say you didn't go out during the time you remember? Yes. </seg>
<seg id="377"> So it's possible you went out... afterward. </seg>
<seg id="378"> I don't remember. </seg>
<seg id="379"> I no longer ask you to remember. </seg>
<seg id="380"> Merely to admit you've been talking a load of crap! </seg>
<seg id="381"> First you claimed you came here alone, your agent came to visit, and you took her to the station. Somewhere between 5 and 5:30. </seg>
<seg id="382"> Then thinking it over, you came with your wife. Your ex-wife. Your ex-second wife, who's also your agent. </seg>
<seg id="383"> Only you didn't take her to the station, she took herself to the station. </seg>
<seg id="384"> Mr. Onoff... </seg>
<seg id="385"> At that station... At that station, not so much as one lousy train has stopped for one lousy minute since you came to your farmhouse. For the simple reason that there's never been a station here! </seg>
<seg id="386"> Never! </seg>
<seg id="387"> You are not worthy of the books you've written. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Your novels, your poems, your plays, your songs are a better bargain then you are. I hope so. </seg>
<seg id="389"> Now let's say the truth. Confess! You are making the biggest mistake of your career, which I would guess is not particularly brilliant. </seg>
<seg id="390"> Then why did you try to run off like a thief? </seg>
<seg id="391"> Why don't you prove your innocence? Why not put an end to my suspicions? </seg>
<seg id="392"> I'll tell you why. Because tonight you committed murder. </seg>
<seg id="393"> I don't know if anyone was murdered. </seg>
<seg id="394"> If someone was murdered, I don't know where. If somewhere someone actually was murdered, I don't know who. A little old lady, a child, a goat, a scarecrow! </seg>
<seg id="395"> You don't know a thing, yet it's you who'll tell us who the victim is. </seg>
<seg id="396"> You accuse me of murder and I'm supposed to name the victim? You are supposed to tell me who it is! </seg>
<seg id="397"> What kind of cop are you? A retard, a madman? </seg>
<seg id="398"> I was never an ace detective and maybe I never will be. But during my not particularly brilliant career </seg>
<seg id="399"> I've handled a lot of homicides. Some I never solved. In others I made some fancy deductions which turned out to be all wrong. Once in a while I was lucky enough to stumble on the right trail and discover a few little keys which worked very nicely in a few little locks. </seg>
<seg id="400"> Very rarely I broke the case using my own intelligence. </seg>
<seg id="401"> But this is the first homicide I've dealt with where the only mystery left to solve is the identity of the corpse. </seg>
<seg id="402"> Unfortunately, I can't do it. The victim's face is horribly mutilated and we can't start identification proceedings until tomorrow. </seg>
<seg id="403"> Know what I think? </seg>
<seg id="404"> No. </seg>
<seg id="405"> I think you are the murderer. </seg>
<seg id="406"> You killed the guy, and the ideal scapegoat came along just at the right time! </seg>
<seg id="407"> How do you know it's a man? - What man? - You said: "Know what I think? You are the murderer. You killed the guy." </seg>
<seg id="408"> You're twisting my words! </seg>
<seg id="409"> But you do know it's a man! </seg>
<seg id="410"> I don't know anything! You are trying to confuse me. </seg>
<seg id="411"> You know very well whether it's a man or a woman. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Either way, you have no evidence against me. </seg>
<seg id="413"> A trivial lapse of memory doesn't prove a thing. </seg>
<seg id="414"> "Trivial lapse of memory"... </seg>
<seg id="415"> "So as not to die of anguish or of shame, men are eternally condemned to forget the unpleasant moments of their lives. </seg>
<seg id="416"> And the more unpleasant they are, the faster they are forgotten." </seg>
<seg id="417"> This... That's by you, my dear Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="418"> The man who has written this must have done something very unpleasant indeed to make him forget this actions of just a few hours ago. If writers knew whose mouths end up spewing out their works, they'd cut off their hands. </seg>
<seg id="419"> And it would be a pity. </seg>
<seg id="420"> You believe in God? After all, He is the Great Writer. </seg>
<seg id="421"> If He'd had to allow for the morons who'd later lay claim to His works, to give up too many plans. It's not hard to believe in God. </seg>
<seg id="422"> I believed in Him many times. But I must say I was often ashamed for Him. </seg>
<seg id="423"> He would've been an excellent writer, if only He'd stuck to describing scenery. </seg>
<seg id="424"> Excuse me, Mr. Inspector. I didn't quite get that. </seg>
<seg id="425"> Mr. Onoff, here present, claims God is a second rate writer. </seg>
<seg id="426"> Why do you get so annoyed when I quote your books? </seg>
<seg id="427"> My job is to write. Hearing about my works doesn't interest me. </seg>
<seg id="428"> Language no longer has any purpose in today's world. </seg>
<seg id="429"> It's only good for police interrogations. </seg>
<seg id="430"> I see why you haven't published in six years. </seg>
<seg id="431"> I thought it was another of your creative breakdowns. </seg>
<seg id="432"> What are you talking about? </seg>
<seg id="433"> Three years of silence preceding "The Palace of Nine Frontiers". </seg>
<seg id="434"> It's a long time ago, but... I recall the press went on about breakdown. Breakdown, an endless terror of the blank page, right? </seg>
<seg id="435"> Bravo! </seg>
<seg id="436"> You know more about me than I remember myself. That's for sure! </seg>
<seg id="437"> Disappointed? </seg>
<seg id="438"> Frankly, yes. </seg>
<seg id="439"> We should never come face to face with our own idols. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Seen close up, they turn out to have pimples. </seg>
<seg id="441"> We may find out that the great works which inspired our dreams were thought up while sitting on the john, during a bout of diarrhea! </seg>
<seg id="442"> Aside from me, do you have many enemies? Oh, yes! </seg>
<seg id="443"> One made a face at me just today and I don't know why, but I killed him. </seg>
<seg id="444"> Have you ever owned a gun? </seg>
<seg id="445"> No. Sure? </seg>
<seg id="446"> I've never owned a weapon of any kind. </seg>
<seg id="447"> I don't know how to shoot, I've never shot. </seg>
<seg id="448"> You are going in circles, Inspector. You'd better to question the body you hid down below. </seg>
<seg id="449"> What makes you think it's a body? I saw it myself when you took it out of the van. Look, all you can accuse me of is manhandling a couple of cops. The rest is hocus-pocus! You have no solid evidence! </seg>
<seg id="450"> No grounds to hold me for murder! </seg>
<seg id="451"> You don't even know the victim's name! </seg>
<seg id="452"> Tomorrow I have a meeting with the Minister of Culture! </seg>
<seg id="453"> You'd better release me, or else... You're about to commit another crime! </seg>
<seg id="454"> I advise you to keep quiet. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Sit. </seg>
<seg id="456"> I'll take your advise and keep quiet. </seg>
<seg id="457"> My dear Onoff, I don't rule out the possibility that I'll fail to prove your guilt. </seg>
<seg id="458"> No.In a way, I hope that's the case. But you won't have any meeting with any Minister till you tell me what you did after dusk. Even at the risk of hearing you spent the whole time parked on the john with a monumental bout of diarrhea! </seg>
<seg id="459"> D'you want me to move the desk, Mr. Inspector? </seg>
<seg id="460"> It'll keep us awake. </seg>
<seg id="461"> We're in for a long night. </seg>
<seg id="462"> Right, get on with it. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Does your ex-second wife remarry? </seg>
<seg id="464"> Does she live with someone? </seg>
<seg id="465"> Does she have a lover? </seg>
<seg id="466"> I'll take your advise and keep quiet. Improbable as it seems, let's suppose neither you nor your ex-second wife knew the area. So she didn't go to the "station", but went to "look for a station". To look for a station nearby, in order to leave. </seg>
<seg id="467"> But in this case how would you get the car back? </seg>
<seg id="468"> I'll take your advise and keep quiet. </seg>
<seg id="469"> Maybe... She went to look for a station with someone else. Someone who afterward went back to your place. Who? </seg>
<seg id="470"> I'll take your advise and keep quiet. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Or simpler still, she never left. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Maybe she stayed with you to keep your company? But in this case, where was she when my men arrested you? </seg>
<seg id="473"> Why were you running so out of breath you couldn't talk? </seg>
<seg id="474"> I'll take your advise and keep quiet. </seg>
<seg id="475"> is that your ex-second wife's number? </seg>
<seg id="476"> I'll take your advise and keep quiet. </seg>
<seg id="477"> You expressly asked to call that number! Then you implied the victim could be a man! To cover your ass. To throw us off course. </seg>
<seg id="478"> Is the victim the woman whose number is 93633396? </seg>
<seg id="479"> If it's not her, how many potential victims does a man have, a man of renown, a recluse, whom no one has seen for several years? </seg>
<seg id="480"> How many know you well enough to know where to find you, here, in the middle of nowhere, where even you say you seldom come? </seg>
<seg id="481"> The list can't be enormous. </seg>
<seg id="482"> A friend? </seg>
<seg id="483"> A mistress? </seg>
<seg id="484"> A relative? </seg>
<seg id="485"> The chauffeur? The secretary? </seg>
<seg id="486"> Your doctor? Your lawyer? </seg>
<seg id="487"> One of your collaborators? </seg>
<seg id="488"> A journalist? </seg>
<seg id="489"> A photographer, chasing a scoop? </seg>
<seg id="490"> A student who's pestered you for years with a series of inane questions? </seg>
<seg id="491"> Your editor? </seg>
<seg id="492"> Which one came to see you yesterday afternoon? </seg>
<seg id="493"> I'll take your advise and keep quiet. </seg>
<seg id="494"> You come from a military family. Your father was a hero in the war. You yourself were an officer. And I'm to believe you've never held a gun? </seg>
<seg id="495"> Go on, take my advice and keep quiet! </seg>
<seg id="496"> That's enough, Onoff! </seg>
<seg id="497"> Stop it, stop it. </seg>
<seg id="498"> We've changed the tune, Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="499"> Nobody plays games with me. </seg>
<seg id="500"> As your biography is world-famous, I know it by heart. </seg>
<seg id="501"> He was born in a ditch, at the edge of a field. </seg>
<seg id="502"> She who borne him severed the cord with her teeth, tied it off and left. </seg>
<seg id="503"> They baptized him Blaise February, because he was found on a freezing night in February, and because it was the feast day of Saint Blaise. </seg>
<seg id="504"> I am Blaise February! </seg>
<seg id="505"> My biography is a lie, </seg>
<seg id="506"> from beginning to end. I wrote it myself. </seg>
<seg id="507"> An old man made up a new name for me, worthy of a writer. The name Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="508"> He was called Faubin. He was my best friend. </seg>
<seg id="509"> It's thanks to him that I became great. </seg>
<seg id="510"> I was never in the army, </seg>
<seg id="511"> never fired a gun. </seg>
<seg id="512"> I grew up in an orphanage. </seg>
<seg id="513"> They gave us milk... every day warm milk, morning and evening. </seg>
<seg id="514"> I detest warm milk. </seg>
<seg id="515"> Paula, get me a cup of coffee, would you? </seg>
<seg id="516"> I've had a nightmare... a terrifying nightmare. </seg>
<seg id="517"> I dreamt I killed my editor, and took back my manuscript. I ran and ran and ran to your place. </seg>
<seg id="518"> But your house had turned into a police station with a strange inspector... He recited all my books by heart. </seg>
<seg id="519"> Paula, get me some paper, I have to write all this down. </seg>
<seg id="520"> Paula... </seg>
<seg id="521"> It's a mess... </seg>
<seg id="522"> I've never seen the inspector like this. </seg>
<seg id="523"> If you ask me, he's stumped. It's a funny situation. Proof, he needs proof. </seg>
<seg id="524"> - The captain says not. - That asshole. </seg>
<seg id="525"> Ignore him. He's basically OK. They're all nice here... </seg>
<seg id="526"> I still have to get used to it, I need time. I never thought... </seg>
<seg id="527"> What time is it? </seg>
<seg id="528"> You slept an hour. </seg>
<seg id="529"> Cold; want to warm yourself? </seg>
<seg id="530"> Can I have some paper? I want to make some notes. </seg>
<seg id="531"> Well... sure. </seg>
<seg id="532"> Give him some hot wine. </seg>
<seg id="533"> - An idea for a new book? - You don't write because you have an idea, but because you can't do anything else. </seg>
<seg id="534"> Shit! </seg>
<seg id="535"> Shit! </seg>
<seg id="536"> - Really, that... - Shut up. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Just shut up. </seg>
<seg id="538"> When I tell people this, nobody'll believe me. </seg>
<seg id="539"> How can a place as absurd as this possibly exist? </seg>
<seg id="540"> True. It's no place for a world traveler like you. </seg>
<seg id="541"> We don't have anything. It's not a big city. Nothing here but the forest. I've had my job here for fifteen years. </seg>
<seg id="542"> I've always liked it fine. Wouldn't catch me in a city, not even dead. </seg>
<seg id="543"> The typewriter. Could I use the typewriter? </seg>
<seg id="544"> It's logical, it's logical, but... - Yes, come on. - ...but you have to ask the Inspector. </seg>
<seg id="545"> Is it possible to kill and not remember? </seg>
<seg id="546"> Remember, to remember... It's so easy to look back, old memories trapped in amber, pain and sorrow tingled with black, everything in amber, everything in amber. We must learn how to forget, A much harder thing to do, we must go on without regret, Wipe clean the slate and start anew. Erase the past and look ahead... </seg>
<seg id="547"> Ever seen this man, Mr. February? </seg>
<seg id="548"> Seems to me I know him. </seg>
<seg id="549"> Who is he? </seg>
<seg id="550"> My math teacher, when I was in high school. </seg>
<seg id="551"> What else? </seg>
<seg id="552"> It's to him I owe my passion to numbers, for symmetry, geometric reasoning. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Professor Trivarchi... </seg>
<seg id="554"> He set forth theorems as if they were fables. </seg>
<seg id="555"> His words didn't go through our ears, they went directly to our minds. </seg>
<seg id="556"> His lessons were sincere and pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="557"> "Two parallel lines can never meet. Nonetheless, it is possible to imagine the existence of a point so far out of space, so far into infinity, that we can admit and acknowledge, that our two lines do in fact meet there. </seg>
<seg id="558"> So it is. </seg>
<seg id="559"> We shall call this point the ideal point". </seg>
<seg id="560"> - Never saw her before. - Are you sure? </seg>
<seg id="561"> Well? Yes... </seg>
<seg id="562"> Yes, I know her. And..? </seg>
<seg id="563"> She's a girl I once loved. </seg>
<seg id="564"> Can you tell me when you saw her last? </seg>
<seg id="565"> One morning I left her sleeping at the hotel. I went to the airport. I didn't even say goodbye. </seg>
<seg id="566"> That was twenty years ago. </seg>
<seg id="567"> Where did you find these pictures? </seg>
<seg id="568"> Figure it out for yourself! I've been looking for them for so long... </seg>
<seg id="569"> Were you looking last night, too? </seg>
<seg id="570"> Yes... Last night, too. </seg>
<seg id="571"> I've been looking high and low for ages and ages, and never found them. Not just these two. There were a whole lot of them... A mountain of pictures. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Why are they so important? </seg>
<seg id="573"> I don't know. They are relics of a strange habit of mine, or, if you prefer, a vice I practiced almost all my life. </seg>
<seg id="574"> I always used to carry a small camera. I collected the faces of everyone I met, everywhere I went. Sort of an unorthodox way of keeping a diary. </seg>
<seg id="575"> A game I gave up, the very day I made up my mind to retire from public life. </seg>
<seg id="576"> After that I mislaid them. </seg>
<seg id="577"> All my friends and all my enemies are in those pictures. The people I love and used to love, those I didn't know how to or didn't want to love. </seg>
<seg id="578"> Those who shook my hand and smiled, and those who looked at me just looked without saying anything. Thousands and thousands and thousands of faces. </seg>
<seg id="579"> Where did you get them? We simply searched your farmhouse. </seg>
<seg id="580"> You obviously didn't look very heartily. </seg>
<seg id="581"> All these faces... </seg>
<seg id="582"> Who is he? </seg>
<seg id="583"> Faubin. </seg>
<seg id="584"> Faubin? </seg>
<seg id="585"> The man who made up the name of Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="586"> A bum! </seg>
<seg id="587"> Yes... </seg>
<seg id="588"> A bum. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Is he the one who's... the one you met yesterday evening? </seg>
<seg id="590"> How could I have! </seg>
<seg id="591"> It's to his memory that I dedicated "The palace..." </seg>
<seg id="592"> Dedicated? </seg>
<seg id="593"> You should know that. You never dedicated a book to anyone. </seg>
<seg id="594"> Everyone knows that. </seg>
<seg id="595"> That... That's impossible. </seg>
<seg id="596"> Impossible? </seg>
<seg id="597"> Please don't stain it. </seg>
<seg id="598"> It... It's impossible! </seg>
<seg id="599"> Maybe you dedicated to him a book that... a book that was never published? An unsubmitted book? </seg>
<seg id="600"> No... </seg>
<seg id="601"> It could only be this one. </seg>
<seg id="602"> Why? Why this one particularly? </seg>
<seg id="603"> Faubin vas a vagrant. </seg>
<seg id="604"> The most intelligent man I ever met. </seg>
<seg id="605"> I never managed to learn anything about his past. </seg>
<seg id="606"> He refused to talk about it. </seg>
<seg id="607"> But I always believed he'd been someone really important. </seg>
<seg id="608"> When my books began to sell, I offered to help him, but he wouldn't give up his hideaways under the bridges. </seg>
<seg id="609"> He was a bit crazy. </seg>
<seg id="610"> He spent his time writing on the backs of old calendars or in notebooks, whatever he could find in garbage cans. </seg>
<seg id="611"> He wrote floods and floods and floods of words that made no sense. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Then one day, I got a letter from him. I opened it. I saw that for the first time, he'd written something intelligible, more than intelligible. Each... each... each phrase reflected the most subtle rules of grammar. </seg>
<seg id="613"> I understood that he was dead. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Yes, but... why say you dedicated a book to him if you didn't do it? </seg>
<seg id="615"> Some time later, I went through a terrible dry spell. </seg>
<seg id="616"> I couldn't write. I couldn't live. </seg>
<seg id="617"> For weeks on end I sat at my desk and found I have nothing to say. </seg>
<seg id="618"> I often thought about that deluge of nonsense, those thousands and thousands of words which were Faubin's gift to me. </seg>
<seg id="619"> I began to read and re-read it all. - Looking for what? - I couldn't believe that before he died he wrote such a touching letter, so perfect... while he'd spent his life rummaging through humanity's garbage, stringing words together without rhyme nor reason. </seg>
<seg id="620"> For three years all I did was work on this gargantuan puzzle. </seg>
<seg id="621"> Right, the press talked about my silence, breakdown. Writer's block, misantropia. But I managed to channel my hunger into a fever of excitement. </seg>
<seg id="622"> A thousand times I took apart this ocean of words, syllable by syllable. And at last I found the solution to the mystery. </seg>
<seg id="623"> It was unbelievably simple. </seg>
<seg id="624"> Faubin didn't write, he merely copied what was already written in his head. </seg>
<seg id="625"> He transcribed the words into 9 notebooks, all at the same time, breaking down sentences the way you break down a number. </seg>
<seg id="626"> It was rare to find two words which made any sense, next to each other, unless it was by accident. </seg>
<seg id="627"> It was extraordinary! </seg>
<seg id="628"> When I'd finally reconstructed his work, it was simply magnificent! </seg>
<seg id="629"> I never would've believed anyone could write something so pure, so... so unique. </seg>
<seg id="630"> I wish I could've read it. </seg>
<seg id="631"> You did. </seg>
<seg id="632"> I published it under the title of "The Palace of Nine Frontiers". "The Palace of Nine Frontiers", signed by me. </seg>
<seg id="633"> It was a phenomenal success after all those years of silence. </seg>
<seg id="634"> But I was finished, and only I new it. </seg>
<seg id="635"> Alcohol became my only joy, and I needed joy every second. </seg>
<seg id="636"> I despise to my soul everything I've written since. </seg>
<seg id="637"> I'll never reach such heights again. </seg>
<seg id="638"> But I'm condemned to write despite everything, because when I write, it's as if I were drinking. </seg>
<seg id="639"> My art is no more than a contemptible drug. </seg>
<seg id="640"> I hate the people who keep pushing me to publish what I write. </seg>
<seg id="641"> What I write solely to keep from drinking. </seg>
<seg id="642"> Who is pushing you to publish? </seg>
<seg id="643"> My editor, for one. </seg>
<seg id="644"> When was the last time you saw him? I don't remember. </seg>
<seg id="645"> Yesterday? </seg>
<seg id="646"> You think I killed him? Did he visit you at your house on the Choron? </seg>
<seg id="647"> I don't remember. What did you do yesterday, after you looked for the pictures? </seg>
<seg id="648"> I don't know. I kept on looking... Looking for this? Yes. </seg>
<seg id="649"> Where did you go after that? </seg>
<seg id="650"> After that... I set down and stared... Haven't you ever stared out of the window for hours and hours, without seeing anything? </seg>
<seg id="651"> Then? </seg>
<seg id="652"> Paula came. </seg>
<seg id="653"> Paula? </seg>
<seg id="654"> Up to now, you've said you were with Danielle February! </seg>
<seg id="655"> Only Paula came to the farmhouse. </seg>
<seg id="656"> I never see Danielle. Who's Paula? </seg>
<seg id="657"> Who's Paula? </seg>
<seg id="658"> Who's Paula? </seg>
<seg id="659"> She's everything... </seg>
<seg id="660"> Why wouldn't you talk about her before? </seg>
<seg id="661"> Because you always feel great embarrassment at being loved. </seg>
<seg id="662"> Paula. </seg>
<seg id="663"> So... Paula came to the farmhouse with you. </seg>
<seg id="664"> She stayed a few days, then left. </seg>
<seg id="665"> Maybe even yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="666"> Then she came back, in the afternoon. Right? </seg>
<seg id="667"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="668"> Why'd she come back so soon? What happened? </seg>
<seg id="669"> I don't want to go back home. </seg>
<seg id="670"> She wants to take you home? </seg>
<seg id="671"> Why does Paula to take you away? </seg>
<seg id="672"> I want to be alone. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Go with them. Go with Stephane... </seg>
<seg id="674"> Who's with Paula? </seg>
<seg id="675"> Friends. Insufferable friends. </seg>
<seg id="676"> Stephane? </seg>
<seg id="677"> Who's Stephane, your editor? </seg>
<seg id="678"> Go on. Go, I'll join you tonight. </seg>
<seg id="679"> Why do you want to be alone? </seg>
<seg id="680"> You cut your hair? </seg>
<seg id="681"> Yes. Why? </seg>
<seg id="682"> Why did you shave off your beard? </seg>
<seg id="683"> I want to look... to look at myself. </seg>
<seg id="684"> You want to see yourself as you haven't seen yourself in years. </seg>
<seg id="685"> Then? What happened then? </seg>
<seg id="686"> I can't find the words. </seg>
<seg id="687"> I don't know what to say. </seg>
<seg id="688"> You tried to write something? </seg>
<seg id="689"> You wrote this. </seg>
<seg id="690"> "I have nothing to say that can be said. </seg>
<seg id="691"> I would've preferred silence, my faithful friend. Elegant, flawless, suitable for every occasion. But for all that I've been able to live in isolation of the most absolute kind. I now feel an absolute desire to say thank you, to apologize and give some explanations, a sign, though I don't know what. Forget me often. Forget... Onoff." </seg>
<seg id="692"> The only one you didn't recognize. </seg>
<seg id="693"> Faubin took it. </seg>
<seg id="694"> I think... I think I was five. </seg>
<seg id="695"> I gave you my word. </seg>
<seg id="696"> If you still want to call... </seg>
<seg id="697"> Hello? Paula, it's me. It's me, Paula. Me, Onoff. Do you hear me? - There is nobody there - I have to talk to you. To tell you so many... Listen, please listen to me! Hello? It's me, Onoff. I have to tell you something important, you hear? - You hear? - Hello? Forgive me, Paula. - Anybody there? - I am sorry, I've done something... something terrible. Why can't you hear me! </seg>
<seg id="698"> Tell the Minister not to expect me. </seg>
<seg id="699"> Drink this, it'll do you good. </seg>
<seg id="700"> Go on. </seg>
<seg id="701"> - Is it milk? - Yes. </seg>
<seg id="702"> Warm milk. Drink it. </seg>
<seg id="703"> He doesn't know yet? You didn't know, either. Neither did I, They didn't either, or the Inspector. Nobody knows when they first come here. </seg>
<seg id="704"> Going to be a nice day. </seg>
<seg id="705"> A good sign, Mr. Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="706"> Can I ask you something? Of course. </seg>
<seg id="707"> Can I take my pictures with me? </seg>
<seg id="708"> We don't have the right to do this, because whatever I take away must be put back exactly as it was. </seg>
<seg id="709"> But who's going to miss a few photographs you yourself mislaid? </seg>
<seg id="710"> In my office... on the table... - Above the left-hand drawer... - Your manuscript? The manuscript of my new novel. Did you take it? </seg>
<seg id="711"> No. </seg>
<seg id="712"> Too bad... But I read a few pages. It's good, It's sufficient just to have a look to say it's extraordinary. It's really very, very good, superb. </seg>
<seg id="713"> I think it's your best work, better than the others you wrote. Better than the one you didn't write, as well. </seg>
<seg id="714"> It's going to be a huge success. </seg>
<seg id="715"> Excellent... Have a nice trip. </seg>
<seg id="716"> Have a nice trip, Mr. Onoff. </seg>
<seg id="717"> Thank you, Mr. Inspector. </seg>
<seg id="718"> By the way, what's your name? </seg>
<seg id="719"> Call me Leonardo Da Vinci. </seg>
<seg id="720"> Thanks, Mr. Leonardo Da Vinci. </seg>
<seg id="721"> You are in a good job. Difficult, but... </seg>
