1
It was the phenomenon of the 1920s.
2
If you think that at the time it was as famous as Lindbergh ... it's really sophisticated.
3
Its history reflects the nature of our civilization ... the character of our times. Yet it is also the story of a man ... and there are all the issues of our culture ... heroism, will, things like these ...
4
but when one thinks about it, it was really weird.
5
It is ironic to see ... how quickly it has vanished from our memory ... considering the impressive record he had established.
6
It was very funny, of course ... but at the same time it did touch something inside people ... maybe in a way they would prefer to avoid.
7
It is certainly a very bizarre story.
8
The year is 1928.
9
America, which has come from a decade of unprecedented prosperity, is crazy.
10
The age of Jazz, so it was called. Rhythms are syncopated, costumes are more relaxed. Liqueurs are less expensive when they are found.
11
It is an era of heroes of various kinds, of discredited acrobatics ... of clandestine bars and gorgeous festivals.
12
A typical party takes place in the Long Island estate ...
13
of Sutton ... people in sight and patrons.
14
Politicians and poets ... are elbow with the cream of high society.
15
The party is featured by Scott Fitzgerald ... who sets a 20th century portrait on paper ...
16
for subsequent generations. He writes on his notebook ... something about a curious little man, named Leon Selwin, or Zelman ... who seemed undoubtedly an aristocrat ... and exalted the riches' talents while chatting with the people of the beautiful world.
17
He spoke of Coolidge and the Republican Party with veneration ... all with a refined accent of Boston.
18
"An hour later," writes Fitzgerald ... "I was stuck in seeing the same person ..." talking to the kitchen guards.
19
"This time he claimed to be a Democrat ..." and his accent was cruder, as if he were one of the people "... This is the first time Leonard Zelig has been told.
20
Florida, a year later.
21
There is a strange incident ... in the New York Yankees training camp.
22
Journalists, as always anxious ... to immortalize the great batters' business ... notice a strange new player ... waiting for his turn after Babe Ruth.
23
He's listed as Lou Zelig ... but none of the team ever heard about him.
24
Guards are called ... and escorted out of the facility.
25
The fact appears in a loophole in the newspapers of the next day.
26
Chicago, Illinois, same year.
27
There is a private party ... in a clandestine bar on the South Side.
28
People belonging to respectable classes ... dance and drink distilled gin in the house.
29
That evening is Calvin Turner, a waiter.
30
There was a lot of gangsters in the room.
31
They give us good tips and treat us well. And we treated our customers well.
32
In that particular evening, it's a weird guy. I never saw her before ... so I ask the other waiters ...
33
"John, do you know that guy?" Have you ever seen him? "He looks at it and ..." No, never seen before.
34
"I do not know who he is ..." but what I know is that he has the tough air "...
35
So I look again and ... the guy was gone.
36
I do not know where she went ... but at that moment usually the music starts ... and the band starts playing. Have a look and I see a kind of color that plays the trumpet.
37
Damn, it did not sound bad at all! I look good at the guy ... and I say "it looks like that gangster before ..." but that was white, while this guy is black "... and just did not realize it was happening ...!
38
New York City. A few months later.
39
The police are investigating the disappearance of an employee ... named Leonard Zelig.
40
Both her homeowner and her employer ... have reported her disappearance.
41
They describe it to the Police as a strange little man who was on his own.
42
There are two clues in the Zelig apartment at Greenwich Village.
43
The first is a photograph of Zelig with Eugene O'Neill ... the other one where he looks like the protagonist of "Pagliacci".
44
Based on a blown, they trace him around Chinatown ... where, in the back of a Chinese shop ... an oriental odd look is found ... which corresponds to Leonard Zelig's description.
45
Surprised, the investigators try to tear off camming ... but it's not a camouflage, and a brawl breaks.
46
He is taken away by force and led to the Manhattan Hospital.
47
In the ambulance, she shouts and angers ... in a language that seems to be just Chinese.
48
It is held firmly with the jacket.
49
When he comes out of the car, he is no longer a Chinese ... but a white man.
50
The doctors, disconcerted, send him to the emergency room ... in observation.
51
By 7, Dr. Eudora Fletcher, a psychiatrist ... is doing his usual lap.
52
When I heard of this particular case ... I did not think of anything special ... and when I first saw him ... it was a little strange, because I switched it to a doctor.
53
He had a way to behave very ... professional.
54
As a young psychiatrist he was ... Eudora Fletcher is fascinated by Leonard Zelig.
55
It convinces the members of the hospital staff, quite traditional ... to let them study the new patient.
56
- What profession do you do? - I? I'm a psychiatrist.
57
- Oh yes? - I work especially with paranoids.
58
- You talk to me. - Oh, there is not much to say.
59
I work mostly in Europe ... and I've written several articles of psychoanalysis.
60
I studied a lot. I worked with Freud in Vienna.
61
Our disagreement began with the envy of the penis.
62
Freud maintained that it should be limited to women.
63
It was not what he said was completely meaningless.
64
It was a mixture of obscure phrases in jargon by psychologists ...
65
which he had probably heard somewhere ... or had learned by reading.
66
The funny thing was that his talk was really smooth ... and he could even be convincing ... for someone not in the trade.
67
Who was this Leonard Zelig, who seemed to stir everywhere ... so different impressions?
68
All we know about him is that he was a son ... of a Jewish actor named Morris Zelig ... whose interpretations of Puck ... in the Hebrew-orthodox version of "Midnight Midnight Dream" .. He was coldly received.
69
The second wedding of Father Zelig ... is characterized by a series of violent quarrels so much that ... although the family is dressed up on a bowling ... it's just from bowling noise that comes to the noise.
70
As a child, Leonard is often targeted by anti-Semites.
71
His parents, who never take his defenses ... and if they take it with him for anything, they go for anti-Semites.
72
They often punish him by locking him in a darkroom.
73
When they are angry ... they enter the closet with him.
74
On the deathbed, Morris Zelig tells his son ... that life is a useless nightmare full of suffering ... and the only advice it is given is to keep the laces of the shoes used.
75
Though his brother Jack has a nervous breakdown ... and his sister Ruth is a thief and an alcoholic ... Leonard Zelig seems to have adapted to life.
76
Somehow, he can arrange himself.
77
Then, suddenly, an increasingly strange behavior.
78
Fascinated by the Zelig phenomenon ... Dr. Fletcher organizes a series of experiments ... and invites skeptical colleagues to observe.
79
Under the eyes of the doctors, Zelig becomes a perfect psychiatrist.
80
When two Frenchmen come in ... Zelig takes care of their character and speaks a discreet French.
81
Alongside a Chinese ... it begins to take on an oriental look.
82
At this point, the story is leaked to the press ... and the audience, always thrilled with emotions and novelties ... has been attracted to it.
83
The shock is so ... that Dr. Allan Sindell is forced to make a statement.
84
Let's just begin to understand the real dimensions ... of what might be the medical discovery of the century ... if not all the time.
85
Every day, the press publishes new details ... on Zelig and its disconcerting condition.
86
Although the doctors claim to have the situation under control ... they do not even agree on the same diagnosis.
87
It depends on the endocrine system. Although there is no evidence of dysfunction ... I am sure that further analysis will confirm the problem.
88
He took it by eating Mexican food.
89
They are neurological symptoms.
90
The patient suffers from a brain tumor ... and I would not be surprised if he died in a few weeks.
91
We have not been able to locate the tumor yet ... but we are looking for it.
92
Ironically, it was Dr. Birsky ... to die of brain tumor within two weeks.
93
Leonard Zelig is fine.
94
During these weeks of experiments and guesses ... Eudora Fletcher begins to guess ... that the patient might suffer ... not a physiological disorder ... but a psychic.
95
It is Zelig's unstable physical constitution that suggests ... the explanation for his metamorphosis.
96
The doctors advice is hostile to his theory.
97
They conclude that Zelig's disease ... would be attributed to a defect in alignment of the vertebrae.
98
The tests prove they are wrong ... and cause a temporary problem to the patient.
99
Now, the press and the public cling to every little news ... totally taken from this human drama.
100
The saga of the strange creature of the Manhattan Hospital continues.
101
Experiences have been made today. Women of various kinds were placed close to the subject ... but there was no change. It would be deduced ... that the phenomenon does not occur with women.
102
Later, doctors will experiment with a dwarf and a chicken.
103
Leonard Zelig continues to astonish doctors at the Manhattan Hospital ... after numerous tests have failed ... to determine the nature of this amazing phenomenon.
104
At the request of doctors, the patient meets two overweight men.
105
While men talk about their obesity, Zelig, after an initial reticence ... joins them, reaching the incredible weight of 113 pounds.
106
Then, in the presence of two blacks ...
107
Zelig quickly becomes like them.
108
What will they invoke next time?
109
Meanwhile, the first reactions of Americans come.
110
I would like to be Lenny Zelig, the Transformer.
111
I would be so many different people, and maybe my wishes would come true.
112
Leonard Zelig is one of the finest lords ... of all the United States of America.
113
It is a portent.
114
Tell me why I take the characteristics ... of the person you are with.
115
It's safe.
116
What do you mean by "safe"?
117
It's safe to be like the others.
118
Do you want to feel safe?
119
I want to be welcome.
120
Penetrating in Zelig's mouth ... Dr. Fletcher slowly puts together the pieces ... of that puzzle that is the behavior of Zelig.
121
Passing the time between the hospital ... and the 42nd street library, fill in your account.
122
The doctors, during a private meeting, listen to Dr. Fletcher ... describing Zelig as a "human chameleon".
123
Like the reptile, endowed with nature ... of a wonderful defense system ... which makes it capable of changing color ... and confusing with the surrounding environment ... also Zelig protects ... becoming anyone be near.
124
Doctors listen and their reaction is skepticism.
125
"Impossible," they say. "Absurd".
126
"If it's a lizard," jokes one of the doctors ... "we should not spend the hospital's precious money to feed it ..." but it would simply be enough to catch some fly. "
127
Well, we knew we had a good story, that time ... because it was inside of it all. Feeling ... suspense.
128
That one, Zelig, was born poor.
129
My editor-in-chief told me "Ted, this story ..." we want her on the front page every day "...
130
At that time, he would do his best to sell newspapers.
131
Usually she was taking a story, she was brave ... she exaggerated, she took some freedom with the facts.
132
But that was a real, genuine story.
133
It was enough to say the truth and sell newspapers. It never happened before!
134
Suddenly, Leonard Zelig became ... the main topic of conversation everywhere ... and he talks about it with amazement and fun.
135
There is no worldly gathering where there is no joke on Zelig ... and, in a decade characterized by so many dancing in vogue ... a new dragging the nation.
136
What is white, black and yellow, and has four eyes?
137
Leonard Zelig at the League of Nations.
138
Not everyone, anyway ... are enchanted by the human chameleon ... and among the extremist fanatics ... it becomes a convenient symbol of iniquity.
139
This is personifies the capitalist man.
140
A creature that takes many forms, to achieve ... its purposes, the exploitation of workers by deceit.
141
For Ku Klux Klan, Zelig ... a Jew capable of transforming ... into a nigger or a punk, is a threefold threat.
142
Meanwhile, Dr. Fletcher ... confident of the correctness of his discoveries ... begs to be given more time with the patient ... to put into practice his theories.
143
Do you remember when you started to behave like someone around you?
144
At school, my good companions asked me if I'd read Moby Dick.
145
- And then? - I was ashamed because I did not read it.
146
- So you pretended? - Yup.
147
When did the mutations begin to happen automatically?
148
Years ago. At St. Patrick's Day.
149
I went into a bar. I was not dressed in green.
150
They made comments. I become Irish.
151
Would you tell them to be Irish?
152
My hair became red, my nose turned me up.
153
I spoke of famine and gnomes.
154
We do not agree with Dr. Fletcher's ideas.
155
We believe that they are all fairy tales.
156
A change in Zelig's disease ... can only be achieved through some experimental medicines ... which, though risky, make wonders.
157
Zelig is treated with an experimental drug ... the somdrile hydrate.
158
It is going through severe mood changes ... and for several days it does not leave the wall.
159
Then, suddenly ... when Dr. Fletcher begins to get results ... Zelig's fate is taking a new turn ... when his sister Ruth amazes everyone by taking him away from the hospital.
160
"At home, you will be better cared for," he tells doctors.
161
Explain that he will be better assisted by her and her lover, Mertin Geist, of a misunderstanding ... a businessman and former Luna Park impresario.
162
There is little resistance from doctors ... happy to get rid of such a frustrating case.
163
Only Dr. Fletcher is interested in Zelig as a human being.
164
He insists he desperately needs special care ... but it's all worthless.
165
No, no one questioned his legal rights over Zelig.
166
She was her sister-in-law and she was reliant on her ... but she had a strange boyfriend, named Geist.
167
He had been in jail for real estate scams.
168
He sold the same property ... to a lot of different people.
169
A Delaware MP bought it twice.
170
The crowd lurking along the streets to see the escape ... the human chameleon blocks traffic for days.
171
It is an attraction for tourists and children.
172
People coming from all over the country get stuck for some space ... to take a look at this new wonder.
173
Souvenir sale ... while the brother is exhibited ... it's just the beginning, for Ruth Zelig and Martin Geist.
174
They pay the entrance for the two daily demonstrations ... of Leonard's extraordinary skill.
175
He does not disappoint anyone ... and he changes continuously, on request.
176
Suddenly, it has become an attraction, a novelty ... a barbarian phenomenon.
177
In this 1935 film based on Zelig's life ... and titled "The Man Who Changes" ... this atmosphere is well described.
178
I can not give up. I know that if I have the chance I can cure it.
179
It's useless. The lawyer also says there is no hope.
180
Seriously, Dr. Fletcher ... can I call you Eudora?
181
Believe me, behind that vacuous face, that zombie look ...
182
there is a real human being, and I can make it come out.
183
- As? - I'll find the way.
184
A new technique. Whatever it is, it must be very personal.
185
I can not do it very legally. I'll try ...
186
They do not care about him. They exploit it.
187
In him they only see a chance to make money. Look.
188
They are already selling Leonard Zelig's doll.
189
The film did not exaggerate. There were not only pens and lucky lucky Leonard Zelig ... but also watches, toys, books ... and a famous Zelig puppet.
190
There were aprons, chamois-like earmuffs ... and a very popular Zelig game.
191
There were many famous songs ... inspired by Leonard Zelig, motives that dragged the whole nation.
192
In addition to products and sponsorships ... there are performances that do not end there.
193
Hollywood is very courteous ... and they offer him a contract for a movie.
194
Clara Bow invites him for a weekend with her ... and asks him to bring all his personalities.
195
Chicago meets the heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey ... who jokes with Zelig in the retreat he trains.
196
In Washington DC, they present him to Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover.
197
In France they call it "Le lézard" ... and become the main attraction of the Parisian music halls.
198
His business makes him dear to the main French intellectuals ... who see in him a symbol of everything.
199
His transformation into rabbi ... is so realistic that some French ... propose to be sent into exile on the Island of the Devil ...
200
At "Le Folies Bergère" ... Josephine Baker makes his version of the Chameleon Ball ... and later tells his friends ... that he found Zelig upbeat but somewhat lost.
201
Everyone came to my room ... I mean, all they counted ... and sometimes somebody carried us Zelig ... that is, Leonard ...
202
Cole Porter was fascinated by Leonard ... and once wrote a verse of a song ...
203
"You're the tops, you're Leonard Zelig" ... but he could not find anything he could do with Zelig.
204
"Flying up ..." because I feel I'm falling in love ... "falling in love with you and no one else.
205
"You've caught my gaze ..." and now I feel I'm falling in love.
206
"Show me that ring and I'll jump in.
207
"I was traveling alone." I had a chance to meet you ... "and now I feel a shiver for you.
208
"Hey, Mr. Zelig, he's ready ..." because I feel I'm falling in love ... "falling in love with you and no one else."
209
Although performances and parties ... come to Zelig's sister and her lover of wealth and fun ... Zelig's existence is actually a non-existence.
210
Without his personality ... his human qualities long lost in the drag of his life ... he sits alone, quietly staring at the void. It's a figure, a nullity, a joke of nature.
211
He just wanted to be part of something ... to walk between his enemies without being noticed, being loved ... he is neither involved nor part of anything ... he is strictly observed by his enemies and is not loved .
212
Everyone, in the hospital staff, forgot Zelig.
213
Only Dr. Fletcher continues to struggle to gain protection.
214
The court rejects its last appeal.
215
During his brave legal battle ... he is frequently in the company of his lawyer, Charles Koslow.
216
She falls in love with her ... and she asks her to marry her.
217
She is ambiguous.
218
With reluctance, he starts abandoning ... any hope of recovering Leonard Zelig.
219
That summer, Geist organized an exhibition in Spain.
220
It is the last stop of a European tour ... which has had a remarkable success.
221
The relations between Martin Geist and Ruth Zelig ... have been made.
222
They got tired of each other ... and they quarrel often.
223
The situation gets worse when you know Luis Martinez ... a mediocre and evil bullfight ... of whom he falls in love.
224
Though he wanted to impress Ruth Zelig ...
225
Martinez shows in the arena of his usual panic.
226
Luck is, however, on his side, this time ... because the bull gets a cerebral emotion.
227
Martinez takes credit for the killing ... and, cut the ear of the bull ... he offers it to his lover with a bribe.
228
That night, in jealousy access ... Martin Geist returns to his hotel room ... and faces Ruth Zelig. She asks you to give him his ear.
229
She refuses. Geist insists he has the ear.
230
They argue furiously, and you find out Martinez ... hiding in the closet.
231
Geist pulls out a gun and shoots him.
232
Then he turns his weapon to Zelig's sister-in-law and kills her. At that point, suicide. In an orgy of jealousy and violence ... Leonard Zelig's life is overturned.
233
At first, news comes to the fore in the world.
234
Then, with the same speed ... the audience, always thirsty of emotions, becomes indifferent.
235
New scandals get news headlines.
236
Everything moves so fast in the Jazz Age ... fast as Red Grange.
237
A saturated audience of distractions forgets quickly.
238
The 1920s culminated in a very serious crisis ... and Leonard Zelig is unavailable.
239
Dr. Eudora Fletcher seeks to find it unnecessarily. After many runs have turned out to be disappointing ... renunciation, discouraged.
240
I felt like a pity. It was a unique case ... with which I could build a solid reputation.
241
Not that I knew how to cure it ... but being able to have it alone ... finding the right path and being innovative and creative ...
242
I felt that I could change her life ... if only I had the chance.
243
Shoulder strap with 12 men ...
244
the gestational chair carrying the Holy Father reaches the central balcony ... from which the Pope will bless Rome and the whole world.
245
It has been for 63 years that this ceremony was not taking place ... that on this Sunday of Easter will end the rites of Holy Week.
246
What's happening? A hustle and bustle near the Holy Father.
247
There is an intruder.
248
Guards are called, while his sanctity Pius XI tries to hit the intruder with a pontifical decree.
249
The faithful do not believe in their eyes.
250
This is of course Zelig.
251
He is sent back to the United States ... from the Italian authorities ... and is again hospitalized at the Manhattan Hospital.
252
I am grateful for the opportunity to have Leonard Zelig in charge ... now that he is again under the hospital's responsibility.
253
I am glad that I have been granted this opportunity.
254
I sincerely hope to return to society a good citizen, master of self ... and no longer a circus phenomenon without identity.
255
Dr. Fletcher no longer has time to think about marriage. Now all her attention must be to Leonard Zelig.
256
His intention is to move him to his country house.
257
It will create a neutral environment, far from society.
258
He will seek new therapies to heal him ... in the hope of understanding his singular illness.
259
Aware of the importance of his work ...
260
Eudora Fletcher has a movie recording ... of the healing cycle.
261
In this regard, contact his cousin Paul Deghuee ... inventor and photographer in a timely manner.
262
He told me "I want to document this case ..." for future generations and for the scientific community.
263
"I want you to make the camera extremely silent."
264
I said, "Why do not you just take written notes?"
265
and she said, "Paul, when a man ..." changes his physical appearance, one must see it in action.
266
"You can not just read it." And besides, I'm going to go to history. "
267
The White Room is prepared with care ... to ensure maximum tranquility.
268
It's a small study at Dr. Fletcher's home ... furnished with a few furniture.
269
They are briefly nailed to the reflector walls for photography ... to have enough lighting.
270
Microphones are hidden at strategic points.
271
The camera is placed behind a glass panel ... which makes it fairly discreet.
272
The problem is motor noise. They dampen it with a blanket and with what they find underneath.
273
From this privileged but uncomfortable position ... photographer Paul Deghuee will feature ... the famous White Room Seats ... an outstanding document in the history of psychotherapy.
274
For current standards ... the White Room sessions appear very primitive ... and yet they were really effective ... in developing a very strong personal relationship ... between doctor and patient.
275
If Zelig was psychotic ... or just extremely neurotic ... it was a problem that we doctors ... we discussed constantly.
276
Personally, it seemed to me that his moods ... were not so different from the norm ... maybe those of a normal person ... well balanced and inserted ... only, brought to an extreme degree ... carried excess.
277
It seemed to me that we could ... in the end consider the conformist as antonoma.
278
Leonard, do you know why you're here?
279
To talk about psychiatry, right?
280
You are a doctor?
281
Yes. Have you read my article on manic paranoia?
282
In the end I found out that it's all a matter of head.
283
And if I told you not to be a doctor?
284
I'd say you're joking.
285
Is there always so much light here?
286
Oh, I'm filming these sessions. Hope you do not mind.
287
- No. Is anybody out there behind? - Yup.
288
A camera?
289
Leonard, why do not we go from the simple facts?
290
- Leonard, you're not a doctor - no?
291
No. You're a patient. I'm the doctor.
292
I would not say too many people if I was in you.
293
Leonard, you're not a doctor.
294
Can I leave it here alone? I...
295
I have to go back to town. Really. I have an interesting case. I follow two pairs of twin siamese twins with personality splitting. And I'm paid by eight people.
296
"The first week of sessions did not go very well ..." Dr. Fletcher writes in his diary.
297
"Leonard identifies with me ..." and is convinced he is the doctor.
298
"It is circumspect and suspicious.
299
"But it also has something very attractive." He has a mind awake and full of energy.
300
"Perhaps it is his helplessness that moves me.
301
"I have to stay flexible and go ahead with the intuition."
302
How are you doing today, Leonard?
303
Good. But I have to go back to town.
304
I have a masturbation course at the psychiatric institute and ...
305
- I understand - I'm a doctor. And ... "Masturbation dictated by guilt ..." No, no sense of guilt. I teach to an advanced level.
306
"I'm a very respected physician, Leonard, I wish ... that your eyes follow the pen and that you breathe deeply.
307
- Because? Thing? - Take it easy...
308
No. You're trying to hypnotize me ...
309
- You dry? - Of course I'm dry. I am a doctor.
310
- It's not true. - Yes, it is true.
311
- Relax - No, I can not. I have to go back to town.
312
I have the masturbation course.
313
If they do not start without me.
314
As the weeks pass ... Dr. Fletcher is increasingly frustrated.
315
"Leonard continues to insist on being a doctor ..." and even refuses to let go of hypnotism, "he writes.
316
"I think his last year's experience ..." have put him defensive as never before.
317
"It's daunting." It was in a state of great pressure ... it was just a bad thing, nervous. He was fine, he was sleeping, reading sitting in his armchair. He referred to himself as "Dr. Zelig". He read psychiatric books.
318
I told her to go away for a few days and relax a little. He was pulling the rope too far.
319
Leaving Zelig alone ... Dr. Fletcher accepts Paul Deghuee's advice ... and takes some hours of relaxation with her boyfriend.
320
They go to Broadway, then to a famous night club where ... despite the spectacle being lively ... Dr. Fletcher is distracted and uncomfortable.
321
He can not think of anything other than his patient.
322
The atmosphere between her and her boyfriend Koslow is embarrassing.
323
He is baffled by his obsession with Zelig.
324
Ironically, it's just in the smoky and noisy environment ... of the Night Club that Eudora Fletcher ... is blown away by a brilliant and innovative idea ... which will lead to a clumsy turn in the case.
325
- Dr. Zelig? - Yup?
326
Could you help me solve a problem?
327
I can definitely try it. I can not promise anything, obviously.
328
The other day I was in the presence of pretty educated people ... who discussed the novel Moby Dick ... and I was afraid to admit I had not read it, so I lied.
329
I wanted so much to be accepted, to be like the others, to be different.
330
- It's natural. - I really do everything to integrate.
331
But she is a doctor, she should know how to handle it.
332
But the fact is, in fact ... I'm not a real doctor.
333
- It is not? - No, doctor.
334
No, I'm pretending to be up to my friends.
335
You know, I'm a doctor.
336
What a story! just
337
But she is a doctor and can help me. It must help me.
338
To tell the truth ... I do not feel very good.
339
All my life was a lie.
340
I pretended to be one after the other.
341
She needs help, ma'am.
342
The other night I dreamed I fell in the fire. What does it mean?
343
It's terrible. I do not know. I...
344
Please, doctor. I know I'm a tough patient.
345
- Jesus. I do not feel very good. - What's my problem?
346
What do I know? I'm not a doctor.
347
- It is not? - No. Is that it?
348
- Who are you? - What does it mean, who am I?
349
- They are difficult questions. - Leonard Zelig.
350
- Definitely. Who is? - She.
351
No. I'm nobody. I'm nothing.
352
Take me ... I'm falling!
353
Playing with his identity disorder ...
354
Dr. Fletcher has skillfully pushed Zelig into a moment of disorientation.
355
As his defenses are lowered, he hypnotizes him immediately.
356
Using the post-hypnotic suggestion ... he will now be able to induce him in trance to his pleasure.
357
My brother beat me.
358
My sister beat my brother.
359
My father beat my sister and my brother and me.
360
My mother beat my father and sister and me and my brother.
361
The neighbors were killing the whole family.
362
Those of the other isolated beat our neighbors and our family.
363
I'm 12 years old.
364
I'm in a synagogue.
365
I ask the Rabbi the meaning of life.
366
He tells me the meaning of life ... but he explains it in Hebrew.
367
I do not understand Hebrew.
368
Then he wants $ 600 to give me Jewish lessons.
369
Dr. Fletcher's therapy consists of a two-way attack.
370
During the trance state, the personality will be ... deeply analyzed and restructured. In the conscious state ... she will give you love, affection ... and an unconditional respect.
371
You will be completely sincere.
372
You're in a deep trance.
373
You will not become what you believe I want you to be, but only yourself.
374
Tell me, what do you think about this accommodation?
375
It sucks.
376
I hate the campaign.
377
I hate grass and mosquitoes.
378
And the kitchen ... Your kitchen is terrible.
379
Your crêpe ...
380
I'm ... I throw it in the garbage every time you turn.
381
And those jokes you're trying to tell ... when you think you're funny ... they're long and meaningless, they never end.
382
I see. What else?
383
I want to come to bed with you.
384
It surprises me. I did not think I liked you a lot.
385
I love you.
386
Seriously?
387
You're so sweet, because ... you're not smart as you think you are.
388
You're confused ... and nervous, and you're a bad cook.
389
Those crêpe ...
390
Oh, I love you.
391
I want to take care of you.
392
Basta crêpe ...
393
I had started ... trying to use Leonard to make me a reputation. Then I found that I had strong feelings for him.
394
I never thought I was attractive.
395
I had never been in love really.
396
Charles Koslow was the kind of man ... my mother thought I should marry.
397
Feeling more confident with the patient ... Dr. Fletcher brings him out, with caution ... to spend an afternoon at his sister's house in the nearby Teaneck.
398
Meryl Fletcher is an avid ... an excellent professional pilot.
399
Eudora Fletcher is an amateur pilot ... and the afternoon runs fast while relaxing ... and they talk about old flight experiences.
400
As the weeks pass ... Zelig is encouraged to open more and more ... and to express his personal opinions.
401
Since it was early, it soon became expansive.
402
I hated my stepmother, and I'm afraid if you come to know.
403
I love baseball.
404
No matter what it means, it's just nice to see.
405
I am a Democrat. I've always been.
406
Are you sorry if I do not share your taste on that disc?
407
- Of course not. - You know, Brahms is always ... too melodramatic for me.
408
You have to be yourself and make your choices ... even when they require courage, or you're like a robot, or a lizard.
409
Will you really put that lawyer up?
410
I would prefer not to.
411
No, I do not agree. I think that Mussolini is a loser.
412
Will we ever make love?
413
Three months have passed ... and the hospital staff wants to examine the patient.
414
Dr. Fletcher says Zelig is not yet ready to leave.
415
Doctors decide to visit it on the spot.
416
The date is set: 4 days later.
417
If the progress becomes unsatisfactory ... they will take it away from its care.
418
I was very nervous because she was awake ... she did not remember anything about her trance state ... and I was wondering if there was a way ... to link the two events.
419
I was also afraid that ... putting him in front of strong personalities ... he could lose his.
420
The doctors arrive Sunday at noon.
421
Eudora Fletcher and Leonard Zelig ... welcome them and let them see their property.
422
Dr. Fletcher is tense and alarmed.
423
Leonard Zelig, however, seems calm and comfortable.
424
Despite being surrounded by doctors ... it does not turn into one of them.
425
The meeting seems to be a thrilling success ... until Dr. Henry Mayerson makes an innocent comment ... on time, saying it's a good day.
426
Zelig answers Dr Mayerson for not agreeing ... and that's not a good day.
427
Dr. Mayerson is surprised ... by the power of Zelig's conviction.
428
It points out that the sun shines and that the temperature is mild.
429
Zelig, accustomed to giving voice to his opinions without hesitation ... is too aggressive. It is too much conditioned in the opposite direction ... it has become stubborn about its views ... and it does not tolerate any divergence from its way of seeing.
430
I had pushed her too far in the opposite.
431
He struck Dr. Mayerson and other staff members ... with a rake.
432
It's not what we wanted ... yet I felt I got something.
433
If I had had it for another two weeks ... I would have perfected my techniques ... and let Leonard Zelig return himself.
434
Dr. Eudora Nesbit Fletcher, hero, indeed heroin, of the moment.
435
The beautiful, intelligent psychiatrist never doubted the fact ... that Leonard Zelig, the human chameleon, was suffering from mental illness.
436
Working with his cousin, filmmaker Paul Deghuee ... has recorded very important documentation ... which includes precious Zelig filming under hypnosis.
437
In the course of the care, the doctor and the patient have become friends ... and spend time together even outside the therapy.
438
The courage to uphold a minority opinion has led ... to a pompous success for psychiatry.
439
Who says that women are only brave to sew?
440
Let's go to the town hall where the heroes of the moment will receive the keys of the city.
441
We are honored to deliver you the keys to the city of New York.
442
Jimmy Walker wanted to be here with us ... and sing "Leonard the lizard" but was a bit too busy.
443
Then, Eudora Fletcher, the beautiful and ingenious doctor ... who healed Zelig from his enigmatic illness ... receives the honor of his fellow scientists at the Waldorf Astoria in New York.
444
There are luminaries all over the world, not just psychiatrists ... but also physicists, biologists, mathematicians and so on.
445
Here we see it discussing with Nils Andersen ... pioneer in the field of blood diseases.
446
He will then receive another recognition from the world's largest city ... when he will baptize his first ship.
447
A remarkable success for a country girl.
448
I'm talking to you from Mrs Catherine Fletcher's home ... Mother of Dr. Eudora Fletcher ... the famous psychiatrist who is on all newspapers.
449
I would like to ask Mrs. Fletcher ... first of all, to tell us what effect does a genius of medicine grow. And then I would like to talk about all the sacrifices made ... to fund his studies.
450
Please speak in the microphone, thank you.
451
We have not made any sacrifices. John was a stockbroker ... he had a lot of money, and I came from a wealthy Philadelphia family.
452
I'm sure his daughter has always wanted to be a doctor ... since she was a kid.
453
I would not say that.
454
I always thought she wanted to fly like her sister, and get a family ... - but she was a very grumpy little girl. - But surely every mother dreams ... that her little girl has the success of her daughter.
455
- It was a very difficult girl - Tell me about her husband ...
456
It turns out to be just a businessman.
457
Must be really excited ...
458
to see her daughter get similar awards ...
459
John had problems. Depression. And he drank.
460
Well, Mrs Fletcher, thank you very much for being with us today.
461
Here at San Simeon ... the fairy tales of print magnate William Randolph Hearst ... various famous people are tantalizing or tanning.
462
Here is Marie Dressler with Mr. Hearst. Always a very popular guest ...
463
Miss Dressler accepts a flower from an ardent admirer.
464
Along with her is Marion Davies.
465
When it comes to work, Miss Davies is always very serious ... but here, in this wonderful playground ... it demonstrates its spiritual side.
466
Here it is, with ... no less than Charlie Chaplin, always kidding.
467
Although New York is almost 5000 km away ...
468
Jimmy Walker looks like magic at Mr. Hearst's enchanted gate.
469
Another New Yorker is Leonard Zelig ... who is kidding with our favorite cowboy, Tom Mix.
470
Will not Tony be jealous of you?
471
Tony is Tom's horse, and we thought they were always together.
472
Here's the good Chaplin again this time with Adolphe Menjou.
473
Here's Claire Windsor and Dolores del Rio ... and a fascinating Eudora Fletcher ... who chats with Hollywood's latest star, James Cagney.
474
Oh, and who are we here?
475
A beautiful lady named Carole Lombard.
476
And down there we see Dr. Fletcher and Leonard Zelig ... who take a couple of strokes with Bobby Jones on Mr. Hearst's field.
477
Unless Leonard does not recover his chameleon personality ... and turns into a professional ... I'll bet my money on Bobby.
478
But what does it matter if they have fun?
479
Leonard, do you want to give some advice to the young people in this country?
480
Certainly. Guys, you have to be yourself. You can not imitate others ... just because you believe they have all the answers you are looking for.
481
You have to be yourself and learn to speak your voice aloud.
482
Perhaps in other countries can not be done, but this is America.
483
Believe me, because first I belonged to the reptile family ... but now no more.
484
Zelig, no longer a chameleon, is again himself.
485
His point of view on politics, art and love ... is sincere and sincere.
486
Although his tastes are described by many as mediocre ... they are his.
487
He is finally an individual, a human being.
488
He no longer abandons his identity ... to try to be a safe and invisible part of his environment.
489
His tastes were not so terrible.
490
It was the kind of person who preferred to watch baseball ... rather than reading "Moby Dick" ... and that was what made him a bad road ... at least, so does the legend.
491
It was more than a question of symbolism. For the Marxists, it represented a certain thing.
492
The Catholic Church never pardoned ... the Vatican accident.
493
The Americans ... with the Great Depression ... saw in him the symbol of the possibility ... of improvement, self-realization.
494
And of course, the Freudians looked at us ... they could interpret it as they wanted.
495
It was all symbolic, but there were not ... two intellectuals who agreed on the meaning.
496
I do not know if it can be called a triumph of psychotherapy. It is more than a triumph of aesthetic instincts. Dr. Fletcher's techniques had nothing ... at the therapy schools of then.
497
She knew what she needed and provided it. This was, in his own way, an extraordinary achievement.
498
If I think about it, it seems to me that his story ... reflects to a large extent the Jewish experience in America ... the great need to get wide, find his place ... and assimilate into culture.
499
He had a craving to assimilate.
500
Even Eudora Fletcher's life has changed ... from this experience.
501
For her, fame and recognition are reckless rewards ... and do not match the youth fantasies ... that have awakened her ambition.
502
She and her patient fell in love ... and it is no surprise to anyone that she leaves ... the ambitious lawyer Koslow ... and announces her wedding plans with Zelig.
503
It was great to see my sister and Leonard together.
504
He gave them strength ... and they were so in love ... and she seemed happier than she had been in so many years.
505
I remember that they decided to get married in the spring ... and then, of course ... it all ended up rolling.
506
Two weeks before the wedding ... an ex-souvenir named Lita Fox goes ahead ... and says she is married to Zelig.
507
He also says he had a son with him.
508
The scandal is immediate.
509
We got married a year ago. He told me he was an actor.
510
It seemed credible, and I'm also in the world of entertainment.
511
So we went to Baltimore and married ... and here I have the license that proves it.
512
He had married her under another personality.
513
When she read about her upcoming marriage with Eudora Fletcher ... she had been mortified and had decided to sue.
514
Zelig announces that he will fight in court ... but public opinion begins to turn his face.
515
Attractive lawyers paint Lita Fox as an abandoned woman.
516
The child is neglected, poor and without father.
517
Zelig has sold Hollywood's story to Hollywood ... for a large sum of money.
518
When the scandal bursts ... the studios ask for money back.
519
Zelig can only return half of it. The rest was spent.
520
Scandalized, the studios only give him half of his life. They keep the best moments ... and only the hours of sleep and meals remain.
521
Zelig is shaken by scandal, but this is just the beginning.
522
Now another woman comes forward: Helen Gray, a commissar at a Winsconsin souvenir shop ... says Zelig is the father of his two twins.
523
She says to lawyers who had come up as a furry hunter.
524
Zelig does not remember, but admits ... that may have happened during one of his metamorphoses.
525
It is the drop that overflows the vessel.
526
He married me in the Harlem church.
527
He told me to be Duke Ellington's brother.
528
It's the guy who has driven me off the car. It was brand new.
529
Then he put the back and passed on my mother's wrist.
530
It's old and uses a lot of wrist.
531
He painted the house of an obscene color. He said he was a painter. When I saw the result I did not believe in my eyes. Then he disappeared.
532
What Zelig is responsible for ... the behaviors of each of the personalities he has taken ... means for him only one thing: dozens of complaints.
533
He is sued for bigotry, adultery ... car accidents, plagiarism, domestic accidents ... negligence, property damage, property damage ... and for performing unnecessary extraction of teeth.
534
I would like to apologize to everyone.
535
I'm terribly sorry to have married all those women.
536
It's just ... I do not know, I thought it was the right thing.
537
And to the lord to whom I removed the appendage ... no ... I do not know what to say.
538
If it can comfort her, I still have her home somewhere.
539
My deeper apologies go to the Trokman family in Detroit.
540
I never gave birth to a baby ... and I thought the ice pincers were the right tool.
541
By leveraging on mercy and legal technical skills ... American attorneys have their time of glory.
542
Zelig is branded as a criminal. Despite Dr. Fletcher's insistence that Zelig can not ... be held responsible for his actions in his chameleon state ... it's all worthless.
543
Leonard Zelig is a bad example for the nation's morale. America is a morally right country. God's Timorate.
544
We do not forgive scandals ... scandals of fraud and polygamy.
545
In the name of the principles of a pure society ... I say, we lick that miserable Jew!
546
During this humiliating trial ... Eudora Fletcher stands bravely beside the man she loves.
547
In private, trusts friends ... to be worried about Zelig's emotional conditions ... that seem to deteriorate ... under the weight of common morals.
548
In public, Zelig tries to prove master of himself ... but it is getting harder.
549
It is clear that he is going to pieces ... when he and Eudora dine in a Greek restaurant and ... mid-dinner, Zelig begins to turn into a Greek.
550
Desperately desires to be again welcome ... accepted, inserted.
551
The clamor of the public on her morality reaches paroxysm ... and on the eve of the sentence ... Leonard Zelig disappears.
552
Chief Inspector Thomas Dowd speaks ... in a nationwide press release.
553
Leonard Zelig has disappeared. On the eve of his sentence ... for a set of crimes and misdeeds ... ranging from polygamy to fraud, he was stained.
554
We are looking for clues and we would appreciate the contribution of anyone ... have information that can lead to his capture.
555
My sister was literally torn apart.
556
He was trying to keep calm ... but he was just ... shocked.
557
And it was not even the kind of person ... who usually shows his feelings ... except for what Leonard meant.
558
Dr Fletcher and the police are in daily contact. By common accord, they make public calls ... to anyone who can provide some news.
559
Apart from some absurd calls ... they do not get anything.
560
The months pass and Zelig has no trace.
561
Cars are searched. False clues raining from everywhere.
562
His jacket is found in Texas ... where a hunting man turns out to be useless.
563
They say they saw him in Chicago, California.
564
In this photo of a Marian music group in Mexico ... there is a man who seems to resemble him.
565
Dr. Fletcher continues to look for Zelig ... but hope fades away every day more.
566
I could only think about Leonard ... to what I missed and how much I loved her ... and to all the wonderful moments she had spent together.
567
These days were really painful for me.
568
The year ends and Zelig is still unavailable.
569
I was just dragging me here and there and crying.
570
And one evening after a particularly bad time ... my sister Meryl told me ... "Come on, we go out for dinner or a concert" ... I said, "No, I can not do it" but she insisted.
571
We got out and finally we went to see a movie.
572
We saw "Grand Hotel" and there was also a news event.
573
Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist Party ... gain ground in a Berlin hit by depression.
574
Denouncing the Treaty of Versailles ... the Nazis leverage German patriotism.
575
Eudora Fletcher remains silent.
576
In the midst of the Nazis ... he sees a person who might be Zelig.
577
In fact, the thing was meaningful ... because although he wanted to be loved ... he wanted to be loved ... there was something in him ... that he wanted to disappear in the mass, in the general anonymity. And fascism offers Zelig this kind of possibilities ... so that he can make himself anonymous ... belonging to this vast mass movement.
578
The doctor embarks for Europe the following week ... and ten days after arriving in Berlin.
579
Germany is a country in deep economic crisis.
580
They breathe militarism and anxiety.
581
She searches everywhere and asks for information ... but there is nothing to do.
582
After three weeks ... the authorities begin to feel suspicious.
583
They keep an eye on her. As he is out, he searches for his hotel room.
584
You spend a fourth week ... and she is about to give up and go home ... when the news of a big comedy in Munich hits her attention.
585
It is said to be ... the biggest gathering of Nazis ever happened.
586
Eudora Fletcher counts on hope ... that Zelig takes part and that, meeting her, the strong feelings ... she has always felt for her to be awakened.
587
At first, there does not seem to be hope. The crowd is immense. It seems impossible to be able to isolate a single face. Then suddenly a figure beside the Chancellor ... draws his attention.
588
Behind Hitler, on the right, recognizes Zelig.
589
Striving to establish a contact, he tries to cross his gaze.
590
Like a man awakening from a dream, Zelig notes.
591
In a flash, he comes back to himself.
592
It was not like the movie.
593
When Leonard got off the podium, they did not know what to think.
594
We did not believe in our eyes. Hitler's speech was ruined.
595
He wanted to make a joke about Poland ... but right then Zelig intrigued ... and Hitler was extremely upset.
596
The SS wanted to capture Zelig ... and if they took it ... they would probably have tortured him ... or maybe even killed.
597
So in general confusion ... Dr. Fletcher and Zelig left the building ... from a side door.
598
They took a car and they escaped ... and the SS, behind, fired.
599
In a rare German news story ... we can see some images of the escape.
600
I was flying a plane. It was wonderful. And then, suddenly, something happened. I was scared and lost control. We were rushing.
601
Leonard was so terrified that he changed his personality ... and since I was a pilot at that time ... he also turned him into a pilot.
602
Zelig takes control of the plane. By interpreting the role of a pilot ... Zelig struggles boldly to control the device.
603
The Germans, astonished, take us a quarter of an hour ... before arranging for a chase.
604
While Eudora Fletcher is senseless ... Zelig, who has never driven a plane in his life ... not only manages to escape the German pilots ... but also establishes a record, crossing the Atlantic without a stop .. . upside down.
605
New York celebrates Eudora Fletcher ... and Leonard Zelig, the human chameleon.
606
His incredible flight fills the country with pride ... and guarantees the presidential amnesty.
607
The crowds flock to see him next to her courageous bride promise.
608
Their triumphal journey ends at the City Hall.
609
New York City's Value Medal ... is conferred on Zelig by Carter Dean.
610
You are a great inspiration for the young people of this country ... who will grow one day and will be great doctors and large patients.
611
It's a big emotion.
612
I'm glad we've been alive here.
613
I had never done it before. It shows you what you can do ... if you're completely psychotic.
614
The thing is paradoxical ... because what had allowed him to accomplish this incredible enterprise ... was precisely his ability to transform.
615
So his illness was also the basis of his salvation ... and I find it interesting to see her in this perspective. It was his disturbance to make him a hero.
616
In a way it was really absurd.
617
I mean, he had this curious gift ... this strange feature. And for a while they all loved him ... then, people got tired of him. At that point he did that business with the plane ... and again everyone wanted to. The 1920s were basically the same.
618
And, if you think so well, has it changed so much, America? I do not think so.
619
After getting rid of infinite legal details ...
620
Leonard Zelig and Eudora Fletcher marry.
621
It's a simple ceremony, shot in amateur movies.
622
"Just wanting to do it well, transformed itself ..." beyond any measure, "Scott Fitzgerald wrote.
623
"You wonder what would happen if, from the beginning ..." he had the courage to express himself instead of pretending.
624
"After all, it was not the approval of the masses ..." but the love of a woman, what changed her life "
625
