<seg id="1"> ﻿He was the phenomenon of the '20s. </seg>
<seg id="2"> When you think, at the time, he was as well-known as Lindbergh, it's really quite astonishing. </seg>
<seg id="3"> His story reflected the nature of our civilization, the character of our times, yet it was also one man's story. And all the themes of our culture were there. Heroism, will, things like that. </seg>
<seg id="4"> But when you look back on it, it was very strange. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Well, it is ironic to see how quickly he has faded from memory, considering what an astounding record he made. </seg>
<seg id="6"> He was, of course, very amusing, but at the same time touched a nerve in people, perhaps in a way in which they would prefer not to be touched. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It certainly is a very bizarre story. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The year is 1928. </seg>
<seg id="9"> America, enjoying a decade of unequalled prosperity, has gone wild. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The Jazz Age, it is called. The rhythms are syncopated, the morals are looser, the liquor is cheaper, when you can get it. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It is a time of diverse heroes and madcap stunts, of speakeasies and flamboyant parties. </seg>
<seg id="12"> One typical party occurs at the Long Island estate </seg>
<seg id="13"> of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Porter Sutton, socialites, patrons of the arts. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Politicians and poets rub elbows with the cream of high society. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Present at the party is Scott Fitzgerald, who is to cast perspective on the '20s for all future generations. </seg>
<seg id="16"> He writes in his notebook about a curious little man named Leon Selwyn or Zelman, who seemed clearly to be an aristocrat, and extolled the very rich as he chatted with socialites. </seg>
<seg id="17"> He spoke adoringly of Coolidge and the Republican party, all in an upper-class Boston accent. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "An hour later," writes Fitzgerald, "I was stunned to see the same man speaking with the kitchen help." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "Now, he claimed to be a Democrat and his accent seemed to be coarse, "as if he were one of the crowd." It is the first small notice taken of Leonard Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Florida, one year later. </seg>
<seg id="21"> An odd incident occurs at the New York Yankees' training camp. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Journalists, anxious as always to immortalize the exploits of the great home-run hitters, notice a strange new player waiting his turn at bat after Babe Ruth. </seg>
<seg id="23"> He is listed on the roster as Lou Zelig, but no one on the team has heard of him. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Security guards are called, and he is escorted from the premises. </seg>
<seg id="25"> It appears as a small item in the next day's newspaper. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Chicago, Illinois, that same year. </seg>
<seg id="27"> There is a private party at a speakeasy on the South Side. </seg>
<seg id="28"> People from the most respectable walks of life dance and drink bathtub gin. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Present that evening was Calvin Turner, a waiter. </seg>
<seg id="30"> A lotta customers, a lotta gangsters came in the place. </seg>
<seg id="31"> 'Cause they always good tippers and take good care of us, and of course we try to take care of our customers. </seg>
<seg id="32"> But on this particular night, I looked over and here's a strange guy comin' in. I'd never seen him before, so I asked one of the others, I say, </seg>
<seg id="33"> "John, you know this guy? You ever seen him?" So he looks. "No, I ain't never seen him before." </seg>
<seg id="34"> "I don't know who he is, but I know he's a tough-looking hombre." </seg>
<seg id="35"> So I looked over, and next thing, the guy had disappeared. </seg>
<seg id="36"> I don't know where he went to, but about this time, the music usually gets started. and I looked, and here's a colored guy, a colored boy playin' trumpet. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Man, he was playin' back. I looked at the guy and said "Well, my goodness. "He looks just like that gangster, but the gangster was white "and this guy is black." So I don't know what's... What's happening. </seg>
<seg id="38"> New York City. It is several months later. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Police are investigating the disappearance of a clerk named Leonard Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Both his landlady and his employer have reported him missing. </seg>
<seg id="41"> They tell police he was an odd little man who kept to himself. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Only two clues are found in Zelig's Greenwich Village flat. </seg>
<seg id="43"> One, a photograph of Zelig with Eugene O'Neill, and one of him as Pagliacci. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Acting on a tip, they trace his whereabouts to Chinatown, where, in the rear of a Chinese establishment, a strange-looking Oriental who fits the description of Leonard Zelig is discovered. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Suspicious, the detectives try to pull off his disguise, but it is not a disguise, and a fight breaks out. </seg>
<seg id="46"> He is removed by force, and taken to Manhattan Hospital. </seg>
<seg id="47"> In the ambulance, he rants and curses in what sounds like authentic Chinese. </seg>
<seg id="48"> He is restrained with a straitjacket. </seg>
<seg id="49"> When he emerges from the car incredibly, he is no longer Chinese, but Caucasian. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Bewildered interns place him in the emergency room for observation. </seg>
<seg id="51"> At 7:00 a.m., Dr. Eudora Fletcher, a psychiatrist, makes her usual rounds. </seg>
<seg id="52"> When I first heard about this emergency case that had been brought in, I didn't think anything peculiar. And when I first laid eyes on him, it was a bit strange, because I mistook him for a doctor. </seg>
<seg id="53"> He had a very professional demeanor about him. </seg>
<seg id="54"> As a young psychiatrist, Eudora Fletcher is fascinated by Leonard Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="55"> She convinces the conservative staff at the hospital to allow her to pursue a study of the new admission. </seg>
<seg id="56"> - What do you do? - Oh, me? I'm a psychiatrist. </seg>
<seg id="57"> - Oh, yes? - Yes, yes, I work mostly with delusional paranoids. </seg>
<seg id="58"> - Tell me about it. - Oh, there's not much to tell. I... </seg>
<seg id="59"> I work mostly on the Continent, and I've written quite a few psychoanalytic papers. </seg>
<seg id="60"> I've studied a great deal. I worked with Freud in Vienna. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Yes, we broke over the concept of penis envy. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Freud felt that it should be limited to women. </seg>
<seg id="63"> FLETCHER: It's not that he was making any sense at all. </seg>
<seg id="64"> It was just a conglomeration of psychological double-talk </seg>
<seg id="65"> that he had apparently heard, or perhaps was familiar with through reading. </seg>
<seg id="66"> The funny thing was that his delivery was quite fluid, and might have been really quite convincing to someone who did not know any better. </seg>
<seg id="67"> Who was this Leonard Zelig that seemed to create such diverse impressions everywhere? </seg>
<seg id="68"> All that was known of him was that he was the son of a Yiddish actor named Morris Zelig, whose performance as Puck in the Orthodox version of A Midsummer Night's Dream, was coolly received. </seg>
<seg id="69"> The elder Zelig's second marriage is marked by constant violent quarrelling, so much so, that although the family lives over a bowling alley, it is the bowling alley that complains of noise. </seg>
<seg id="70"> As a boy, Leonard is frequently bullied by anti-Semites. </seg>
<seg id="71"> His parents, who never take his part and blame him for everything, side with the anti-Semites. </seg>
<seg id="72"> They punish him often by locking him in a dark closet. </seg>
<seg id="73"> When they are really angry, they get into the closet with him. </seg>
<seg id="74"> On his deathbed, Morris Zelig tells his son that life is a meaningless nightmare of suffering, and the only advice he gives him is to save string. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Though brother Jack has a nervous breakdown, and sister Ruth becomes a shoplifter and alcoholic, Leonard Zelig appears to have adjusted to life. </seg>
<seg id="76"> Somehow, he seems to have coped. </seg>
<seg id="77"> And then, suddenly, increasingly strange behavior. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Fascinated by the Zelig phenomenon, Dr. Fletcher arranges a series of experiments and invites the skeptical staff to observe. </seg>
<seg id="79"> With the doctors watching, Zelig becomes a perfect psychiatrist. </seg>
<seg id="80"> When two Frenchmen are brought in, Zelig assumes their characters and speaks reasonable French. </seg>
<seg id="81"> In the company of a Chinese person, he begins to develop oriental features. </seg>
<seg id="82"> By now, word has gotten out to the press, and a public thirsting for thrills and novelty is immediately captivated. </seg>
<seg id="83"> The clamor is so great that Dr. Allan Sindell is forced to issue a statement. </seg>
<seg id="84"> We're just beginning to realize the dimensions of what could be the scientific medical phenomenon of the age, and possibly of all time. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Fresh stories roll off the press every day about Zelig and his puzzling condition. </seg>
<seg id="86"> Although the doctors claim to have the situation in hand, no two can agree on a diagnosis. </seg>
<seg id="87"> I'm convinced that it's glandular in nature and although there's no evidence now of any misfunction, I'm sure that further tests will show a problem in the secretions. </seg>
<seg id="88"> I'm certain it's something he picked up from eating Mexican food. </seg>
<seg id="89"> This manifestation is neurological in origin. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Now, this patient is suffering from a brain tumor, and I should not be surprised if, within several weeks, he died. </seg>
<seg id="91"> Now, we have not as yet been able to locate the tumor, but we're still looking. </seg>
<seg id="92"> Ironically, within two weeks' time, it is Dr. Birsky himself who dies of a brain tumor. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Leonard Zelig is fine. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Throughout the weeks of testing and speculation, Eudora Fletcher begins to feel that the patient might be suffering not from a physiological disorder, but from a psychological one. </seg>
<seg id="95"> It is Zelig's unstable make-up, she suggests, that accounts for his metamorphoses. </seg>
<seg id="96"> The governing board of doctors is hostile to her notion. </seg>
<seg id="97"> They conclude that Zelig's malady can be traced to poor alignment of the vertebrae. </seg>
<seg id="98"> Tests prove them wrong, and cause a temporary problem for the patient. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Now, the press and public hang on every bit of news, thoroughly absorbed in the real-life drama. </seg>
<seg id="100"> The continuing saga of the strange creature at Manhattan Hospital goes on. </seg>
<seg id="101"> This morning, doctors report, experiments were conducted and several women of varying types were placed in close proximity to the subject, but no change occurred, leading authorities to conclude that the phenomenon does not occur with women. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Later today, doctors will be experimenting with a midget and a chicken. </seg>
<seg id="103"> Leonard Zelig continues to astound scientists at New York's Manhattan Hospital, where numerous tests have led nowhere in determining the nature of this astonishing manifestation. </seg>
<seg id="104"> He is confronted by two overweight men at the request of the doctors. </seg>
<seg id="105"> As the men discuss their obesity, an initially reticent Zelig joins in, swelling himself to a miraculous 250 pounds. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Next, in the presence of two Negro men, </seg>
<seg id="107"> Zelig rapidly becomes one himself. </seg>
<seg id="108"> What will they think of next? </seg>
<seg id="109"> Meanwhile, Americans all over have their own reactions. </seg>
<seg id="110"> I wish I could be Lenny Zelig, the changing man. </seg>
<seg id="111"> I'd be different people, and maybe someday my wishes will come true. </seg>
<seg id="112"> Leonard Zelig is one of the finest gentlemen in the United States of America! </seg>
<seg id="113"> He is the cat's pajamas! </seg>
<seg id="114"> Tell me why you assume the characteristics of the person you're with. </seg>
<seg id="115"> It's safe. </seg>
<seg id="116"> What do you mean? What do you mean, "safe"? </seg>
<seg id="117"> Safe to... To be like the others. </seg>
<seg id="118"> You want to be safe? </seg>
<seg id="119"> I wanna be liked. </seg>
<seg id="120"> Probing Zelig's unconscious, Dr. Fletcher gradually puts together the pieces of Zelig's behavioral puzzle. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Dividing her time between the hospital and the 42nd Street library, she writes her report. </seg>
<seg id="122"> A closed meeting of doctors listens as Dr. Fletcher describes Zelig as "a human chameleon." </seg>
<seg id="123"> Like the lizard that is endowed by nature with a marvelous protective device that enables it to change color and blend in with its immediate surrounding, Zelig, too, protects himself by becoming whoever he is around. </seg>
<seg id="124"> The doctors listen, and their reaction is skeptical. </seg>
<seg id="125"> "Impossible!" they claim."Preposterous!" </seg>
<seg id="126"> "If he's a lizard," quips one doctor, "then we should not spend good hospital money feeding him, "but simply catch him some flies." </seg>
<seg id="127"> We knew we had a good story this time 'cause it had everything in it. It had romance and it had suspense. </seg>
<seg id="128"> And then this fella, Zelig, you know, he grew up poor. </seg>
<seg id="129"> I remember my city editor came to me. He said "Ted, we want this story on page one every day." </seg>
<seg id="130"> And in those days, you'd do anything to sell papers. </seg>
<seg id="131"> To get a story, you'd jazz it up, exaggerate, even maybe play with the truth a little bit. </seg>
<seg id="132"> But here was a story. It was a natural. </seg>
<seg id="133"> You just told the truth and it sold papers. It never happened before. </seg>
<seg id="134"> Overnight, Leonard Zelig has become the main topic of conversation everywhere, and is discussed with amusement and wonder. </seg>
<seg id="135"> No social gathering is without its Leonard Zelig joke, and in a decade of popular dance crazes, a new one sweeps the nation. </seg>
<seg id="136"> What's brown and white and yellow and has four eyes? </seg>
<seg id="137"> Leonard Zelig at the League of Nations. </seg>
<seg id="138"> NARRATOR: Not everyone, however, was entranced by the human chameleon, and amongst the fanatics, he was a handy symbol of iniquity. </seg>
<seg id="139"> This creature personifies capitalist man! </seg>
<seg id="140"> A creature who takes many forms to achieve ends, the exploitation of the workers by deception. </seg>
<seg id="141"> To the Ku Klux Klan, Zelig, a Jew who was able to transform himself into a Negro or Indian, was a triple threat. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Meanwhile, Dr. Fletcher, certain that her findings are correct, begs for time with her patient to put her theories into operation. </seg>
<seg id="143"> Do you recall the first time you began behaving like the people you were around? </seg>
<seg id="144"> In school, some very bright people asked me if I read Moby Dick. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Yes? I was ashamed to say I never read it. </seg>
<seg id="146"> - And you pretended? - Yes. </seg>
<seg id="147"> When did the changes begin happening automatically? </seg>
<seg id="148"> Years ago. St. Patrick's Day. </seg>
<seg id="149"> Wandered into a bar. Wasn't wearing green. </seg>
<seg id="150"> They made remarks. I turned Irish. </seg>
<seg id="151"> You told them you were Irish? </seg>
<seg id="152"> My hair turned red, my nose turned up. </seg>
<seg id="153"> Spoke about the great potato famine and the little people. </seg>
<seg id="154"> We do not agree with Dr. Fletcher's ideas. </seg>
<seg id="155"> We believe those ideas are pipe dreams. </seg>
<seg id="156"> We believe that any change in Zelig's condition is going to be brought about through certain experimental drugs, which, although risky, have been known to work wonders. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Zelig is treated with the experimental drug Somadril hydrate. </seg>
<seg id="158"> He undergoes severe mood changes, and for several days will not come off the wall. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Then, suddenly, as Dr. Fletcher is beginning to make some progress, the question of Zelig's fate takes a new twist as his half-sister, Ruth, shocks everyone by removing him from the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="160"> He can be better cared for at home, she tells the doctors. </seg>
<seg id="161"> He will be looked after, she explains, by her and her dubious-looking lover, Martin Geist, a businessman and ex-carnival promoter. </seg>
<seg id="162"> There is very little resistance amongst the doctors, who are relieved to be rid of the frustrating case. </seg>
<seg id="163"> Only Dr. Fletcher cares about Zelig as a human being. </seg>
<seg id="164"> She insists he desperately needs special care, but it is to no avail. </seg>
<seg id="165"> No, no one was questioning her legal right to Zelig, </seg>
<seg id="166"> I mean, she was his half-sister and his guardian, but she had a strange boyfriend called Geist </seg>
<seg id="167"> that... He'd been in jail for real-estate fraud. </seg>
<seg id="168"> He was selling the same piece of property to a lot of the same people, and... </seg>
<seg id="169"> Matter of fact, a congressman from Delaware bought it twice. </seg>
<seg id="170"> NARRATOR: The crowds that lined the roads to glimpse the human chameleon tie up traffic for days. </seg>
<seg id="171"> He is a sight to behold for tourists and children. </seg>
<seg id="172"> People from all over the country fight for space to peek at this new wonderment. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Selling mementos while her brother is allowed to be on exhibition is only the beginning for Ruth Zelig and Martin Geist. </seg>
<seg id="174"> Admission is charged to twice-daily demonstrations of Leonard's stunning prowess. </seg>
<seg id="175"> He does not disappoint, changing appearance over and over upon demand. </seg>
<seg id="176"> Overnight, he has become an attraction, a novelty, a freak. </seg>
<seg id="177"> In this 1935 film based on the life of Zelig, called The Changing Man, the atmosphere is best summed up. </seg>
<seg id="178"> We can't give up custody of Leonard. I know if I'm given the chance, I can cure him. </seg>
<seg id="179"> It's no use. Even our attorney says it's hopeless. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Really, Dr. Fletcher. Uh... May I call you Eudora? </seg>
<seg id="181"> I tell you, somewhere behind that vacuous face, that zombie-like stare, </seg>
<seg id="182"> is a real human being, and I can bring it out. </seg>
<seg id="183"> - How? - I'll think up some new way. </seg>
<seg id="184"> Some technique. Whatever it is, it'll have to be personal. </seg>
<seg id="185"> There's not much I can do legally. I'll try, but... </seg>
<seg id="186"> They don't care about him. They'll exploit him. </seg>
<seg id="187"> All they see in him is a chance to make more money. Look at this. </seg>
<seg id="188"> Already they're selling this Leonard Zelig doll. </seg>
<seg id="189"> The film did not exaggerate. There were not only Leonard Zelig pens and lucky charms, but clocks and toys. There were Leonard Zelig watches and books, and a famous Leonard Zelig doll. </seg>
<seg id="190"> There were aprons, chameleon-shaped earmuffs and a popular Leonard Zelig game. </seg>
<seg id="191"> There were many popular songs inspired by Leonard Zelig, tunes that swept the nation. </seg>
<seg id="192"> In addition to the products and endorsements, there are the endless exhibitions. </seg>
<seg id="193"> In Hollywood, he is a great favorite and is offered a film contract. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Clara Bow invites him for a private weekend, and tells him to bring all his personalities. </seg>
<seg id="195"> In Chicago, he meets heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey, who clowns with Zelig at his training camp. </seg>
<seg id="196"> In Washington, DC, he is introduced to both Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover. </seg>
<seg id="197"> In France he is hailed as "Le Lézard." He is the toast of the Parisian music halls. </seg>
<seg id="198"> His performance endears him as well to many leading French intellectuals, who see in him a symbol for everything. </seg>
<seg id="199"> His transformation into a rabbi is so realistic that certain Frenchmen suggest he be sent to Devil's Island. </seg>
<seg id="200"> At the Folies-Bergère, Josephine Baker does her version of the Chameleon dance, and later tells friends she finds Zelig amazing, but a little lost. </seg>
<seg id="201"> Everyone used to be at my place, that is, everyone who was someone. And occasionally, someone would bring Zelig in... Leonard in. </seg>
<seg id="202"> Cole Porter was fascinated by Leonard, and he once wrote a line in a song... </seg>
<seg id="203"> Uh..."You're the tops, you're Leonard Zelig." But then he couldn't find anything to rhyme with "Zelig." </seg>
<seg id="204"> I'm flyin' high 'Cause I've got a feelin' I'm fallin' Fallin' for nobody else but you </seg>
<seg id="205"> You caught my eye Now I got a feelin' I'm fallin' </seg>
<seg id="206"> Show me that ring and I'll jump right through </seg>
<seg id="207"> I used to travel single, oh We chanced to mingle, oh Now I'm a-tingle over you </seg>
<seg id="208"> Hey, Mr. Zelig, stand by 'Cause I've got a feelin' I'm fallin' Fallin' for nobody else but you, wow! </seg>
<seg id="209"> Though the shows and parties keep Zelig's sister and her lover rich and amused, Zelig's own existence is a nonexistence. </seg>
<seg id="210"> Devoid of personality, his human qualities long since lost in the shuffle of life, he sits alone, quietly staring into space, a cipher, a non-person, a performing freak. </seg>
<seg id="211"> He who wanted only to fit in, to belong, to go unseen by his enemies and be loved, neither fits in nor belongs, is supervised by enemies, and remains uncared for. </seg>
<seg id="212"> The board at the hospital has all but forgotten Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="213"> Only Dr. Fletcher continues to fight for his custody. </seg>
<seg id="214"> The court turns her final appeal down. </seg>
<seg id="215"> Throughout her valiant legal battle, she is frequently in the company of her attorney, Charles Koslow. </seg>
<seg id="216"> He falls in love with her and presses for her hand in marriage. </seg>
<seg id="217"> She is ambivalent. </seg>
<seg id="218"> Reluctantly, she is beginning to abandon all hope of recovering Leonard Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="219"> That summer, Geist has booked them in Spain. </seg>
<seg id="220"> It is the last leg of a European tour that has been wildly successful. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Relations between Martin Geist and Ruth Zelig have grown strained. </seg>
<seg id="222"> They have become bored with one another, and quarrel frequently. </seg>
<seg id="223"> The situation grows worse when she meets Luis Martinez, a mediocre and cowardly bullfighter with whom she falls in love. </seg>
<seg id="224"> Though he wishes to impress Ruth Zelig, </seg>
<seg id="225"> Martinez displays his usual panic in the arena. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Good fortune is with him, however, as the bull gives himself a brain concussion. </seg>
<seg id="227"> Martinez takes credit for the kill, and, cutting off the bull's ear, presents it to his lover with great bravado. </seg>
<seg id="228"> That evening, in a jealous rage, Martin Geist returns to his hotel room and confronts Ruth Zelig. He demands that she give him the ear. </seg>
<seg id="229"> She refuses. Geist insists upon possession of the ear. </seg>
<seg id="230"> They quarrel furiously, and Martinez is discovered hiding in the closet. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Geist pulls a revolver and shoots him. </seg>
<seg id="232"> He turns the gun on Zelig's half-sister and kills her, then he takes his own life. In an orgy of jealous violence, Leonard Zelig's life is turned upside down. </seg>
<seg id="233"> At first, the news reverberates around the world. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Then, just as quickly, the thrill-hungry public becomes apathetic. </seg>
<seg id="235"> Fresh scandals appear and make headlines. </seg>
<seg id="236"> Events in the Jazz Age move too rapidly, like Red Grange. </seg>
<seg id="237"> A population glutted with distractions is quick to forget. </seg>
<seg id="238"> The '20s come to a crashing climax, and still Leonard Zelig is nowhere to be found. </seg>
<seg id="239"> Dr. Eudora Fletcher searches in vain to locate him. When several leads prove disappointing, she gives up, discouraged. </seg>
<seg id="240"> I felt it was a shame, because here was this unique case that I could make my reputation on. </seg>
<seg id="241"> Not that I knew how to cure him, but if I could have him alone and feel my way and be innovative and creative, I felt that I could change his life, if I only had the chance. </seg>
<seg id="243"> Borne on the shoulders of 12 attendants, </seg>
<seg id="244"> the seat of the gestatoria carrying the Holy Father is drawn out to the central balcony, where he bestows his blessing on Rome and all the world. </seg>
<seg id="245"> This is the first time that this ritual has been performed in 63 years, and brings to a climax on Easter Sunday the religious ceremonies of Holy Week. </seg>
<seg id="246"> Oh, but what's this? A commotion next to the Papal Father? </seg>
<seg id="247"> Somebody doesn't belong up there. </seg>
<seg id="248"> The guards are summoned amidst chaos, as His Holiness Pope Pius XI tries to swat the intruder with a sacred decree. </seg>
<seg id="249"> The faithful can't believe it. </seg>
<seg id="250"> It is, of course, Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="251"> He is returned to the United States by Italian authorities and readmitted to Manhattan Hospital. </seg>
<seg id="252"> "I welcome this opportunity to treat Leonard Zelig, "now that he's back as a ward of the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="253"> "I'm grateful that the board has given me this chance. </seg>
<seg id="254"> "I sincerely hope to return him to society a useful, self-possessed citizen "no longer a curiosity with no life of his own." </seg>
<seg id="255"> Dr. Fletcher has no time now to think of marriage. All her attention must be devoted to Leonard Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="256"> Her plan is to bring him to her country home. </seg>
<seg id="257"> She will set up a neutral environment away from society. </seg>
<seg id="258"> Here, she will begin searching for some new way to treat him in the hopes of penetrating his unique malady. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Aware of the significance of her work, </seg>
<seg id="260"> Eudora Fletcher arranges to keep a filmed record of the proceedings. </seg>
<seg id="261"> For this, she contacts her first cousin, Paul Deghuee, an inventor and part-time photographer. </seg>
<seg id="262"> And she said "I want to make a record of this case for future generations "and the world of science, </seg>
<seg id="263"> "and I want you to keep the camera very quiet." </seg>
<seg id="264"> And I said, "Why don't you just take notes and write it up?" </seg>
<seg id="265"> She said, "Paul, when a man changes his physical appearance, you want to see it. </seg>
<seg id="266"> "You can't read about it. Besides which, I am planning to make history." </seg>
<seg id="267"> The "White Room" is carefully arranged for maximum serenity. </seg>
<seg id="268"> It is a small study in Dr. Fletcher's house, sparsely furnished. </seg>
<seg id="269"> Clumsy photographic lights are nailed to the wall to provide sufficient illumination. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Microphones are hidden in specially selected places. </seg>
<seg id="271"> The camera shoots through a pane of glass which renders it relatively unobtrusive. </seg>
<seg id="272"> Only the noise of the motor is a problem, but this is muffled with a blanket and anything else handy. </seg>
<seg id="273"> From this cramped vantage point, photographer Paul Deghuee will record the famous "White Room Sessions, " a remarkable document in the history of psychotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="274"> By today's standards, the White Room Sessions would seem very primitive, and yet they were really quite effective in developing a very strong personal relation between doctor and patient. </seg>
<seg id="275"> The question whether Zelig was a psychotic or merely extremely neurotic was a question that was endlessly discussed among us doctors. </seg>
<seg id="276"> Now, I myself felt that, uh... His feelings were really not all that different from the normal, maybe what one would call the well-adjusted, normal person, only carried to an extreme degree, to an extreme extent. </seg>
<seg id="277"> I myself felt that one could really think of him as the ultimate conformist. </seg>
<seg id="278"> Leonard, do you know why you're here? </seg>
<seg id="279"> To discuss psychiatry, right? </seg>
<seg id="280"> You're a doctor? </seg>
<seg id="281"> Yes, I am. I am. Perhaps you've read my latest paper on delusional paranoia? </seg>
<seg id="282"> Turns out the entire thing is mental. </seg>
<seg id="283"> Now, suppose I tell you you're not a doctor. </seg>
<seg id="284"> Well, uh... I would say that you're making a joke. </seg>
<seg id="285"> Is it always so bright in here? </seg>
<seg id="286"> Oh, I'm recording these sessions on film, if you don't mind? </seg>
<seg id="287"> - No. Somebody's behind there, right? - Mmm-hmm. That's right. </seg>
<seg id="288"> - That's a camera. </seg>
<seg id="289"> Leonard... Leonard, why don't we start with simple reality? </seg>
<seg id="290"> - Leonard, you're not a doctor. - No? </seg>
<seg id="291"> No. You're a patient. I'm the doctor. </seg>
<seg id="292"> Well, I wouldn't tell that to too many people if I were you. </seg>
<seg id="293"> Leonard, you're not a doctor. </seg>
<seg id="294"> Is she gonna be all right? 'Cause... Is this a... </seg>
<seg id="295"> I've gotta get back to town. Really. I have an interesting case, treating two sets of Siamese twins with split personalities. I'm getting paid by eight people. </seg>
<seg id="296"> "The first week's sessions did not go too well, " writes Dr. Fletcher in her diary. </seg>
<seg id="297"> "Leonard identifies with me and is convinced that he is a doctor. </seg>
<seg id="298"> "He is guarded and suspicious. </seg>
<seg id="299"> "There is something appealing about him, too. He's quick-witted and energetic. </seg>
<seg id="300"> "Perhaps it is his very helplessness that moves me. </seg>
<seg id="301"> "I must keep flexible and play the situation by ear." </seg>
<seg id="302"> How are you today, Leonard? </seg>
<seg id="303"> Fine. And I... Uh... I gotta get back to town soon. You know, </seg>
<seg id="304"> I teach a course at the psychiatric institute in masturbation and... </seg>
<seg id="305"> - I see. - I'm a doctor, you know, and I... "Guilt-related masturbation." No, no, not guilt-related. I... I teach advanced. </seg>
<seg id="306"> - I'm quite a respected doctor there. - Leonard, I'd like you... ...eyes follow this pen and just let yourself breathe deeply. </seg>
<seg id="307"> - Why? What... - Relax. </seg>
<seg id="308"> No. You're trying to hypnotize me, obviously. </seg>
<seg id="309"> - Do you mind? - Of course I mind. I'm a doctor. I'm... </seg>
<seg id="310"> - Leonard, you're not a doctor. - I am a doctor! </seg>
<seg id="311"> - Just relax. - No, I can't. I'm... I'm due back in town. </seg>
<seg id="312"> I... I have this masturbation class. </seg>
<seg id="313"> If I'm not there, they start without me. </seg>
<seg id="314"> As the weeks go by, Dr. Fletcher grows more and more frustrated. </seg>
<seg id="315"> "Leonard continues to insist he is a doctor, "and even refuses to let me hypnotize him," she writes. </seg>
<seg id="316"> "I believe his experiences of the past year "have made him more defensive than ever. It is discouraging." </seg>
<seg id="317"> She was under great pressure, you could tell. She was moody and nervous. He was fine. Napping, sitting in his chair reading... He used to refer to himself as Dr. Zelig. He was reading books on psychiatry. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I told her "You'd better get away for a day and relax. "The strain is becoming too much for you." </seg>
<seg id="319"> Leaving Zelig alone, Dr. Fletcher takes Paul Deghuee's advice and she and her fiancé spend some hours off relaxing. </seg>
<seg id="320"> They go to Broadway, then to a well-known nightclub, where, despite a lively stage show, Dr. Fletcher is distracted and uneasy. </seg>
<seg id="321"> She is unable to think of anything but her patient. </seg>
<seg id="322"> The atmosphere with her fiancé, Koslow, is awkward and strained. </seg>
<seg id="323"> He is put off by her total obsession with Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Ironically, it is in the noisy and smoke-filled atmosphere of the nightclub that Eudora Fletcher is struck by a brilliant and innovative plan that will create a major breakthrough in the case. </seg>
<seg id="325"> - Dr. Zelig? - Yes? </seg>
<seg id="326"> I... I wonder if you could help me with a problem. </seg>
<seg id="327"> Well, I'll certainly try. Of course, we can't promise anything, you know. </seg>
<seg id="328"> You see, last week I was with a group of fairly erudite people who were discussing the novel Moby Dick, and I... I was afraid to admit that I hadn't read it, so I lied. </seg>
<seg id="329"> You see, I want so badly to be liked, to be like other people so that I don't stand out. </seg>
<seg id="330"> - That's natural. - I go to such extreme lengths to blend in. </seg>
<seg id="331"> Well... You're a doctor, you know? You... should know how to handle that. </seg>
<seg id="332"> No, but the truth of the matter is, I... I'm not an actual doctor. </seg>
<seg id="333"> - You're not? - No, Doctor. </seg>
<seg id="334"> No, I've... I've been pretending to be a doctor to fit in with my friends. </seg>
<seg id="335"> You see, they're doctors. </seg>
<seg id="336"> That's... That's something. </seg>
<seg id="337"> But you're a doctor, and you can help me. You have to help me. </seg>
<seg id="338"> Actually... I don't feel that well, actually. </seg>
<seg id="339"> But my... My whole life's just been a lie. </seg>
<seg id="340"> I've been posing as one thing after another. </seg>
<seg id="341"> Well, you... You need help, lady. Um... </seg>
<seg id="342"> Last night... Last night, I dreamt that I was falling into fire. </seg>
<seg id="343"> What does that mean? </seg>
<seg id="344"> That's terrible. I don't know. You know, I... Please, Doctor. I know I'm a very complicated patient. </seg>
<seg id="345"> - Jesus. I don't feel that well. - What am I suffering from? </seg>
<seg id="346"> How should I know? I'm not a doctor. </seg>
<seg id="347"> - You're not? - No. Am I? </seg>
<seg id="348"> - Who are you? - What do you mean, who am I? </seg>
<seg id="349"> - I don't know. These are tough questions. - Leonard Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="350"> - Yes, definitely. Who is he? - You. </seg>
<seg id="351"> No. I'm nobody. I'm nothing. </seg>
<seg id="352"> Catch me, I'm falling. </seg>
<seg id="353"> Playing on Zelig's identity disorder, </seg>
<seg id="354"> Dr. Fletcher has manipulated him into momentary disorientation. </seg>
<seg id="355"> With his guard lowered, she quickly puts him under hypnosis. </seg>
<seg id="356"> Using posthypnotic suggestion, she will now be able to induce a trance at will. </seg>
<seg id="357"> My brother beat me. </seg>
<seg id="358"> My sister beat my brother. </seg>
<seg id="359"> My father beat my sister and my brother and me. </seg>
<seg id="360"> My mother beat my father and my sister and me and my brother. </seg>
<seg id="361"> The neighbors beat our family. </seg>
<seg id="362"> People down the block beat the neighbors and our family. </seg>
<seg id="363"> I'm 12 years old. </seg>
<seg id="364"> I run into a synagogue. </seg>
<seg id="365"> I ask the rabbi the meaning of life. </seg>
<seg id="366"> He tells me the meaning of life, but he tells it to me in Hebrew. </seg>
<seg id="367"> I don't understand Hebrew. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Then he wants to charge me $600 for Hebrew lessons. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Dr. Fletcher's therapy consists of a two-pronged attack. </seg>
<seg id="370"> In the trance state, the personality will be deeply probed and then restructured. In the conscious state, she will provide love and affection, unconditional positive regard. </seg>
<seg id="371"> You will be completely honest. </seg>
<seg id="372"> You're in a deep trance. </seg>
<seg id="373"> You will become, not who you think I want you to be, but you'll be yourself. </seg>
<seg id="374"> Now, how do you feel about it here? </seg>
<seg id="375"> It's the worst. </seg>
<seg id="376"> I hate the country. </seg>
<seg id="377"> I hate the grass and the mosquitoes. </seg>
<seg id="378"> And cooking... Your cooking is terrible. </seg>
<seg id="379"> Your pancakes... </seg>
<seg id="380"> They're... I dump them in the garbage when you're not looking. </seg>
<seg id="381"> - Uh-huh. - And the jokes you try and tell when... When you think you're amusing, they're long and pointless, there's no end to them. </seg>
<seg id="382"> I see. And what else? </seg>
<seg id="383"> I wanna go to bed with you. </seg>
<seg id="384"> Oh... That surprises me. I didn't think you liked me very much. </seg>
<seg id="385"> I love you. </seg>
<seg id="386"> You do? </seg>
<seg id="387"> You're very sweet, 'cause you're... You're not as clever as you think you are. </seg>
<seg id="388"> You're all mixed up, and nervous, and you're the worst cook. </seg>
<seg id="389"> Those pancakes... </seg>
<seg id="390"> Oh, I love you. </seg>
<seg id="391"> I wanna take care of you. </seg>
<seg id="392"> No more pancakes. </seg>
<seg id="393"> I started out by trying to use Leonard to make my reputation, and then I found that I had very strong feelings for him. </seg>
<seg id="394"> I never thought I was attractive. </seg>
<seg id="395"> I never had a real romance. </seg>
<seg id="396"> Charles Koslow was the type of man my mother felt I should marry. </seg>
<seg id="397"> Feeling more confident every day with her patient, Dr. Fletcher takes him for a cautious outing, an afternoon at her sister's house in nearby Teaneck. </seg>
<seg id="398"> Meryl Fletcher is an aviatrix, a fine professional pilot. </seg>
<seg id="399"> Eudora Fletcher is an amateur pilot, and the afternoon is spent relaxing and retelling old flying experiences. </seg>
<seg id="400"> As the weeks pass, Zelig is encouraged to open up more and more, to give his own opinions. </seg>
<seg id="401"> What was guarded at first soon becomes expansive. </seg>
<seg id="402"> I hated my stepmother, and I don't care who knows it. </seg>
<seg id="403"> I love baseball. </seg>
<seg id="404"> You know, it doesn't have to mean anything, it's just very beautiful to watch. </seg>
<seg id="405"> I'm a Democrat. I always was a Democrat. </seg>
<seg id="406"> Is it okay if I don't agree with you about that recording? </seg>
<seg id="407"> Of course. I mean, Brahms is just always too melodramatic for me. </seg>
<seg id="408"> You have to be your own person and make your own moral choices, even when they do require real courage, otherwise you're like a robot, or a lizard. </seg>
<seg id="409"> Are you really gonna get married to that lawyer? </seg>
<seg id="410"> I... I would much rather you didn't. </seg>
<seg id="411"> No, I don't agree. I think this guy Mussolini is a loser. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Uh... Are we ever gonna make love? </seg>
<seg id="413"> It has been three months, and the board wishes to examine the patient. </seg>
<seg id="414"> Dr. Fletcher says Zelig is not ready to leave the premises. </seg>
<seg id="415"> The doctors agree to visit him there. </seg>
<seg id="416"> The date is set, four days hence. </seg>
<seg id="417"> If progress is insufficient, she will be removed from the case. </seg>
<seg id="418"> I was very nervous, because in his waking state he never remembered anything from his trance state, and I wondered if there could be some way of locking these two things together. </seg>
<seg id="419"> And then I also was worried that if he was with strong personalities, he might lose his personality. </seg>
<seg id="420"> Sunday at noon. The doctors arrive. </seg>
<seg id="421"> They are greeted by Eudora Fletcher and Leonard Zelig and are shown around the grounds. </seg>
<seg id="422"> Though Dr. Fletcher is tense and alert, </seg>
<seg id="423"> Leonard Zelig seems calm and at ease. </seg>
<seg id="424"> Despite the fact that he is surrounded by physicians, he does not turn into one. </seg>
<seg id="425"> The encounter appears to be a resounding success, when Dr. Henry Mayerson comments innocently about the weather, saying that it is a nice day. </seg>
<seg id="426"> Zelig tells Dr. Mayerson that he does not agree that it is a nice day. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Dr. Mayerson is taken aback at the firmness of Zelig's conviction. </seg>
<seg id="428"> He points out that the sun is shining and that it is mild. </seg>
<seg id="429"> Zelig, trained to voice his own personal opinions fearlessly, is too aggressive. He has been molded too far in the other direction. He has become over-opinionated, and cannot brook any disagreement with his own views. </seg>
<seg id="430"> I had taken him too far in the other direction. </seg>
<seg id="431"> He had struck Dr. Mayerson and several board members with a rake. </seg>
<seg id="432"> This was not what we wanted, and yet I felt that I had accomplished something. </seg>
<seg id="433"> I felt if I could have him for two more weeks, I could do some fine-tuning and turn Leonard Zelig back into his own man. </seg>
<seg id="434"> Dr. Eudora Nesbit Fletcher, the hero, or should we say heroine, of the hour. </seg>
<seg id="435"> The beautiful and brilliant psychiatrist never lost faith in her conviction that Leonard Zelig, the human chameleon, was suffering from a mental disorder. </seg>
<seg id="436"> Working with her cousin, cameraman Paul Deghuee, the doctor managed to keep a vital record of the proceedings including rare footage of Zelig hypnotized. </seg>
<seg id="437"> The patient and his healer have become fast friends in the process, and enjoy one another's company even when she's not working on him. </seg>
<seg id="438"> The result of maintaining a courageous minority opinion is a resounding success for psychiatry. </seg>
<seg id="439"> Who says women are just good for sewing? </seg>
<seg id="440"> Now it's on to City Hall, where the town's newest celebrities are given the key to the city. </seg>
<seg id="441"> We're honored to present this key to New York City to the two of you. </seg>
<seg id="442"> And, uh... Jimmy Walker did wanna be here this afternoon and sing Leonard the Lizard, but he was just too busy. </seg>
<seg id="443"> After City Hall, Eudora Fletcher, the beautiful genius who cured Zelig of his science-defying condition, is honored by fellow scientists at New York's Waldorf-Astoria. </seg>
<seg id="444"> Present are luminaries from all over the world, not just in the field of psychiatry, but physics, biology, mathematics, and you name it. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Here she is exchanging theories with Nils Andersen, the father of modern blood disease. </seg>
<seg id="446"> Later in the week, Dr. Fletcher is again honored by the greatest city in the world, as she gets to christen her first ship. </seg>
<seg id="447"> Quite a success story for a little girl from the backwoods. </seg>
<seg id="448"> I'm speaking to you from the home of Mrs. Catherine Fletcher. She's the mother of Dr. Eudora Fletcher, the famous psychiatrist so much in the news these days. </seg>
<seg id="449"> And I'm going to be asking Mrs. Fletcher to... To begin with, to tell us something about what it's like to raise a medical genius. And I might ask you about the many sacrifices that you've made to put your daughter through medical school. </seg>
<seg id="450"> And could you speak right into the microphones, please? </seg>
<seg id="451"> Sacrifices, we had none. John was a stockbroker, he had plenty of money, and I came from a wealthy Philadelphia family, so... </seg>
<seg id="452"> Well, I'm sure that your daughter always wanted to be a doctor, ever since she could remember. </seg>
<seg id="453"> I don't think so. </seg>
<seg id="454"> I always thought she'd want to be a flier like her sister Meryl and raise a family. - But she was a very moody... - But still, a mother always dreams for her child to have the kind of success that your daughter has. </seg>
<seg id="455"> - She was a very difficult girl. - Well, tell me about your husband. </seg>
<seg id="456"> I understand that he is a simple businessman. </seg>
<seg id="457"> He must be so thrilled and pleased </seg>
<seg id="458"> to have his daughter achieve such recognition. </seg>
<seg id="459"> John had problems, depression. He drank. </seg>
<seg id="460"> Well, Mrs. Fletcher, thank you so much for speaking with us today. </seg>
<seg id="461"> Here at San Simeon, glorious dreamland of newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst, celebrities from all walks of society, sun or play. </seg>
<seg id="462"> There's Marie Dressler with Mr. Hearst. Always a popular guest at San Simeon, </seg>
<seg id="463"> Miss Dressler accepts a flower from an ardent admirer. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Along with her is Marion Davies. </seg>
<seg id="465"> When she works, Miss Davies is always dead serious, but here at this fabulous playground, she shows us her fun side. </seg>
<seg id="466"> There she is with you-know-who, Charlie Chaplin, always kidding. </seg>
<seg id="467"> Although New York is 3,000 miles away, </seg>
<seg id="468"> Jimmy Walker somehow appears through Mr. Hearst's enchanted gateway. </seg>
<seg id="469"> Another New Yorker is Leonard Zelig, here shown clowning with everybody's favorite cowboy, Tom Mix. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Won't Tony be jealous? </seg>
<seg id="471"> Tony is Tom's horse, and we always thought they went everywhere together. </seg>
<seg id="472"> There's that fellow Chaplin again, this time with Adolphe Menjou. </seg>
<seg id="473"> There's Claire Windsor and Dolores del Rio, and a very charming Eudora Fletcher chatting with Hollywood's newest dancing sensation, James Cagney. </seg>
<seg id="474"> Oh, and what have we here? </seg>
<seg id="475"> Only a beautiful lady named Carole Lombard. </seg>
<seg id="476"> And there's Dr. Fletcher and Leonard Zelig hitting a few with Bobby Jones on Mr. Hearst's golf course. </seg>
<seg id="477"> Unless Leonard can go back to his old chameleon personality and turn into a golf pro, I'd bet my money on Bobby. </seg>
<seg id="478"> But who cares, if they're having fun? </seg>
<seg id="479"> Leonard Zelig, do you want to give the kids of this country some advice? </seg>
<seg id="480"> I sure do. Kids, you gotta be yourself. You know, you can't act like anybody else just because you think that they have all the answers and you don't. </seg>
<seg id="481"> You have to be your own man and learn to speak up and say what's on your mind. </seg>
<seg id="482"> Now, maybe they're not free to do that in foreign countries, but that's the American way. </seg>
<seg id="483"> And you can take it from me, because I used to be a member of the reptile family, but I'm not anymore. </seg>
<seg id="484"> Zelig, no longer a chameleon, is at last his own man. </seg>
<seg id="485"> His point of view on politics, art, life and love is honest and direct. </seg>
<seg id="486"> Though his taste is described by many as lowbrow, it is his own. </seg>
<seg id="487"> He is finally an individual, a human being. </seg>
<seg id="488"> He no longer gives up his own identity to be a safe and invisible part of his surroundings. </seg>
<seg id="489"> Oh, his taste wasn't terrible. </seg>
<seg id="490"> He was the kind of man who preferred watching baseball to reading Moby Dick. And that got him off on the wrong foot, or so the legend goes. </seg>
<seg id="491"> It was much more a matter of symbolism. To the Marxists, he was one thing. </seg>
<seg id="492"> The Catholic Church never forgave him for the Vatican incident. </seg>
<seg id="493"> The American people, in the throes of the Depression as they were, found in him a symbol of possibility, of self-improvement and self-fulfillment. </seg>
<seg id="494"> And of course, the Freudians had a ball. They could interpret him in any way they pleased. </seg>
<seg id="495"> It was all symbolism, but there were no two intellectuals who agreed about what it meant. </seg>
<seg id="496"> I don't know if you could call it a triumph of psychotherapy. It seems more like a triumph of aesthetic instincts, because Dr. Fletcher's techniques didn't owe anything to then-current schools of therapy. </seg>
<seg id="497"> But she sensed what was needed and she provided it, and that was, in its way, a remarkable creative accomplishment. </seg>
<seg id="498"> When I think about it, it seems to me that his story reflected a lot of the Jewish experience in America, the great urge to push in and to find one's place and then to assimilate into the culture. </seg>
<seg id="499"> I mean, he wanted to assimilate like crazy. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Eudora Fletcher's life has also changed from this experience. </seg>
<seg id="501"> For her, fame and recognition are empty rewards and do not live up to the adolescent fantasies that prompted her ambition. </seg>
<seg id="502"> She and her patient have fallen in love, and it is no surprise when she forsakes the upwardly mobile attorney Koslow and announces wedding plans with Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="503"> It was wonderful to see my sister and Leonard together. </seg>
<seg id="504"> She drew strength from him, and they were so much in love with each other. She looked happier than she had in years. </seg>
<seg id="505"> I remember they decided to get married in the spring, and then, of course, the roof fell in. </seg>
<seg id="506"> Two weeks before the wedding, an ex-showgirl named Lita Fox comes forth and claims that she is married to Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="507"> She also claims to have had his child. </seg>
<seg id="508"> It is an immediate scandal. </seg>
<seg id="509"> We were married a year ago. He said he was an actor. </seg>
<seg id="510"> He sounded just like one, and I'm in show business, too. </seg>
<seg id="511"> So we drove to Baltimore and we were married, and I have a license to prove it. </seg>
<seg id="512"> He had married her while under a different personality. </seg>
<seg id="513"> When she read of the plans for his forthcoming wedding to Eudora Fletcher, she was mortified and decided to take legal action. </seg>
<seg id="514"> Zelig says he will fight it in court, but public opinion begins subtly to shift away from him. </seg>
<seg id="515"> Clever attorneys portray Lita Fox as an abandoned woman. </seg>
<seg id="516"> The child is neglected, poor and fatherless. </seg>
<seg id="517"> Zelig has sold his life story to Hollywood for a large sum of money. </seg>
<seg id="518"> When the scandal breaks, the studio demands its money back. </seg>
<seg id="519"> Zelig can only return half as the rest has already been spent. </seg>
<seg id="520"> Outraged, the studio gives him half his life back. They keep the best moments, and he is left with only his sleeping hours and mealtimes. </seg>
<seg id="521"> Zelig is shaken by the scandal, but it is only the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="522"> Now another woman steps forward. Helen Gray, a salesgirl from a Wisconsin gift shop claims that Zelig is the father of her twins. </seg>
<seg id="523"> She tells her lawyers that he passed himself off as a fur trapper. </seg>
<seg id="524"> Zelig has no recollection, but admits it could have happened when he was under one of his spells. </seg>
<seg id="525"> It is the signal for the floodgates to open. </seg>
<seg id="526"> He married me up at the First Church of Harlem. </seg>
<seg id="527"> He told me he was the brother of Duke Ellington. </seg>
<seg id="528"> He was the guy who smashed my car up. It was brand-new. </seg>
<seg id="529"> Then he backed up over my mother's wrist. </seg>
<seg id="530"> She's elderly, and uses her wrist a lot. </seg>
<seg id="531"> He painted my house a disgusting color. He said he was a painter. I couldn't believe the results. Then he disappeared. </seg>
<seg id="532"> That Zelig could be responsible for the behavior of each of the personalities he assumed means dozens of lawsuits. </seg>
<seg id="533"> He is sued for bigamy, adultery, automobile accidents, plagiarism, household damages, negligence, property damages, and performing unnecessary dental extractions. </seg>
<seg id="534"> I would like to apologize to everyone. </seg>
<seg id="535"> I'm awfully sorry for marrying all those women. </seg>
<seg id="536"> It just... I don't know, it just seemed like the thing to do. </seg>
<seg id="537"> And to the gentleman whose appendix I took out, I'm... I don't know what to say. </seg>
<seg id="538"> If it's any consolation, I may still have it somewhere around the house. </seg>
<seg id="539"> My deepest apology goes to the Trokman family in Detroit. </seg>
<seg id="540"> I... I never delivered a baby before in my life, and I, I just thought that ice tongs was the way to do it. </seg>
<seg id="541"> Thriving mercilessly on loopholes and technicalities, the American legal profession has a field day. </seg>
<seg id="542"> Zelig is branded a criminal. Despite Dr. Fletcher's insistence that he cannot be held responsible for his actions while in his chameleon state, it is no use. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Leonard Zelig sets a bad moral influence. America is a moral country. It's a God-fearing country. </seg>
<seg id="544"> We don't condone scandals, scandals of fraud and polygamy. </seg>
<seg id="545"> In keeping with a pure society, I say lynch the little Hebe! </seg>
<seg id="546"> Throughout the humiliating ordeal, Eudora Fletcher stands by the man she loves, valiantly. </seg>
<seg id="547"> Privately, she tells friends that she is worried about Zelig's emotional condition, which seems to her to be deteriorating under the weight of conservative moral opinion. </seg>
<seg id="548"> In public, he tries to keep up an appearance of composure, but it is increasingly difficult. </seg>
<seg id="549"> It is clear he is coming apart when he and Eudora Fletcher dine at a Greek restaurant, and in the midst of the meal, Zelig begins to turn Greek. </seg>
<seg id="550"> He longs desperately to be liked once again, to be accepted, to fit in. </seg>
<seg id="551"> Public clamor over his morality reaches a fever pitch, and on the eve of his sentencing, Leonard Zelig vanishes. </seg>
<seg id="552"> This is Chief Inspector of Police Thomas Dowd with a national broadcasting news break. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Leonard Zelig is missing. On the eve of his sentencing for an assortment of crimes and misdemeanors ranging from polygamy to fraud, he has disappeared. </seg>
<seg id="554"> We are searching for clues and would appreciate speaking with anyone who might have any information leading to his apprehension. </seg>
<seg id="555"> My sister was just shattered. </seg>
<seg id="556"> She tried, you know, she tried to keep up a calm front but she was just too upset. </seg>
<seg id="557"> And she wasn't a person who usually displayed emotion easily, except where Leonard was concerned. </seg>
<seg id="558"> Dr. Fletcher and the police confer daily. Together they make public appeals to anyone who might know of his whereabouts. </seg>
<seg id="559"> Apart from several crank telephone calls, there is little response. </seg>
<seg id="560"> Months go by and Zelig is not heard from. </seg>
<seg id="561"> Cars are searched. False leads pour in from everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="562"> His jacket is recovered in Texas. A manhunt in that state proves futile. </seg>
<seg id="563"> He is reported seen in Chicago, in California. </seg>
<seg id="564"> This still photo appears to have a man resembling him with a mariachi band in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="565"> Dr. Fletcher continues to search for Zelig, but hopes fade with each passing day. </seg>
<seg id="566"> All I could think of was Leonard and how much I missed him and loved him, and of all the terrific times we'd spent together. </seg>
<seg id="567"> It was really a very painful time for me. </seg>
<seg id="568"> The year ends, and Zelig is still missing. </seg>
<seg id="569"> I just moped around and wept. </seg>
<seg id="570"> And one night, after a very bad time, my sister Meryl said to me, "Come on, let's go out for dinner. "Let's go to a concert." I said, "No, I can't do it." But she insisted. </seg>
<seg id="571"> And we went out and finally ended up in a movie. </seg>
<seg id="572"> We saw Grand Hotel and with it, there was a newsreel. </seg>
<seg id="573"> Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist Party continue to consolidate gains in Depression-ridden Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="574"> Denouncing the Treaty of Versailles, the Nazis make fervent appeals to German patriotism, promising to rebuild... </seg>
<seg id="575"> Eudora Fletcher is stunned by what she sees. </seg>
<seg id="576"> Amongst the Brownshirts, she spots a figure who could be Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="577"> Yes, but then it really made sense, it made all the sense in the world, because although he wanted to be loved, craved to be loved, there was also something in him that desired immersion in the mass and anonymity, and fascism offered Zelig that kind of opportunity. So he could make something anonymous of himself by belonging to this vast movement. </seg>
<seg id="578"> She sails for Europe the following week. Ten days later, she arrives in Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="579"> Germany is a country deep in the throes of the Depression. </seg>
<seg id="580"> Militarism and unrest are in the air. </seg>
<seg id="581"> She searches everywhere and makes enquiries, but it is impossible. </seg>
<seg id="582"> After three weeks, the authorities begin to get suspicious. </seg>
<seg id="583"> They watch her. While she is out, they search her hotel room. </seg>
<seg id="584"> A fourth week goes by, and she is about to give up and go home, when news of a large rally at Munich catches her attention. </seg>
<seg id="585"> It is rumored that it will be the largest gathering to date of Nazi personnel. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Eudora Fletcher is counting on the hope that Zelig may also attend. And that if she can confront him, the strong feeling he has always had for her can be awakened. </seg>
<seg id="587"> At first, all appears hopeless. The crowd is huge, and it seems impossible to locate any one particular face. Then, suddenly, a figure flanking the Chancellor captures her attention. </seg>
<seg id="588"> Behind and to the right of Hitler, she spots Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Struggling to make contact, she manages to catch his eye. </seg>
<seg id="590"> Like a man emerging from a dream, Zelig notices her. </seg>
<seg id="591"> In a matter of seconds, everything comes back to him. </seg>
<seg id="592"> It was nothing like it happened in the movie. </seg>
<seg id="593"> When Leonard came down from the podium, they didn't know what to think. </seg>
<seg id="594"> We couldn't believe our eyes. Hitler's speech was ruined. </seg>
<seg id="595"> He wanted to make a good joke about Poland, but just then, Zelig interfered and Hitler was extremely upset. </seg>
<seg id="596"> The SS wanted to grab Zelig, but if they would have grabbed him, they probably would have tortured him, or maybe even shot him. </seg>
<seg id="597"> In the confusion, Fletcher and Zelig got out of the building through a side door. </seg>
<seg id="598"> They grabbed a car. They sped away in the car, and the SS after them, shot them... </seg>
<seg id="599"> In rare German newsreel footage, a quick glimpse of the escape was recorded. </seg>
<seg id="600"> I was flying! It was wonderful. And then... Suddenly, something happened. I was frightened. I lost control. We went into a dive. </seg>
<seg id="601"> Leonard was so terrified that he changed his personality, and before my eyes, because I was a pilot, he turned into one, too. </seg>
<seg id="602"> Zelig takes control of the airplane. Acting the role of pilot, he struggles valiantly with the aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="603"> The Germans, who are stunned, take a full 15 minutes before they follow in hot pursuit of their quarry. </seg>
<seg id="604"> With Eudora Fletcher unconscious, Zelig, who had never flown before in his life, not only escapes the German pilots, but sets a record for flying nonstop across the Atlantic upside down. </seg>
<seg id="605"> New York welcomes back Eudora Fletcher and Leonard Zelig, the human chameleon. </seg>
<seg id="606"> His remarkable feat of aviation fills the nation with pride and earns him a full presidential pardon. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Forgiving multitudes flock to see him as he sits by the side of his plucky bride-to-be. </seg>
<seg id="608"> Their journey of triumph leads to City Hall. </seg>
<seg id="609"> New York's greatest honor, the Medal of Valor, is bestowed on Zelig by Carter Dean. </seg>
<seg id="610"> You are a great inspiration to the young of this nation who will one day grow up and be great doctors and great patients. </seg>
<seg id="611"> This is a great thrill. </seg>
<seg id="612"> I'm glad we lived to see this day. </seg>
<seg id="613"> I've never flown before in my life, and it shows exactly what you can do if you're a total psychotic. </seg>
<seg id="614"> The thing was paradoxical, because what enabled him to perform this astounding feat was his ability to transform himself. </seg>
<seg id="615"> Therefore, his sickness was also at the root of his salvation, and I think it's interesting to view the thing that way, that it was his very disorder that made a hero of him. </seg>
<seg id="616"> It was really absurd in a way. </seg>
<seg id="617"> I mean, he had this curious quirk, this strange characteristic, and for a time, everyone loved him, and then people stopped loving him, and then he did this stunt, you know, with the airplane, and then everybody loved him again, and that was what the '20s were like. </seg>
<seg id="618"> When you think about it, has America changed so much? I don't think so. </seg>
<seg id="619"> After untangling countless legal details, </seg>
<seg id="620"> Leonard Zelig and Eudora Fletcher marry. </seg>
<seg id="621"> It is a simple ceremony, captured on home movies. </seg>
<seg id="622"> "Wanting only to be liked, he distorted himself beyond measure, " wrote Scott Fitzgerald. </seg>
<seg id="623"> "One wonders what would have happened if, right at the outset, "he had had the courage to speak his mind and not pretend. </seg>
<seg id="624"> "In the end it was, after all, "not the approbation of many, but the love of one woman that changed his life." </seg>
