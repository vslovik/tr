<seg id="1"> It was the phenomenon of the 1920s. </seg>
<seg id="2"> If you think that at the time it was as famous as Lindbergh ... it's really sophisticated. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Its history reflects the nature of our civilization ... the character of our times. Yet it is also the story of a man ... and there are all the issues of our culture ... heroism, will, things like these ... </seg>
<seg id="4"> but when one thinks about it, it was really weird. </seg>
<seg id="5"> It is ironic to see ... how quickly it has vanished from our memory ... considering the impressive record he had established. </seg>
<seg id="6"> It was very funny, of course ... but at the same time it did touch something inside people ... maybe in a way they would prefer to avoid. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is certainly a very bizarre story. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The year is 1928. </seg>
<seg id="9"> America, which has come from a decade of unprecedented prosperity, is crazy. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The age of Jazz, so it was called. Rhythms are syncopated, costumes are more relaxed. Liqueurs are less expensive when they are found. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It is an era of heroes of various kinds, of discredited acrobatics ... of clandestine bars and gorgeous festivals. </seg>
<seg id="12"> A typical party takes place in the Long Island estate ... </seg>
<seg id="13"> of Sutton ... people in sight and patrons. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Politicians and poets ... are elbow with the cream of high society. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The party is featured by Scott Fitzgerald ... who sets a 20th century portrait on paper ... </seg>
<seg id="16"> for subsequent generations. He writes on his notebook ... something about a curious little man, named Leon Selwin, or Zelman ... who seemed undoubtedly an aristocrat ... and exalted the riches' talents while chatting with the people of the beautiful world. </seg>
<seg id="17"> He spoke of Coolidge and the Republican Party with veneration ... all with a refined accent of Boston. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "An hour later," writes Fitzgerald ... "I was stuck in seeing the same person ..." talking to the kitchen guards. </seg>
<seg id="19"> "This time he claimed to be a Democrat ..." and his accent was cruder, as if he were one of the people "... This is the first time Leonard Zelig has been told. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Florida, a year later. </seg>
<seg id="21"> There is a strange incident ... in the New York Yankees training camp. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Journalists, as always anxious ... to immortalize the great batters' business ... notice a strange new player ... waiting for his turn after Babe Ruth. </seg>
<seg id="23"> He's listed as Lou Zelig ... but none of the team ever heard about him. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Guards are called ... and escorted out of the facility. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The fact appears in a loophole in the newspapers of the next day. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Chicago, Illinois, same year. </seg>
<seg id="27"> There is a private party ... in a clandestine bar on the South Side. </seg>
<seg id="28"> People belonging to respectable classes ... dance and drink distilled gin in the house. </seg>
<seg id="29"> That evening is Calvin Turner, a waiter. </seg>
<seg id="30"> There was a lot of gangsters in the room. </seg>
<seg id="31"> They give us good tips and treat us well. And we treated our customers well. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In that particular evening, it's a weird guy. I never saw her before ... so I ask the other waiters ... </seg>
<seg id="33"> "John, do you know that guy?" Have you ever seen him? "He looks at it and ..." No, never seen before. </seg>
<seg id="34"> "I do not know who he is ..." but what I know is that he has the tough air "... </seg>
<seg id="35"> So I look again and ... the guy was gone. </seg>
<seg id="36"> I do not know where she went ... but at that moment usually the music starts ... and the band starts playing. Have a look and I see a kind of color that plays the trumpet. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Damn, it did not sound bad at all! I look good at the guy ... and I say "it looks like that gangster before ..." but that was white, while this guy is black "... and just did not realize it was happening ...! </seg>
<seg id="38"> New York City. A few months later. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The police are investigating the disappearance of an employee ... named Leonard Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Both her homeowner and her employer ... have reported her disappearance. </seg>
<seg id="41"> They describe it to the Police as a strange little man who was on his own. </seg>
<seg id="42"> There are two clues in the Zelig apartment at Greenwich Village. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The first is a photograph of Zelig with Eugene O'Neill ... the other one where he looks like the protagonist of "Pagliacci". </seg>
<seg id="44"> Based on a blown, they trace him around Chinatown ... where, in the back of a Chinese shop ... an oriental odd look is found ... which corresponds to Leonard Zelig's description. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Surprised, the investigators try to tear off camming ... but it's not a camouflage, and a brawl breaks. </seg>
<seg id="46"> He is taken away by force and led to the Manhattan Hospital. </seg>
<seg id="47"> In the ambulance, she shouts and angers ... in a language that seems to be just Chinese. </seg>
<seg id="48"> It is held firmly with the jacket. </seg>
<seg id="49"> When he comes out of the car, he is no longer a Chinese ... but a white man. </seg>
<seg id="50"> The doctors, disconcerted, send him to the emergency room ... in observation. </seg>
<seg id="51"> By 7, Dr. Eudora Fletcher, a psychiatrist ... is doing his usual lap. </seg>
<seg id="52"> When I heard of this particular case ... I did not think of anything special ... and when I first saw him ... it was a little strange, because I switched it to a doctor. </seg>
<seg id="53"> He had a way to behave very ... professional. </seg>
<seg id="54"> As a young psychiatrist he was ... Eudora Fletcher is fascinated by Leonard Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="55"> It convinces the members of the hospital staff, quite traditional ... to let them study the new patient. </seg>
<seg id="56"> - What profession do you do? - I? I'm a psychiatrist. </seg>
<seg id="57"> - Oh yes? - I work especially with paranoids. </seg>
<seg id="58"> - You talk to me. - Oh, there is not much to say. </seg>
<seg id="59"> I work mostly in Europe ... and I've written several articles of psychoanalysis. </seg>
<seg id="60"> I studied a lot. I worked with Freud in Vienna. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Our disagreement began with the envy of the penis. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Freud maintained that it should be limited to women. </seg>
<seg id="63"> It was not what he said was completely meaningless. </seg>
<seg id="64"> It was a mixture of obscure phrases in jargon by psychologists ... </seg>
<seg id="65"> which he had probably heard somewhere ... or had learned by reading. </seg>
<seg id="66"> The funny thing was that his talk was really smooth ... and he could even be convincing ... for someone not in the trade. </seg>
<seg id="67"> Who was this Leonard Zelig, who seemed to stir everywhere ... so different impressions? </seg>
<seg id="68"> All we know about him is that he was a son ... of a Jewish actor named Morris Zelig ... whose interpretations of Puck ... in the Hebrew-orthodox version of "Midnight Midnight Dream" .. He was coldly received. </seg>
<seg id="69"> The second wedding of Father Zelig ... is characterized by a series of violent quarrels so much that ... although the family is dressed up on a bowling ... it's just from bowling noise that comes to the noise. </seg>
<seg id="70"> As a child, Leonard is often targeted by anti-Semites. </seg>
<seg id="71"> His parents, who never take his defenses ... and if they take it with him for anything, they go for anti-Semites. </seg>
<seg id="72"> They often punish him by locking him in a darkroom. </seg>
<seg id="73"> When they are angry ... they enter the closet with him. </seg>
<seg id="74"> On the deathbed, Morris Zelig tells his son ... that life is a useless nightmare full of suffering ... and the only advice it is given is to keep the laces of the shoes used. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Though his brother Jack has a nervous breakdown ... and his sister Ruth is a thief and an alcoholic ... Leonard Zelig seems to have adapted to life. </seg>
<seg id="76"> Somehow, he can arrange himself. </seg>
<seg id="77"> Then, suddenly, an increasingly strange behavior. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Fascinated by the Zelig phenomenon ... Dr. Fletcher organizes a series of experiments ... and invites skeptical colleagues to observe. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Under the eyes of the doctors, Zelig becomes a perfect psychiatrist. </seg>
<seg id="80"> When two Frenchmen come in ... Zelig takes care of their character and speaks a discreet French. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Alongside a Chinese ... it begins to take on an oriental look. </seg>
<seg id="82"> At this point, the story is leaked to the press ... and the audience, always thrilled with emotions and novelties ... has been attracted to it. </seg>
<seg id="83"> The shock is so ... that Dr. Allan Sindell is forced to make a statement. </seg>
<seg id="84"> Let's just begin to understand the real dimensions ... of what might be the medical discovery of the century ... if not all the time. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Every day, the press publishes new details ... on Zelig and its disconcerting condition. </seg>
<seg id="86"> Although the doctors claim to have the situation under control ... they do not even agree on the same diagnosis. </seg>
<seg id="87"> It depends on the endocrine system. Although there is no evidence of dysfunction ... I am sure that further analysis will confirm the problem. </seg>
<seg id="88"> He took it by eating Mexican food. </seg>
<seg id="89"> They are neurological symptoms. </seg>
<seg id="90"> The patient suffers from a brain tumor ... and I would not be surprised if he died in a few weeks. </seg>
<seg id="91"> We have not been able to locate the tumor yet ... but we are looking for it. </seg>
<seg id="92"> Ironically, it was Dr. Birsky ... to die of brain tumor within two weeks. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Leonard Zelig is fine. </seg>
<seg id="94"> During these weeks of experiments and guesses ... Eudora Fletcher begins to guess ... that the patient might suffer ... not a physiological disorder ... but a psychic. </seg>
<seg id="95"> It is Zelig's unstable physical constitution that suggests ... the explanation for his metamorphosis. </seg>
<seg id="96"> The doctors advice is hostile to his theory. </seg>
<seg id="97"> They conclude that Zelig's disease ... would be attributed to a defect in alignment of the vertebrae. </seg>
<seg id="98"> The tests prove they are wrong ... and cause a temporary problem to the patient. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Now, the press and the public cling to every little news ... totally taken from this human drama. </seg>
<seg id="100"> The saga of the strange creature of the Manhattan Hospital continues. </seg>
<seg id="101"> Experiences have been made today. Women of various kinds were placed close to the subject ... but there was no change. It would be deduced ... that the phenomenon does not occur with women. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Later, doctors will experiment with a dwarf and a chicken. </seg>
<seg id="103"> Leonard Zelig continues to astonish doctors at the Manhattan Hospital ... after numerous tests have failed ... to determine the nature of this amazing phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="104"> At the request of doctors, the patient meets two overweight men. </seg>
<seg id="105"> While men talk about their obesity, Zelig, after an initial reticence ... joins them, reaching the incredible weight of 113 pounds. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Then, in the presence of two blacks ... </seg>
<seg id="107"> Zelig quickly becomes like them. </seg>
<seg id="108"> What will they invoke next time? </seg>
<seg id="109"> Meanwhile, the first reactions of Americans come. </seg>
<seg id="110"> I would like to be Lenny Zelig, the Transformer. </seg>
<seg id="111"> I would be so many different people, and maybe my wishes would come true. </seg>
<seg id="112"> Leonard Zelig is one of the finest lords ... of all the United States of America. </seg>
<seg id="113"> It is a portent. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Tell me why I take the characteristics ... of the person you are with. </seg>
<seg id="115"> It's safe. </seg>
<seg id="116"> What do you mean by "safe"? </seg>
<seg id="117"> It's safe to be like the others. </seg>
<seg id="118"> Do you want to feel safe? </seg>
<seg id="119"> I want to be welcome. </seg>
<seg id="120"> Penetrating in Zelig's mouth ... Dr. Fletcher slowly puts together the pieces ... of that puzzle that is the behavior of Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Passing the time between the hospital ... and the 42nd street library, fill in your account. </seg>
<seg id="122"> The doctors, during a private meeting, listen to Dr. Fletcher ... describing Zelig as a "human chameleon". </seg>
<seg id="123"> Like the reptile, endowed with nature ... of a wonderful defense system ... which makes it capable of changing color ... and confusing with the surrounding environment ... also Zelig protects ... becoming anyone be near. </seg>
<seg id="124"> Doctors listen and their reaction is skepticism. </seg>
<seg id="125"> "Impossible," they say. "Absurd". </seg>
<seg id="126"> "If it's a lizard," jokes one of the doctors ... "we should not spend the hospital's precious money to feed it ..." but it would simply be enough to catch some fly. " </seg>
<seg id="127"> Well, we knew we had a good story, that time ... because it was inside of it all. Feeling ... suspense. </seg>
<seg id="128"> That one, Zelig, was born poor. </seg>
<seg id="129"> My editor-in-chief told me "Ted, this story ..." we want her on the front page every day "... </seg>
<seg id="130"> At that time, he would do his best to sell newspapers. </seg>
<seg id="131"> Usually she was taking a story, she was brave ... she exaggerated, she took some freedom with the facts. </seg>
<seg id="132"> But that was a real, genuine story. </seg>
<seg id="133"> It was enough to say the truth and sell newspapers. It never happened before! </seg>
<seg id="134"> Suddenly, Leonard Zelig became ... the main topic of conversation everywhere ... and he talks about it with amazement and fun. </seg>
<seg id="135"> There is no worldly gathering where there is no joke on Zelig ... and, in a decade characterized by so many dancing in vogue ... a new dragging the nation. </seg>
<seg id="136"> What is white, black and yellow, and has four eyes? </seg>
<seg id="137"> Leonard Zelig at the League of Nations. </seg>
<seg id="138"> Not everyone, anyway ... are enchanted by the human chameleon ... and among the extremist fanatics ... it becomes a convenient symbol of iniquity. </seg>
<seg id="139"> This is personifies the capitalist man. </seg>
<seg id="140"> A creature that takes many forms, to achieve ... its purposes, the exploitation of workers by deceit. </seg>
<seg id="141"> For Ku Klux Klan, Zelig ... a Jew capable of transforming ... into a nigger or a punk, is a threefold threat. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Meanwhile, Dr. Fletcher ... confident of the correctness of his discoveries ... begs to be given more time with the patient ... to put into practice his theories. </seg>
<seg id="143"> Do you remember when you started to behave like someone around you? </seg>
<seg id="144"> At school, my good companions asked me if I'd read Moby Dick. </seg>
<seg id="145"> - And then? - I was ashamed because I did not read it. </seg>
<seg id="146"> - So you pretended? - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="147"> When did the mutations begin to happen automatically? </seg>
<seg id="148"> Years ago. At St. Patrick's Day. </seg>
<seg id="149"> I went into a bar. I was not dressed in green. </seg>
<seg id="150"> They made comments. I become Irish. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Would you tell them to be Irish? </seg>
<seg id="152"> My hair became red, my nose turned me up. </seg>
<seg id="153"> I spoke of famine and gnomes. </seg>
<seg id="154"> We do not agree with Dr. Fletcher's ideas. </seg>
<seg id="155"> We believe that they are all fairy tales. </seg>
<seg id="156"> A change in Zelig's disease ... can only be achieved through some experimental medicines ... which, though risky, make wonders. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Zelig is treated with an experimental drug ... the somdrile hydrate. </seg>
<seg id="158"> It is going through severe mood changes ... and for several days it does not leave the wall. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Then, suddenly ... when Dr. Fletcher begins to get results ... Zelig's fate is taking a new turn ... when his sister Ruth amazes everyone by taking him away from the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="160"> "At home, you will be better cared for," he tells doctors. </seg>
<seg id="161"> Explain that he will be better assisted by her and her lover, Mertin Geist, of a misunderstanding ... a businessman and former Luna Park impresario. </seg>
<seg id="162"> There is little resistance from doctors ... happy to get rid of such a frustrating case. </seg>
<seg id="163"> Only Dr. Fletcher is interested in Zelig as a human being. </seg>
<seg id="164"> He insists he desperately needs special care ... but it's all worthless. </seg>
<seg id="165"> No, no one questioned his legal rights over Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="166"> She was her sister-in-law and she was reliant on her ... but she had a strange boyfriend, named Geist. </seg>
<seg id="167"> He had been in jail for real estate scams. </seg>
<seg id="168"> He sold the same property ... to a lot of different people. </seg>
<seg id="169"> A Delaware MP bought it twice. </seg>
<seg id="170"> The crowd lurking along the streets to see the escape ... the human chameleon blocks traffic for days. </seg>
<seg id="171"> It is an attraction for tourists and children. </seg>
<seg id="172"> People coming from all over the country get stuck for some space ... to take a look at this new wonder. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Souvenir sale ... while the brother is exhibited ... it's just the beginning, for Ruth Zelig and Martin Geist. </seg>
<seg id="174"> They pay the entrance for the two daily demonstrations ... of Leonard's extraordinary skill. </seg>
<seg id="175"> He does not disappoint anyone ... and he changes continuously, on request. </seg>
<seg id="176"> Suddenly, it has become an attraction, a novelty ... a barbarian phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="177"> In this 1935 film based on Zelig's life ... and titled "The Man Who Changes" ... this atmosphere is well described. </seg>
<seg id="178"> I can not give up. I know that if I have the chance I can cure it. </seg>
<seg id="179"> It's useless. The lawyer also says there is no hope. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Seriously, Dr. Fletcher ... can I call you Eudora? </seg>
<seg id="181"> Believe me, behind that vacuous face, that zombie look ... </seg>
<seg id="182"> there is a real human being, and I can make it come out. </seg>
<seg id="183"> - As? - I'll find the way. </seg>
<seg id="184"> A new technique. Whatever it is, it must be very personal. </seg>
<seg id="185"> I can not do it very legally. I'll try ... </seg>
<seg id="186"> They do not care about him. They exploit it. </seg>
<seg id="187"> In him they only see a chance to make money. Look. </seg>
<seg id="188"> They are already selling Leonard Zelig's doll. </seg>
<seg id="189"> The film did not exaggerate. There were not only pens and lucky lucky Leonard Zelig ... but also watches, toys, books ... and a famous Zelig puppet. </seg>
<seg id="190"> There were aprons, chamois-like earmuffs ... and a very popular Zelig game. </seg>
<seg id="191"> There were many famous songs ... inspired by Leonard Zelig, motives that dragged the whole nation. </seg>
<seg id="192"> In addition to products and sponsorships ... there are performances that do not end there. </seg>
<seg id="193"> Hollywood is very courteous ... and they offer him a contract for a movie. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Clara Bow invites him for a weekend with her ... and asks him to bring all his personalities. </seg>
<seg id="195"> Chicago meets the heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey ... who jokes with Zelig in the retreat he trains. </seg>
<seg id="196"> In Washington DC, they present him to Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover. </seg>
<seg id="197"> In France they call it "Le lézard" ... and become the main attraction of the Parisian music halls. </seg>
<seg id="198"> His business makes him dear to the main French intellectuals ... who see in him a symbol of everything. </seg>
<seg id="199"> His transformation into rabbi ... is so realistic that some French ... propose to be sent into exile on the Island of the Devil ... </seg>
<seg id="200"> At "Le Folies Bergère" ... Josephine Baker makes his version of the Chameleon Ball ... and later tells his friends ... that he found Zelig upbeat but somewhat lost. </seg>
<seg id="201"> Everyone came to my room ... I mean, all they counted ... and sometimes somebody carried us Zelig ... that is, Leonard ... </seg>
<seg id="202"> Cole Porter was fascinated by Leonard ... and once wrote a verse of a song ... </seg>
<seg id="203"> "You're the tops, you're Leonard Zelig" ... but he could not find anything he could do with Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="204"> "Flying up ..." because I feel I'm falling in love ... "falling in love with you and no one else. </seg>
<seg id="205"> "You've caught my gaze ..." and now I feel I'm falling in love. </seg>
<seg id="206"> "Show me that ring and I'll jump in. </seg>
<seg id="207"> "I was traveling alone." I had a chance to meet you ... "and now I feel a shiver for you. </seg>
<seg id="208"> "Hey, Mr. Zelig, he's ready ..." because I feel I'm falling in love ... "falling in love with you and no one else." </seg>
<seg id="209"> Although performances and parties ... come to Zelig's sister and her lover of wealth and fun ... Zelig's existence is actually a non-existence. </seg>
<seg id="210"> Without his personality ... his human qualities long lost in the drag of his life ... he sits alone, quietly staring at the void. It's a figure, a nullity, a joke of nature. </seg>
<seg id="211"> He just wanted to be part of something ... to walk between his enemies without being noticed, being loved ... he is neither involved nor part of anything ... he is strictly observed by his enemies and is not loved . </seg>
<seg id="212"> Everyone, in the hospital staff, forgot Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="213"> Only Dr. Fletcher continues to struggle to gain protection. </seg>
<seg id="214"> The court rejects its last appeal. </seg>
<seg id="215"> During his brave legal battle ... he is frequently in the company of his lawyer, Charles Koslow. </seg>
<seg id="216"> She falls in love with her ... and she asks her to marry her. </seg>
<seg id="217"> She is ambiguous. </seg>
<seg id="218"> With reluctance, he starts abandoning ... any hope of recovering Leonard Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="219"> That summer, Geist organized an exhibition in Spain. </seg>
<seg id="220"> It is the last stop of a European tour ... which has had a remarkable success. </seg>
<seg id="221"> The relations between Martin Geist and Ruth Zelig ... have been made. </seg>
<seg id="222"> They got tired of each other ... and they quarrel often. </seg>
<seg id="223"> The situation gets worse when you know Luis Martinez ... a mediocre and evil bullfight ... of whom he falls in love. </seg>
<seg id="224"> Though he wanted to impress Ruth Zelig ... </seg>
<seg id="225"> Martinez shows in the arena of his usual panic. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Luck is, however, on his side, this time ... because the bull gets a cerebral emotion. </seg>
<seg id="227"> Martinez takes credit for the killing ... and, cut the ear of the bull ... he offers it to his lover with a bribe. </seg>
<seg id="228"> That night, in jealousy access ... Martin Geist returns to his hotel room ... and faces Ruth Zelig. She asks you to give him his ear. </seg>
<seg id="229"> She refuses. Geist insists he has the ear. </seg>
<seg id="230"> They argue furiously, and you find out Martinez ... hiding in the closet. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Geist pulls out a gun and shoots him. </seg>
<seg id="232"> Then he turns his weapon to Zelig's sister-in-law and kills her. At that point, suicide. In an orgy of jealousy and violence ... Leonard Zelig's life is overturned. </seg>
<seg id="233"> At first, news comes to the fore in the world. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Then, with the same speed ... the audience, always thirsty of emotions, becomes indifferent. </seg>
<seg id="235"> New scandals get news headlines. </seg>
<seg id="236"> Everything moves so fast in the Jazz Age ... fast as Red Grange. </seg>
<seg id="237"> A saturated audience of distractions forgets quickly. </seg>
<seg id="238"> The 1920s culminated in a very serious crisis ... and Leonard Zelig is unavailable. </seg>
<seg id="239"> Dr. Eudora Fletcher seeks to find it unnecessarily. After many runs have turned out to be disappointing ... renunciation, discouraged. </seg>
<seg id="240"> I felt like a pity. It was a unique case ... with which I could build a solid reputation. </seg>
<seg id="241"> Not that I knew how to cure it ... but being able to have it alone ... finding the right path and being innovative and creative ... </seg>
<seg id="242"> I felt that I could change her life ... if only I had the chance. </seg>
<seg id="243"> Shoulder strap with 12 men ... </seg>
<seg id="244"> the gestational chair carrying the Holy Father reaches the central balcony ... from which the Pope will bless Rome and the whole world. </seg>
<seg id="245"> It has been for 63 years that this ceremony was not taking place ... that on this Sunday of Easter will end the rites of Holy Week. </seg>
<seg id="246"> What's happening? A hustle and bustle near the Holy Father. </seg>
<seg id="247"> There is an intruder. </seg>
<seg id="248"> Guards are called, while his sanctity Pius XI tries to hit the intruder with a pontifical decree. </seg>
<seg id="249"> The faithful do not believe in their eyes. </seg>
<seg id="250"> This is of course Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="251"> He is sent back to the United States ... from the Italian authorities ... and is again hospitalized at the Manhattan Hospital. </seg>
<seg id="252"> I am grateful for the opportunity to have Leonard Zelig in charge ... now that he is again under the hospital's responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="253"> I am glad that I have been granted this opportunity. </seg>
<seg id="254"> I sincerely hope to return to society a good citizen, master of self ... and no longer a circus phenomenon without identity. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Dr. Fletcher no longer has time to think about marriage. Now all her attention must be to Leonard Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="256"> His intention is to move him to his country house. </seg>
<seg id="257"> It will create a neutral environment, far from society. </seg>
<seg id="258"> He will seek new therapies to heal him ... in the hope of understanding his singular illness. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Aware of the importance of his work ... </seg>
<seg id="260"> Eudora Fletcher has a movie recording ... of the healing cycle. </seg>
<seg id="261"> In this regard, contact his cousin Paul Deghuee ... inventor and photographer in a timely manner. </seg>
<seg id="262"> He told me "I want to document this case ..." for future generations and for the scientific community. </seg>
<seg id="263"> "I want you to make the camera extremely silent." </seg>
<seg id="264"> I said, "Why do not you just take written notes?" </seg>
<seg id="265"> and she said, "Paul, when a man ..." changes his physical appearance, one must see it in action. </seg>
<seg id="266"> "You can not just read it." And besides, I'm going to go to history. " </seg>
<seg id="267"> The White Room is prepared with care ... to ensure maximum tranquility. </seg>
<seg id="268"> It's a small study at Dr. Fletcher's home ... furnished with a few furniture. </seg>
<seg id="269"> They are briefly nailed to the reflector walls for photography ... to have enough lighting. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Microphones are hidden at strategic points. </seg>
<seg id="271"> The camera is placed behind a glass panel ... which makes it fairly discreet. </seg>
<seg id="272"> The problem is motor noise. They dampen it with a blanket and with what they find underneath. </seg>
<seg id="273"> From this privileged but uncomfortable position ... photographer Paul Deghuee will feature ... the famous White Room Seats ... an outstanding document in the history of psychotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="274"> For current standards ... the White Room sessions appear very primitive ... and yet they were really effective ... in developing a very strong personal relationship ... between doctor and patient. </seg>
<seg id="275"> If Zelig was psychotic ... or just extremely neurotic ... it was a problem that we doctors ... we discussed constantly. </seg>
<seg id="276"> Personally, it seemed to me that his moods ... were not so different from the norm ... maybe those of a normal person ... well balanced and inserted ... only, brought to an extreme degree ... carried excess. </seg>
<seg id="277"> It seemed to me that we could ... in the end consider the conformist as antonoma. </seg>
<seg id="278"> Leonard, do you know why you're here? </seg>
<seg id="279"> To talk about psychiatry, right? </seg>
<seg id="280"> You are a doctor? </seg>
<seg id="281"> Yes. Have you read my article on manic paranoia? </seg>
<seg id="282"> In the end I found out that it's all a matter of head. </seg>
<seg id="283"> And if I told you not to be a doctor? </seg>
<seg id="284"> I'd say you're joking. </seg>
<seg id="285"> Is there always so much light here? </seg>
<seg id="286"> Oh, I'm filming these sessions. Hope you do not mind. </seg>
<seg id="287"> - No. Is anybody out there behind? - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="288"> A camera? </seg>
<seg id="289"> Leonard, why do not we go from the simple facts? </seg>
<seg id="290"> - Leonard, you're not a doctor - no? </seg>
<seg id="291"> No. You're a patient. I'm the doctor. </seg>
<seg id="292"> I would not say too many people if I was in you. </seg>
<seg id="293"> Leonard, you're not a doctor. </seg>
<seg id="294"> Can I leave it here alone? I... </seg>
<seg id="295"> I have to go back to town. Really. I have an interesting case. I follow two pairs of twin siamese twins with personality splitting. And I'm paid by eight people. </seg>
<seg id="296"> "The first week of sessions did not go very well ..." Dr. Fletcher writes in his diary. </seg>
<seg id="297"> "Leonard identifies with me ..." and is convinced he is the doctor. </seg>
<seg id="298"> "It is circumspect and suspicious. </seg>
<seg id="299"> "But it also has something very attractive." He has a mind awake and full of energy. </seg>
<seg id="300"> "Perhaps it is his helplessness that moves me. </seg>
<seg id="301"> "I have to stay flexible and go ahead with the intuition." </seg>
<seg id="302"> How are you doing today, Leonard? </seg>
<seg id="303"> Good. But I have to go back to town. </seg>
<seg id="304"> I have a masturbation course at the psychiatric institute and ... </seg>
<seg id="305"> - I understand - I'm a doctor. And ... "Masturbation dictated by guilt ..." No, no sense of guilt. I teach to an advanced level. </seg>
<seg id="306"> "I'm a very respected physician, Leonard, I wish ... that your eyes follow the pen and that you breathe deeply. </seg>
<seg id="307"> - Because? Thing? - Take it easy... </seg>
<seg id="308"> No. You're trying to hypnotize me ... </seg>
<seg id="309"> - You dry? - Of course I'm dry. I am a doctor. </seg>
<seg id="310"> - It's not true. - Yes, it is true. </seg>
<seg id="311"> - Relax - No, I can not. I have to go back to town. </seg>
<seg id="312"> I have the masturbation course. </seg>
<seg id="313"> If they do not start without me. </seg>
<seg id="314"> As the weeks pass ... Dr. Fletcher is increasingly frustrated. </seg>
<seg id="315"> "Leonard continues to insist on being a doctor ..." and even refuses to let go of hypnotism, "he writes. </seg>
<seg id="316"> "I think his last year's experience ..." have put him defensive as never before. </seg>
<seg id="317"> "It's daunting." It was in a state of great pressure ... it was just a bad thing, nervous. He was fine, he was sleeping, reading sitting in his armchair. He referred to himself as "Dr. Zelig". He read psychiatric books. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I told her to go away for a few days and relax a little. He was pulling the rope too far. </seg>
<seg id="319"> Leaving Zelig alone ... Dr. Fletcher accepts Paul Deghuee's advice ... and takes some hours of relaxation with her boyfriend. </seg>
<seg id="320"> They go to Broadway, then to a famous night club where ... despite the spectacle being lively ... Dr. Fletcher is distracted and uncomfortable. </seg>
<seg id="321"> He can not think of anything other than his patient. </seg>
<seg id="322"> The atmosphere between her and her boyfriend Koslow is embarrassing. </seg>
<seg id="323"> He is baffled by his obsession with Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Ironically, it's just in the smoky and noisy environment ... of the Night Club that Eudora Fletcher ... is blown away by a brilliant and innovative idea ... which will lead to a clumsy turn in the case. </seg>
<seg id="325"> - Dr. Zelig? - Yup? </seg>
<seg id="326"> Could you help me solve a problem? </seg>
<seg id="327"> I can definitely try it. I can not promise anything, obviously. </seg>
<seg id="328"> The other day I was in the presence of pretty educated people ... who discussed the novel Moby Dick ... and I was afraid to admit I had not read it, so I lied. </seg>
<seg id="329"> I wanted so much to be accepted, to be like the others, to be different. </seg>
<seg id="330"> - It's natural. - I really do everything to integrate. </seg>
<seg id="331"> But she is a doctor, she should know how to handle it. </seg>
<seg id="332"> But the fact is, in fact ... I'm not a real doctor. </seg>
<seg id="333"> - It is not? - No, doctor. </seg>
<seg id="334"> No, I'm pretending to be up to my friends. </seg>
<seg id="335"> You know, I'm a doctor. </seg>
<seg id="336"> What a story! just </seg>
<seg id="337"> But she is a doctor and can help me. It must help me. </seg>
<seg id="338"> To tell the truth ... I do not feel very good. </seg>
<seg id="339"> All my life was a lie. </seg>
<seg id="340"> I pretended to be one after the other. </seg>
<seg id="341"> She needs help, ma'am. </seg>
<seg id="342"> The other night I dreamed I fell in the fire. What does it mean? </seg>
<seg id="343"> It's terrible. I do not know. I... </seg>
<seg id="344"> Please, doctor. I know I'm a tough patient. </seg>
<seg id="345"> - Jesus. I do not feel very good. - What's my problem? </seg>
<seg id="346"> What do I know? I'm not a doctor. </seg>
<seg id="347"> - It is not? - No. Is that it? </seg>
<seg id="348"> - Who are you? - What does it mean, who am I? </seg>
<seg id="349"> - They are difficult questions. - Leonard Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="350"> - Definitely. Who is? - She. </seg>
<seg id="351"> No. I'm nobody. I'm nothing. </seg>
<seg id="352"> Take me ... I'm falling! </seg>
<seg id="353"> Playing with his identity disorder ... </seg>
<seg id="354"> Dr. Fletcher has skillfully pushed Zelig into a moment of disorientation. </seg>
<seg id="355"> As his defenses are lowered, he hypnotizes him immediately. </seg>
<seg id="356"> Using the post-hypnotic suggestion ... he will now be able to induce him in trance to his pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="357"> My brother beat me. </seg>
<seg id="358"> My sister beat my brother. </seg>
<seg id="359"> My father beat my sister and my brother and me. </seg>
<seg id="360"> My mother beat my father and sister and me and my brother. </seg>
<seg id="361"> The neighbors were killing the whole family. </seg>
<seg id="362"> Those of the other isolated beat our neighbors and our family. </seg>
<seg id="363"> I'm 12 years old. </seg>
<seg id="364"> I'm in a synagogue. </seg>
<seg id="365"> I ask the Rabbi the meaning of life. </seg>
<seg id="366"> He tells me the meaning of life ... but he explains it in Hebrew. </seg>
<seg id="367"> I do not understand Hebrew. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Then he wants $ 600 to give me Jewish lessons. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Dr. Fletcher's therapy consists of a two-way attack. </seg>
<seg id="370"> During the trance state, the personality will be ... deeply analyzed and restructured. In the conscious state ... she will give you love, affection ... and an unconditional respect. </seg>
<seg id="371"> You will be completely sincere. </seg>
<seg id="372"> You're in a deep trance. </seg>
<seg id="373"> You will not become what you believe I want you to be, but only yourself. </seg>
<seg id="374"> Tell me, what do you think about this accommodation? </seg>
<seg id="375"> It sucks. </seg>
<seg id="376"> I hate the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="377"> I hate grass and mosquitoes. </seg>
<seg id="378"> And the kitchen ... Your kitchen is terrible. </seg>
<seg id="379"> Your crêpe ... </seg>
<seg id="380"> I'm ... I throw it in the garbage every time you turn. </seg>
<seg id="381"> And those jokes you're trying to tell ... when you think you're funny ... they're long and meaningless, they never end. </seg>
<seg id="382"> I see. What else? </seg>
<seg id="383"> I want to come to bed with you. </seg>
<seg id="384"> It surprises me. I did not think I liked you a lot. </seg>
<seg id="385"> I love you. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Seriously? </seg>
<seg id="387"> You're so sweet, because ... you're not smart as you think you are. </seg>
<seg id="388"> You're confused ... and nervous, and you're a bad cook. </seg>
<seg id="389"> Those crêpe ... </seg>
<seg id="390"> Oh, I love you. </seg>
<seg id="391"> I want to take care of you. </seg>
<seg id="392"> Basta crêpe ... </seg>
<seg id="393"> I had started ... trying to use Leonard to make me a reputation. Then I found that I had strong feelings for him. </seg>
<seg id="394"> I never thought I was attractive. </seg>
<seg id="395"> I had never been in love really. </seg>
<seg id="396"> Charles Koslow was the kind of man ... my mother thought I should marry. </seg>
<seg id="397"> Feeling more confident with the patient ... Dr. Fletcher brings him out, with caution ... to spend an afternoon at his sister's house in the nearby Teaneck. </seg>
<seg id="398"> Meryl Fletcher is an avid ... an excellent professional pilot. </seg>
<seg id="399"> Eudora Fletcher is an amateur pilot ... and the afternoon runs fast while relaxing ... and they talk about old flight experiences. </seg>
<seg id="400"> As the weeks pass ... Zelig is encouraged to open more and more ... and to express his personal opinions. </seg>
<seg id="401"> Since it was early, it soon became expansive. </seg>
<seg id="402"> I hated my stepmother, and I'm afraid if you come to know. </seg>
<seg id="403"> I love baseball. </seg>
<seg id="404"> No matter what it means, it's just nice to see. </seg>
<seg id="405"> I am a Democrat. I've always been. </seg>
<seg id="406"> Are you sorry if I do not share your taste on that disc? </seg>
<seg id="407"> - Of course not. - You know, Brahms is always ... too melodramatic for me. </seg>
<seg id="408"> You have to be yourself and make your choices ... even when they require courage, or you're like a robot, or a lizard. </seg>
<seg id="409"> Will you really put that lawyer up? </seg>
<seg id="410"> I would prefer not to. </seg>
<seg id="411"> No, I do not agree. I think that Mussolini is a loser. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Will we ever make love? </seg>
<seg id="413"> Three months have passed ... and the hospital staff wants to examine the patient. </seg>
<seg id="414"> Dr. Fletcher says Zelig is not yet ready to leave. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Doctors decide to visit it on the spot. </seg>
<seg id="416"> The date is set: 4 days later. </seg>
<seg id="417"> If the progress becomes unsatisfactory ... they will take it away from its care. </seg>
<seg id="418"> I was very nervous because she was awake ... she did not remember anything about her trance state ... and I was wondering if there was a way ... to link the two events. </seg>
<seg id="419"> I was also afraid that ... putting him in front of strong personalities ... he could lose his. </seg>
<seg id="420"> The doctors arrive Sunday at noon. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Eudora Fletcher and Leonard Zelig ... welcome them and let them see their property. </seg>
<seg id="422"> Dr. Fletcher is tense and alarmed. </seg>
<seg id="423"> Leonard Zelig, however, seems calm and comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="424"> Despite being surrounded by doctors ... it does not turn into one of them. </seg>
<seg id="425"> The meeting seems to be a thrilling success ... until Dr. Henry Mayerson makes an innocent comment ... on time, saying it's a good day. </seg>
<seg id="426"> Zelig answers Dr Mayerson for not agreeing ... and that's not a good day. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Dr. Mayerson is surprised ... by the power of Zelig's conviction. </seg>
<seg id="428"> It points out that the sun shines and that the temperature is mild. </seg>
<seg id="429"> Zelig, accustomed to giving voice to his opinions without hesitation ... is too aggressive. It is too much conditioned in the opposite direction ... it has become stubborn about its views ... and it does not tolerate any divergence from its way of seeing. </seg>
<seg id="430"> I had pushed her too far in the opposite. </seg>
<seg id="431"> He struck Dr. Mayerson and other staff members ... with a rake. </seg>
<seg id="432"> It's not what we wanted ... yet I felt I got something. </seg>
<seg id="433"> If I had had it for another two weeks ... I would have perfected my techniques ... and let Leonard Zelig return himself. </seg>
<seg id="434"> Dr. Eudora Nesbit Fletcher, hero, indeed heroin, of the moment. </seg>
<seg id="435"> The beautiful, intelligent psychiatrist never doubted the fact ... that Leonard Zelig, the human chameleon, was suffering from mental illness. </seg>
<seg id="436"> Working with his cousin, filmmaker Paul Deghuee ... has recorded very important documentation ... which includes precious Zelig filming under hypnosis. </seg>
<seg id="437"> In the course of the care, the doctor and the patient have become friends ... and spend time together even outside the therapy. </seg>
<seg id="438"> The courage to uphold a minority opinion has led ... to a pompous success for psychiatry. </seg>
<seg id="439"> Who says that women are only brave to sew? </seg>
<seg id="440"> Let's go to the town hall where the heroes of the moment will receive the keys of the city. </seg>
<seg id="441"> We are honored to deliver you the keys to the city of New York. </seg>
<seg id="442"> Jimmy Walker wanted to be here with us ... and sing "Leonard the lizard" but was a bit too busy. </seg>
<seg id="443"> Then, Eudora Fletcher, the beautiful and ingenious doctor ... who healed Zelig from his enigmatic illness ... receives the honor of his fellow scientists at the Waldorf Astoria in New York. </seg>
<seg id="444"> There are luminaries all over the world, not just psychiatrists ... but also physicists, biologists, mathematicians and so on. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Here we see it discussing with Nils Andersen ... pioneer in the field of blood diseases. </seg>
<seg id="446"> He will then receive another recognition from the world's largest city ... when he will baptize his first ship. </seg>
<seg id="447"> A remarkable success for a country girl. </seg>
<seg id="448"> I'm talking to you from Mrs Catherine Fletcher's home ... Mother of Dr. Eudora Fletcher ... the famous psychiatrist who is on all newspapers. </seg>
<seg id="449"> I would like to ask Mrs. Fletcher ... first of all, to tell us what effect does a genius of medicine grow. And then I would like to talk about all the sacrifices made ... to fund his studies. </seg>
<seg id="450"> Please speak in the microphone, thank you. </seg>
<seg id="451"> We have not made any sacrifices. John was a stockbroker ... he had a lot of money, and I came from a wealthy Philadelphia family. </seg>
<seg id="452"> I'm sure his daughter has always wanted to be a doctor ... since she was a kid. </seg>
<seg id="453"> I would not say that. </seg>
<seg id="454"> I always thought she wanted to fly like her sister, and get a family ... - but she was a very grumpy little girl. - But surely every mother dreams ... that her little girl has the success of her daughter. </seg>
<seg id="455"> - It was a very difficult girl - Tell me about her husband ... </seg>
<seg id="456"> It turns out to be just a businessman. </seg>
<seg id="457"> Must be really excited ... </seg>
<seg id="458"> to see her daughter get similar awards ... </seg>
<seg id="459"> John had problems. Depression. And he drank. </seg>
<seg id="460"> Well, Mrs Fletcher, thank you very much for being with us today. </seg>
<seg id="461"> Here at San Simeon ... the fairy tales of print magnate William Randolph Hearst ... various famous people are tantalizing or tanning. </seg>
<seg id="462"> Here is Marie Dressler with Mr. Hearst. Always a very popular guest ... </seg>
<seg id="463"> Miss Dressler accepts a flower from an ardent admirer. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Along with her is Marion Davies. </seg>
<seg id="465"> When it comes to work, Miss Davies is always very serious ... but here, in this wonderful playground ... it demonstrates its spiritual side. </seg>
<seg id="466"> Here it is, with ... no less than Charlie Chaplin, always kidding. </seg>
<seg id="467"> Although New York is almost 5000 km away ... </seg>
<seg id="468"> Jimmy Walker looks like magic at Mr. Hearst's enchanted gate. </seg>
<seg id="469"> Another New Yorker is Leonard Zelig ... who is kidding with our favorite cowboy, Tom Mix. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Will not Tony be jealous of you? </seg>
<seg id="471"> Tony is Tom's horse, and we thought they were always together. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Here's the good Chaplin again this time with Adolphe Menjou. </seg>
<seg id="473"> Here's Claire Windsor and Dolores del Rio ... and a fascinating Eudora Fletcher ... who chats with Hollywood's latest star, James Cagney. </seg>
<seg id="474"> Oh, and who are we here? </seg>
<seg id="475"> A beautiful lady named Carole Lombard. </seg>
<seg id="476"> And down there we see Dr. Fletcher and Leonard Zelig ... who take a couple of strokes with Bobby Jones on Mr. Hearst's field. </seg>
<seg id="477"> Unless Leonard does not recover his chameleon personality ... and turns into a professional ... I'll bet my money on Bobby. </seg>
<seg id="478"> But what does it matter if they have fun? </seg>
<seg id="479"> Leonard, do you want to give some advice to the young people in this country? </seg>
<seg id="480"> Certainly. Guys, you have to be yourself. You can not imitate others ... just because you believe they have all the answers you are looking for. </seg>
<seg id="481"> You have to be yourself and learn to speak your voice aloud. </seg>
<seg id="482"> Perhaps in other countries can not be done, but this is America. </seg>
<seg id="483"> Believe me, because first I belonged to the reptile family ... but now no more. </seg>
<seg id="484"> Zelig, no longer a chameleon, is again himself. </seg>
<seg id="485"> His point of view on politics, art and love ... is sincere and sincere. </seg>
<seg id="486"> Although his tastes are described by many as mediocre ... they are his. </seg>
<seg id="487"> He is finally an individual, a human being. </seg>
<seg id="488"> He no longer abandons his identity ... to try to be a safe and invisible part of his environment. </seg>
<seg id="489"> His tastes were not so terrible. </seg>
<seg id="490"> It was the kind of person who preferred to watch baseball ... rather than reading "Moby Dick" ... and that was what made him a bad road ... at least, so does the legend. </seg>
<seg id="491"> It was more than a question of symbolism. For the Marxists, it represented a certain thing. </seg>
<seg id="492"> The Catholic Church never pardoned ... the Vatican accident. </seg>
<seg id="493"> The Americans ... with the Great Depression ... saw in him the symbol of the possibility ... of improvement, self-realization. </seg>
<seg id="494"> And of course, the Freudians looked at us ... they could interpret it as they wanted. </seg>
<seg id="495"> It was all symbolic, but there were not ... two intellectuals who agreed on the meaning. </seg>
<seg id="496"> I do not know if it can be called a triumph of psychotherapy. It is more than a triumph of aesthetic instincts. Dr. Fletcher's techniques had nothing ... at the therapy schools of then. </seg>
<seg id="497"> She knew what she needed and provided it. This was, in his own way, an extraordinary achievement. </seg>
<seg id="498"> If I think about it, it seems to me that his story ... reflects to a large extent the Jewish experience in America ... the great need to get wide, find his place ... and assimilate into culture. </seg>
<seg id="499"> He had a craving to assimilate. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Even Eudora Fletcher's life has changed ... from this experience. </seg>
<seg id="501"> For her, fame and recognition are reckless rewards ... and do not match the youth fantasies ... that have awakened her ambition. </seg>
<seg id="502"> She and her patient fell in love ... and it is no surprise to anyone that she leaves ... the ambitious lawyer Koslow ... and announces her wedding plans with Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="503"> It was great to see my sister and Leonard together. </seg>
<seg id="504"> He gave them strength ... and they were so in love ... and she seemed happier than she had been in so many years. </seg>
<seg id="505"> I remember that they decided to get married in the spring ... and then, of course ... it all ended up rolling. </seg>
<seg id="506"> Two weeks before the wedding ... an ex-souvenir named Lita Fox goes ahead ... and says she is married to Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="507"> He also says he had a son with him. </seg>
<seg id="508"> The scandal is immediate. </seg>
<seg id="509"> We got married a year ago. He told me he was an actor. </seg>
<seg id="510"> It seemed credible, and I'm also in the world of entertainment. </seg>
<seg id="511"> So we went to Baltimore and married ... and here I have the license that proves it. </seg>
<seg id="512"> He had married her under another personality. </seg>
<seg id="513"> When she read about her upcoming marriage with Eudora Fletcher ... she had been mortified and had decided to sue. </seg>
<seg id="514"> Zelig announces that he will fight in court ... but public opinion begins to turn his face. </seg>
<seg id="515"> Attractive lawyers paint Lita Fox as an abandoned woman. </seg>
<seg id="516"> The child is neglected, poor and without father. </seg>
<seg id="517"> Zelig has sold Hollywood's story to Hollywood ... for a large sum of money. </seg>
<seg id="518"> When the scandal bursts ... the studios ask for money back. </seg>
<seg id="519"> Zelig can only return half of it. The rest was spent. </seg>
<seg id="520"> Scandalized, the studios only give him half of his life. They keep the best moments ... and only the hours of sleep and meals remain. </seg>
<seg id="521"> Zelig is shaken by scandal, but this is just the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="522"> Now another woman comes forward: Helen Gray, a commissar at a Winsconsin souvenir shop ... says Zelig is the father of his two twins. </seg>
<seg id="523"> She says to lawyers who had come up as a furry hunter. </seg>
<seg id="524"> Zelig does not remember, but admits ... that may have happened during one of his metamorphoses. </seg>
<seg id="525"> It is the drop that overflows the vessel. </seg>
<seg id="526"> He married me in the Harlem church. </seg>
<seg id="527"> He told me to be Duke Ellington's brother. </seg>
<seg id="528"> It's the guy who has driven me off the car. It was brand new. </seg>
<seg id="529"> Then he put the back and passed on my mother's wrist. </seg>
<seg id="530"> It's old and uses a lot of wrist. </seg>
<seg id="531"> He painted the house of an obscene color. He said he was a painter. When I saw the result I did not believe in my eyes. Then he disappeared. </seg>
<seg id="532"> What Zelig is responsible for ... the behaviors of each of the personalities he has taken ... means for him only one thing: dozens of complaints. </seg>
<seg id="533"> He is sued for bigotry, adultery ... car accidents, plagiarism, domestic accidents ... negligence, property damage, property damage ... and for performing unnecessary extraction of teeth. </seg>
<seg id="534"> I would like to apologize to everyone. </seg>
<seg id="535"> I'm terribly sorry to have married all those women. </seg>
<seg id="536"> It's just ... I do not know, I thought it was the right thing. </seg>
<seg id="537"> And to the lord to whom I removed the appendage ... no ... I do not know what to say. </seg>
<seg id="538"> If it can comfort her, I still have her home somewhere. </seg>
<seg id="539"> My deeper apologies go to the Trokman family in Detroit. </seg>
<seg id="540"> I never gave birth to a baby ... and I thought the ice pincers were the right tool. </seg>
<seg id="541"> By leveraging on mercy and legal technical skills ... American attorneys have their time of glory. </seg>
<seg id="542"> Zelig is branded as a criminal. Despite Dr. Fletcher's insistence that Zelig can not ... be held responsible for his actions in his chameleon state ... it's all worthless. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Leonard Zelig is a bad example for the nation's morale. America is a morally right country. God's Timorate. </seg>
<seg id="544"> We do not forgive scandals ... scandals of fraud and polygamy. </seg>
<seg id="545"> In the name of the principles of a pure society ... I say, we lick that miserable Jew! </seg>
<seg id="546"> During this humiliating trial ... Eudora Fletcher stands bravely beside the man she loves. </seg>
<seg id="547"> In private, trusts friends ... to be worried about Zelig's emotional conditions ... that seem to deteriorate ... under the weight of common morals. </seg>
<seg id="548"> In public, Zelig tries to prove master of himself ... but it is getting harder. </seg>
<seg id="549"> It is clear that he is going to pieces ... when he and Eudora dine in a Greek restaurant and ... mid-dinner, Zelig begins to turn into a Greek. </seg>
<seg id="550"> Desperately desires to be again welcome ... accepted, inserted. </seg>
<seg id="551"> The clamor of the public on her morality reaches paroxysm ... and on the eve of the sentence ... Leonard Zelig disappears. </seg>
<seg id="552"> Chief Inspector Thomas Dowd speaks ... in a nationwide press release. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Leonard Zelig has disappeared. On the eve of his sentence ... for a set of crimes and misdeeds ... ranging from polygamy to fraud, he was stained. </seg>
<seg id="554"> We are looking for clues and we would appreciate the contribution of anyone ... have information that can lead to his capture. </seg>
<seg id="555"> My sister was literally torn apart. </seg>
<seg id="556"> He was trying to keep calm ... but he was just ... shocked. </seg>
<seg id="557"> And it was not even the kind of person ... who usually shows his feelings ... except for what Leonard meant. </seg>
<seg id="558"> Dr Fletcher and the police are in daily contact. By common accord, they make public calls ... to anyone who can provide some news. </seg>
<seg id="559"> Apart from some absurd calls ... they do not get anything. </seg>
<seg id="560"> The months pass and Zelig has no trace. </seg>
<seg id="561"> Cars are searched. False clues raining from everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="562"> His jacket is found in Texas ... where a hunting man turns out to be useless. </seg>
<seg id="563"> They say they saw him in Chicago, California. </seg>
<seg id="564"> In this photo of a Marian music group in Mexico ... there is a man who seems to resemble him. </seg>
<seg id="565"> Dr. Fletcher continues to look for Zelig ... but hope fades away every day more. </seg>
<seg id="566"> I could only think about Leonard ... to what I missed and how much I loved her ... and to all the wonderful moments she had spent together. </seg>
<seg id="567"> These days were really painful for me. </seg>
<seg id="568"> The year ends and Zelig is still unavailable. </seg>
<seg id="569"> I was just dragging me here and there and crying. </seg>
<seg id="570"> And one evening after a particularly bad time ... my sister Meryl told me ... "Come on, we go out for dinner or a concert" ... I said, "No, I can not do it" but she insisted. </seg>
<seg id="571"> We got out and finally we went to see a movie. </seg>
<seg id="572"> We saw "Grand Hotel" and there was also a news event. </seg>
<seg id="573"> Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist Party ... gain ground in a Berlin hit by depression. </seg>
<seg id="574"> Denouncing the Treaty of Versailles ... the Nazis leverage German patriotism. </seg>
<seg id="575"> Eudora Fletcher remains silent. </seg>
<seg id="576"> In the midst of the Nazis ... he sees a person who might be Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="577"> In fact, the thing was meaningful ... because although he wanted to be loved ... he wanted to be loved ... there was something in him ... that he wanted to disappear in the mass, in the general anonymity. And fascism offers Zelig this kind of possibilities ... so that he can make himself anonymous ... belonging to this vast mass movement. </seg>
<seg id="578"> The doctor embarks for Europe the following week ... and ten days after arriving in Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="579"> Germany is a country in deep economic crisis. </seg>
<seg id="580"> They breathe militarism and anxiety. </seg>
<seg id="581"> She searches everywhere and asks for information ... but there is nothing to do. </seg>
<seg id="582"> After three weeks ... the authorities begin to feel suspicious. </seg>
<seg id="583"> They keep an eye on her. As he is out, he searches for his hotel room. </seg>
<seg id="584"> You spend a fourth week ... and she is about to give up and go home ... when the news of a big comedy in Munich hits her attention. </seg>
<seg id="585"> It is said to be ... the biggest gathering of Nazis ever happened. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Eudora Fletcher counts on hope ... that Zelig takes part and that, meeting her, the strong feelings ... she has always felt for her to be awakened. </seg>
<seg id="587"> At first, there does not seem to be hope. The crowd is immense. It seems impossible to be able to isolate a single face. Then suddenly a figure beside the Chancellor ... draws his attention. </seg>
<seg id="588"> Behind Hitler, on the right, recognizes Zelig. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Striving to establish a contact, he tries to cross his gaze. </seg>
<seg id="590"> Like a man awakening from a dream, Zelig notes. </seg>
<seg id="591"> In a flash, he comes back to himself. </seg>
<seg id="592"> It was not like the movie. </seg>
<seg id="593"> When Leonard got off the podium, they did not know what to think. </seg>
<seg id="594"> We did not believe in our eyes. Hitler's speech was ruined. </seg>
<seg id="595"> He wanted to make a joke about Poland ... but right then Zelig intrigued ... and Hitler was extremely upset. </seg>
<seg id="596"> The SS wanted to capture Zelig ... and if they took it ... they would probably have tortured him ... or maybe even killed. </seg>
<seg id="597"> So in general confusion ... Dr. Fletcher and Zelig left the building ... from a side door. </seg>
<seg id="598"> They took a car and they escaped ... and the SS, behind, fired. </seg>
<seg id="599"> In a rare German news story ... we can see some images of the escape. </seg>
<seg id="600"> I was flying a plane. It was wonderful. And then, suddenly, something happened. I was scared and lost control. We were rushing. </seg>
<seg id="601"> Leonard was so terrified that he changed his personality ... and since I was a pilot at that time ... he also turned him into a pilot. </seg>
<seg id="602"> Zelig takes control of the plane. By interpreting the role of a pilot ... Zelig struggles boldly to control the device. </seg>
<seg id="603"> The Germans, astonished, take us a quarter of an hour ... before arranging for a chase. </seg>
<seg id="604"> While Eudora Fletcher is senseless ... Zelig, who has never driven a plane in his life ... not only manages to escape the German pilots ... but also establishes a record, crossing the Atlantic without a stop .. . upside down. </seg>
<seg id="605"> New York celebrates Eudora Fletcher ... and Leonard Zelig, the human chameleon. </seg>
<seg id="606"> His incredible flight fills the country with pride ... and guarantees the presidential amnesty. </seg>
<seg id="607"> The crowds flock to see him next to her courageous bride promise. </seg>
<seg id="608"> Their triumphal journey ends at the City Hall. </seg>
<seg id="609"> New York City's Value Medal ... is conferred on Zelig by Carter Dean. </seg>
<seg id="610"> You are a great inspiration for the young people of this country ... who will grow one day and will be great doctors and large patients. </seg>
<seg id="611"> It's a big emotion. </seg>
<seg id="612"> I'm glad we've been alive here. </seg>
<seg id="613"> I had never done it before. It shows you what you can do ... if you're completely psychotic. </seg>
<seg id="614"> The thing is paradoxical ... because what had allowed him to accomplish this incredible enterprise ... was precisely his ability to transform. </seg>
<seg id="615"> So his illness was also the basis of his salvation ... and I find it interesting to see her in this perspective. It was his disturbance to make him a hero. </seg>
<seg id="616"> In a way it was really absurd. </seg>
<seg id="617"> I mean, he had this curious gift ... this strange feature. And for a while they all loved him ... then, people got tired of him. At that point he did that business with the plane ... and again everyone wanted to. The 1920s were basically the same. </seg>
<seg id="618"> And, if you think so well, has it changed so much, America? I do not think so. </seg>
<seg id="619"> After getting rid of infinite legal details ... </seg>
<seg id="620"> Leonard Zelig and Eudora Fletcher marry. </seg>
<seg id="621"> It's a simple ceremony, shot in amateur movies. </seg>
<seg id="622"> "Just wanting to do it well, transformed itself ..." beyond any measure, "Scott Fitzgerald wrote. </seg>
<seg id="623"> "You wonder what would happen if, from the beginning ..." he had the courage to express himself instead of pretending. </seg>
<seg id="624"> "After all, it was not the approval of the masses ..." but the love of a woman, what changed her life " </seg>
