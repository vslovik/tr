(CROWD CHEERING AND WHISTLING)

2
00:00:35,286 --> 00:00:37,746
He was the phenomenon of the '20s.

3
00:00:38,414 --> 00:00:41,759
When you think, at the time, he was
as well-known as Lindbergh,

4
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:42,924
it's really quite astonishing.

5

(CROWD CHEERING)

6
00:00:46,297 --> 00:00:49,547
<i>His story reflected
the nature of our civilization,</i>

7
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,886
<i>the character of our times,</i>

8
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,346
yet it was also one man's story.

9
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,730
And all the themes of our culture
were there.

10
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:01,439
Heroism, will, things like that.

11
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:04,652
But when you look back on it,
it was very strange.

12
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:12,525
<i>Well, it is ironic to see
how quickly he has faded from memory,</i>

13
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:15,622
considering what
an astounding record he made.

14
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:21,749
He was, of course, very amusing, but at
the same time touched a nerve in people,

15
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:27,172
perhaps in a way in which
they would prefer not to be touched.

16
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:30,336
It certainly is a very bizarre story.

When I first heard about this
emergency case that had been brought in,

92
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:35,726
I didn't think anything peculiar.

93
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:40,398
And when I first laid eyes on him,
it was a bit strange,

94
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:43,741
because I mistook him for a doctor.

95
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:47,028

FLETCHER: <i>It's not that
he was making any sense at all.</i>

110
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:33,657
<i>It was just a conglomeration
of psychological double-talk</i>

111

<i>that he had apparently heard, or perhaps
was familiar with through reading.</i>

112
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,545
<i>The funny thing was
that his delivery was quite fluid,</i>

113

<i>and might have been really
quite convincing</i>

117
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:56,360
<i>All that was known of him was that

<i>side with the anti-Semites.</i>

126

<i>On his deathbed,
Morris Zelig tells his son</i>

129
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:44,687
<i>that life is a meaningless
nightmare of suffering,</i>

130
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:48,702
<i>and the only advice

<i>Leonard Zelig appears

134
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,504
<i>Somehow, he seems to have coped.</i>

135
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:07,086
<i>And then, suddenly,
increasingly strange behavior.</i>

136
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,971
<i>Fascinated by the Zelig phenomenon,</i>

137
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,643
<i>Dr. Fletcher arranges
a series of experiments</i>

139
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:24,153
<i>With the doctors watching,
Zelig becomes a perfect psychiatrist.</i>

140
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,784
<i>When two Frenchmen are brought in,</i>

141
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:31,489
<i>Zelig assumes their characters
and speaks reasonable French.</i>

142
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:37,697
<i>In the company of a Chinese person,
he begins to develop oriental features.</i>

143
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,749
<i>By now, word has gotten out to the press,</i>

144
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:46,632
<i>and a public thirsting for thrills
and novelty is immediately captivated.</i>

145
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:55,851
<i>The clamor is so great that Dr. Allan
Sindell is forced to issue a statement.</i>

146
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,604
We're just beginning
to realize the dimensions

147
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:02,522
of what could be the scientific
medical phenomenon of the age,

148
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,353
and possibly of all time.

149
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,355
NARRATOR:
<i>Fresh stories roll off the press every day</i>

150
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,651
<i>about Zelig and his puzzling condition.</i>

151
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:14,197
<i>Although the doctors claim
to have the situation in hand,</i>

152
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:16,913
<i>no two can agree on a diagnosis.</i>

153
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,670
I'm convinced
that it's glandular in nature

154
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:22,115
and although there's no evidence now
of any misfunction,

155
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:25,748
I'm sure that further tests
will show a problem in the secretions.

156
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,881
I'm certain it's something
he picked up from eating Mexican food.

157
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:32,417
This manifestation
is neurological in origin.

158
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,510
Now, this patient
is suffering from a brain tumor,

159
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,220
and I should not be surprised if,
within several weeks, he died.

160
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:43,354
Now, we have not as yet
been able to locate the tumor,

161
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:45,685
but we're still looking.

162
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,730
NARRATOR:
<i>Ironically, within two weeks' time,</i>

163
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:53,357
<i>it is Dr. Birsky himself
who dies of a brain tumor.</i>

164
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,909
<i>Leonard Zelig is fine.</i>

165
00:10:57,282 --> 00:11:00,202
<i>Throughout the weeks
of testing and speculation,</i>

166
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:04,205
<i>Eudora Fletcher begins to feel
that the patient might be suffering</i>

167
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:06,669
<i>not from a physiological disorder,</i>

168
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,590
<i>but from a psychological one.</i>

169
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,296
<i>It is Zelig's unstable make-up,
she suggests,</i>

170
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:14,966
<i>that accounts for his metamorphoses.</i>

171
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:18,715
<i>The governing board of doctors
is hostile to her notion.</i>

172
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:23,812
<i>They conclude that Zelig's malady can be
traced to poor alignment of the vertebrae.</i>

173
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:28,938
<i>Tests prove them wrong, and cause
a temporary problem for the patient.</i>

174
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:35,954
<i>Now, the press and public
hang on every bit of news,</i>

175
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:38,783
<i>thoroughly absorbed
in the real-life drama.</i>

176
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,203
MAN: (ON RADIO) <i>The continuing saga
of the strange creature</i>

177
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,785
<i>at Manhattan Hospital goes on.</i>

178
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:46,334
<i>This morning, doctors report,
experiments were conducted</i>

179
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:50,286
<i>and several women of varying types were
placed in close proximity to the subject,</i>

180
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:53,259
<i>but no change occurred,
leading authorities to conclude</i>

181
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,720
<i>that the phenomenon
does not occur with women.</i>

182
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:59,723
<i>Later today, doctors will be experimenting
with a midget and a chicken.</i>

183

MAN: (ON NEWSREEL) <i>Leonard Zelig
continues to astound scientists</i>

184
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:11,818
<i>at New York's Manhattan Hospital,</i>

185
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:14,117
<i>where numerous tests have led nowhere</i>

186
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:17,202
<i>in determining the nature of
this astonishing manifestation.</i>

187
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:21,909
<i>He is confronted by two overweight men
at the request of the doctors.</i>

188
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:26,995
<i>As the men discuss their obesity,
an initially reticent Zelig joins in,</i>

189
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:31,330
<i>swelling himself to
a miraculous 250 pounds.</i>

190
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,670
<i>Next, in the presence of two Negro men,</i>

191
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,510
<i>Zelig rapidly becomes one himself.</i>

192
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,839
<i>What will they think of next?</i>

193
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:45,064
<i>Meanwhile, Americans all over
have their own reactions.</i>

194
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:49,019
I wish I could be
Lenny Zelig, the changing man.

195
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,559
I'd be different people, and maybe
someday my wishes will come true.

196
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:57,778
Leonard Zelig is
one of the finest gentlemen

197
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:00,201
in the United States of America!

198
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:03,073
He is the cat's pajamas!

199
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:06,002
NARRATOR:
<i>Trying a new approach, Dr. Fletcher</i>

200
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:08,037
<i>places the subject under hypnosis.</i>

201
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:12,792
FLETCHER:
<i>Tell me why you assume the characteristics</i>

202
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,376
<i>of the person you're with.</i>

203
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,415
ZELIG: (SLEEPILY) <i>It's safe.</i>

204
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:19,633
FLETCHER: <i>What do you mean?
What do you mean, "safe"?</i>

205
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,432
ZELIG: <i>Safe to...</i>

206
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,467
<i>To be like the others.</i>

207
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,772
FLETCHER: <i>Mmm-hmm. You want to be safe?</i>

208
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:35,072
- ZELIG: <i>I wanna be liked.</i>
- FLETCHER: <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

209
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:40,068
NARRATOR: <i>Probing Zelig's unconscious,
Dr. Fletcher gradually puts together</i>

210
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,953
<i>the pieces of Zelig's behavioral puzzle.</i>

211
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:48,159
<i>Dividing her time between the hospital
and the 42nd Street library,</i>

212
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,620
<i>she writes her report.</i>

213
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:52,672
<i>A closed meeting of doctors listens</i>

214
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:57,296
<i>as Dr. Fletcher describes Zelig
as "a human chameleon."</i>

215
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:02,925
<i>Like the lizard that is endowed by nature
with a marvelous protective device</i>

216
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:07,263
<i>that enables it to change color and
blend in with its immediate surrounding,</i>

217
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:11,891
<i>Zelig, too, protects himself
by becoming whoever he is around.</i>

218
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:15,306
<i>The doctors listen,
and their reaction is skeptical.</i>

219
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,482
<i>"Impossible!" they claim."Preposterous!"</i>

220
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:21,027
<i>"If he's a lizard," quips one doctor,</i>

221
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:24,071
<i>"then we should not spend
good hospital money feeding him,</i>

222
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,954
<i>"but simply catch him some flies."</i>

223
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:41,007
We knew we had a good story
this time 'cause it had everything in it.

224
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,974
It had romance and it had suspense.

225
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:47,137
And then this fella, Zelig,
you know, he grew up poor.

226
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,564
I remember my city editor came to me.

227
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:53,639
He said "Ted, we want this story
on page one every day."

228
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:57,059
And in those days,
you'd do anything to sell papers.

229
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:03,145
To get a story, you'd jazz it up, exaggerate,
even maybe play with the truth a little bit.

230
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:05,988
But here was a story. It was a natural.

231
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:09,953
You just told the truth and it sold papers.
It never happened before.

232
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,463
NARRATOR:
<i>Overnight, Leonard Zelig has become</i>

233
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,828
<i>the main topic of conversation everywhere,</i>

234
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,416
<i>and is discussed
with amusement and wonder.</i>

235
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,875
<i>No social gathering
is without its Leonard Zelig joke,</i>

236
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:26,380
<i>and in a decade of popular dance crazes,
a new one sweeps the nation.</i>

237
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:29,097
MAN: (SINGING)
<i>There's a brand-new dance come up the river</i>

238
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,273
<i>Just jerk your head and shake your liver</i>

239
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:34,308
<i>You're doin' the Chameleon</i>

240
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:38,095
<i>Fo-do-do-de-oh,
make a face that's like a lizard</i>

241
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:40,358
<i>And feel that beat down in your gizzard</i>

242
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,490
<i>You're doin' the Chameleon</i>

243
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:44,823
<i>Ah!</i>

244
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,565
<i>Stick out your tongue
the way the reptiles do</i>

245
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:49,526
<i>Tryin' to catch a fly</i>

246
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:52,002
<i>Inflate your lungs like big crocodiles do</i>

247
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:54,287
<i>Hey, hey, my oh my</i>

248
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:56,541
<i>Throw your best gal down
right on the floor</i>

249
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,423
<i>She'll be beggin' you for more</i>

250
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,420
<i>And you're doin' the Chameleon</i>

251
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:05,216
<i>If you hold your breath till you turn blue</i>

252
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,428
<i>You'll be changing colors like they do</i>

253
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:10,509
<i>When you're doin' the Chameleon</i>

254
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:14,308
<i>Fo-do-do-de-oh, wiggle like a salamander</i>

255
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:16,484
<i>Go this way, that way, all meander</i>

256
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,599
<i>You're doin' the Chameleon</i>

257
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,016
<i>Ah!</i>

258
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,726
<i>Stick out your tongue
the way the reptiles do</i>

259
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,777
<i>Tryin' to catch a fly</i>

00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,279
<i>Inflate your lungs like big crocodiles do</i>

00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,283
<i>Hey, hey, my oh my</i>

262
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,834
<i>Shake your shoulders,
move your seat around</i>

263
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,119
<i>Get right down and kick your feet around</i>

264
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:39,923
<i>Doin' the Chameleon, fo-de-oh-do</i>

265
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,747
What's brown and white
and yellow and has four eyes?

266
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,129
Leonard Zelig at the League of Nations.

267
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:50,761
NARRATOR: <i>Not everyone, however,
was entranced by the human chameleon,</i>

268
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:54,257
<i>and amongst the fanatics,
he was a handy symbol of iniquity.</i>

269
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:58,938
MAN:
This creature personifies capitalist man!

270
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:05,241
A creature who takes many forms
to achieve ends,

271
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:09,696
the exploitation
of the workers by deception.

272
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:15,085
NARRATOR:
<i>To the Ku Klux Klan, Zelig, a Jew</i>

273
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,370
<i>who was able to transform himself
into a Negro or Indian,</i>

274
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,371
<i>was a triple threat.</i>

275
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:26,127
<i>Meanwhile, Dr. Fletcher,
certain that her findings are correct,</i>

276
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:29,971
<i>begs for time with her patient
to put her theories into operation.</i>

277
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,548
FLETCHER: <i>Do you recall the first time</i>

278
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,846
<i>you began behaving like the
people you were around?</i>

279
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:41,273
ZELIG: <i>In school, some very bright people</i>

280
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,270
<i>asked me if I read</i> Moby Dick.

281
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:45,856
FLETCHER: <i>Yes?</i>

282
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,150
ZELIG:
<i>I was ashamed to say I never read it.</i>

283
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,065
- FLETCHER: <i>And you pretended?</i>
- ZELIG: <i>Yes.</i>

284
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,120
FLETCHER: <i>When did the changes
begin happening automatically?</i>

285
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:59,329
ZELIG: <i>Years ago. St. Patrick's Day.</i>

286
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:03,786
<i>Wandered into a bar. Wasn't wearing green.</i>

287
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:09,085
<i>They made remarks. I turned Irish.</i>

288
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:10,919
FLETCHER: <i>You told them you were Irish?</i>

289
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,800
ZELIG:
<i>My hair turned red, my nose turned up.</i>

290
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:21,273
<i>Spoke about the great potato famine
and the little people.</i>

291
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,360
We do not agree with Dr. Fletcher's ideas.

292
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:29,193
We believe those ideas are pipe dreams.

293
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:32,396
We believe that any change
in Zelig's condition

294
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:35,367
is going to be brought about
through certain experimental drugs,

295
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:38,991
which, although risky,
have been known to work wonders.

296
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:44,081
NARRATOR: <i>Zelig is treated with
the experimental drug Somadril hydrate.</i>

297
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,379
<i>He undergoes severe mood changes,</i>

298
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:50,304
<i>and for several days
will not come off the wall.</i>

299
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:56,679
<i>Then, suddenly, as Dr. Fletcher
is beginning to make some progress,</i>

300
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,560
<i>the question of Zelig's fate
takes a new twist</i>

301
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:04,271
<i>as his half-sister, Ruth, shocks everyone
by removing him from the hospital.</i>

302
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:07,521
<i>He can be better cared for at home,
she tells the doctors.</i>

303
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:12,147
<i>He will be looked after, she explains,
by her and her dubious-looking lover,</i>

304
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,490
<i>Martin Geist, a businessman
and ex-carnival promoter.</i>

305
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:19,532
<i>There is very little resistance
amongst the doctors,</i>

306
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:22,369
<i>who are relieved
to be rid of the frustrating case.</i>

307
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:26,081
<i>Only Dr. Fletcher cares
about Zelig as a human being.</i>

308
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:31,549
<i>She insists he desperately needs
special care, but it is to no avail.</i>

309
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:35,558
No, no one was questioning
her legal right to Zelig,

310
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,933
I mean, she was his half-sister
and his guardian,

311
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:41,933
but she had a strange
boyfriend called Geist

312
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,690
<i>that... He'd been in jail
for real-estate fraud.</i>

313
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:49,648
He was selling the same piece of property
to a lot of the same people, and...

314
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:53,357
Matter of fact, a congressman
from Delaware bought it twice.

315
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,414
NARRATOR: <i>The crowds that lined
the roads to glimpse the human chameleon</i>

316
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,199
<i>tie up traffic for days.</i>

317
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:03,580
<i>He is a sight to behold
for tourists and children.</i>

318
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:08,748
<i>People from all over the country fight for
space to peek at this new wonderment.</i>

319
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:22,438
<i>Selling mementos while her brother

320
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:25,603
<i>is only the beginning
for Ruth Zelig and Martin Geist.</i>

321
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:28,979
<i>Admission is charged
to twice-daily demonstrations</i>

322
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:31,232
<i>of Leonard's stunning prowess.</i>

323
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:36,154
<i>He does not disappoint, changing
appearance over and over upon demand.</i>

324
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:41,866
<i>Overnight, he has become
an attraction, a novelty, a freak.</i>

325
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:49,752
<i>In this 1935 film based on the life
of Zelig, called</i> The Changing Man,

326
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,336
<i>the atmosphere is best summed up.</i>

327
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,210
We can't give up custody of Leonard.

328
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:56,806
I know if I'm given the chance,
I can cure him.

329
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:59,631
It's no use.
Even our attorney says it's hopeless.

330
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,102
Really, Dr. Fletcher.

331
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,467
Uh... May I call you Eudora?

332
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:08,318
I tell you, somewhere behind
that vacuous face, that zombie-like stare,

333
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:11,063
is a real human being,
and I can bring it out.

334
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:13,359
- How?
- I'll think up some new way.

335
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:17,443
Some technique. Whatever it is,
it'll have to be personal.

336
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:19,954
There's not much I can do legally.
I'll try, but...

337
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,699
They don't care about him.
They'll exploit him.

338
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,872
All they see in him is a chance
to make more money. Look at this.

339
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,369
Already they're selling
this Leonard Zelig doll.

340
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:32,842
NARRATOR: <i>The film did not exaggerate.
There were not only Leonard Zelig pens</i>

341
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:35,470
<i>and lucky charms, but clocks and toys.</i>

342
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:39,545
<i>There were Leonard Zelig watches and
books, and a famous Leonard Zelig doll.</i>

343
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:42,302
<i>There were aprons,
chameleon-shaped earmuffs</i>

344
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:44,387
<i>and a popular Leonard Zelig game.</i>

345
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,055
WOMAN: (SINGING) <i>Everybody go chameleon</i>

346
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,941
<i>Everybody show chameleon</i>

347
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:56,522
<i>Take it fast or slow chameleon,
chameleon, chameleon days</i>

348
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:59,108
<i>Everybody think chameleon</i>

349
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,895
<i>Every time you blink, chameleon</i>

350
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:07,413
<i>In your kitchen sink, chameleon,
chameleon, chameleon days</i>

351
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:11,617
<i>They're so much fun,
they'll even jump right through a hoop</i>

352
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,549
<i>Oh, boy!</i>

353
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:17,304
<i>And they change color
when they're swimming in your soup</i>

354
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:18,762
<i>Boo-boop-be-doop</i>

355
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,128
<i>Flying in the air, chameleon</i>

356
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,893
<i>Crawling in your hair, chameleon</i>

357
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:29,388
<i>Take away all your care,
chameleon, chameleon, chameleon days</i>

358
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,270
NARRATOR: <i>There were many popular
songs inspired by Leonard Zelig,</i>

359
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:36,484
<i>tunes that swept the nation.</i>

360
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:42,485
MAN: (SINGING) <i>I want you for myself alone</i>

361
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:48,028
MEN: (SINGING) <i>Leonard the Lizard,
see him running across the floor</i>

362
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,197
<i>See him skittering out the door</i>

363
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:55,173
WOMAN: (SINGING)
<i>You have such reptile eyes</i>

364
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:59,709
<i>Eyes like a lizard that weave their spell</i>

365
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:03,125
NARRATOR: <i>In addition to
the products and endorsements,</i>

366
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:05,256
<i>there are the endless exhibitions.</i>

367
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,560
<i>In Hollywood, he is a great favorite
and is offered a film contract.</i>

368
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:12,476
<i>Clara Bow invites him
for a private weekend,</i>

369
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:15,653
<i>and tells him to bring
all his personalities.</i>

370
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:19,574
<i>In Chicago, he meets
heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey,</i>

371
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:22,276
<i>who clowns with Zelig
at his training camp.</i>

372
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:28,032
<i>In Washington, DC, he is introduced to
both Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover.</i>

373
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:33,786
<i>In France he is hailed as "Le Lézard." He
is the toast of the Parisian music halls.</i>

374
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:38,075
<i>His performance endears him as well
to many leading French intellectuals,</i>

375
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:41,002
<i>who see in him a symbol for everything.</i>

376
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:46,181
<i>His transformation
into a rabbi is so realistic</i>

377
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:49,761
<i>that certain Frenchmen suggest
he be sent to Devil's Island.</i>

378
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:58,353
<i>At the Folies-Bergère, Josephine Baker
does her version of the Chameleon dance,</i>

379
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:03,276
<i>and later tells friends
she finds Zelig amazing, but a little lost.</i>

380
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:09,365
Everyone used to be at my place,
that is, everyone who was someone.

381
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:15,118
And occasionally, someone would bring

382
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,460
Zelig in... Leonard in.

383
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:21,714
Cole Porter was fascinated by Leonard,

384
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:25,205
and he once wrote a line in a song...

385
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:30,046
Uh..."You're the tops,
you're Leonard Zelig."

386
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:34,676
But then he couldn't find
anything to rhyme with "Zelig."

387
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,068
<i>I'm flyin' high</i>

388
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:47,355
<i>'Cause I've got a feelin' I'm fallin'</i>

389
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:52,447
<i>Fallin' for nobody else but you</i>

390
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,750
<i>You caught my eye</i>

391
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:58,788
<i>Now I got a feelin' I'm fallin'</i>

392
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:03,837
<i>Show me that ring
and I'll jump right through</i>

393
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:07,883
<i>I used to travel single, oh</i>

394
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:10,635
<i>We chanced to mingle, oh</i>

395
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:14,595
<i>Now I'm a-tingle over you</i>

396
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:18,942
<i>Hey, Mr. Zelig, stand by</i>

397
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:22,694
<i>'Cause I've got a feelin' I'm fallin'</i>

398
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:28,693
<i>Fallin' for nobody else but you, wow!</i>

399
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:32,248
NARRATOR: <i>Though the shows
and parties keep Zelig's sister</i>

400
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:33,953
<i>and her lover rich and amused,</i>

401
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:37,785
<i>Zelig's own existence is a nonexistence.</i>

402
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:43,288
<i>Devoid of personality, his human qualities
long since lost in the shuffle of life,</i>

403
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:46,749
<i>he sits alone, quietly staring into space,</i>

404
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:51,131
<i>a cipher, a non-person,
a performing freak.</i>

405
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:55,346
<i>He who wanted only to fit in, to belong,</i>

406
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:58,636
<i>to go unseen by his enemies and be loved,</i>

407
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:03,272
<i>neither fits in nor belongs,
is supervised by enemies,</i>

408
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:05,823
<i>and remains uncared for.</i>

409
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:10,153
<i>The board at the hospital
has all but forgotten Zelig.</i>

410
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:13,822
<i>Only Dr. Fletcher continues
to fight for his custody.</i>

411
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:17,412
<i>The court turns her final appeal down.</i>

412
00:26:18,661 --> 00:26:20,541
<i>Throughout her valiant legal battle,</i>

413
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:23,955
<i>she is frequently in the company
of her attorney, Charles Koslow.</i>

414
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:28,667
<i>He falls in love with her
and presses for her hand in marriage.</i>

415
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,259
<i>She is ambivalent.</i>

416
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:36,511
<i>Reluctantly, she is beginning to abandon
all hope of recovering Leonard Zelig.</i>

417
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:42,385
<i>That summer,
Geist has booked them in Spain.</i>

418
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:47,185
<i>It is the last leg of a European tour
that has been wildly successful.</i>

419
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:52,649
<i>Relations between Martin Geist
and Ruth Zelig have grown strained.</i>

420
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:56,735
<i>They have become bored
with one another, and quarrel frequently.</i>

421
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:01,325
<i>The situation grows worse
when she meets Luis Martinez,</i>

422
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:05,752
<i>a mediocre and cowardly bullfighter
with whom she falls in love.</i>

423
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:10,346
<i>Though he wishes to impress Ruth Zelig,</i>

424
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:13,721
<i>Martinez displays
his usual panic in the arena.</i>

425
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:18,465
<i>Good fortune is with him, however, as
the bull gives himself a brain concussion.</i>

426
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:22,731
<i>Martinez takes credit for the kill,
and, cutting off the bull's ear,</i>

427
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:25,693
<i>presents it to his lover
with great bravado.</i>

428
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:31,073
<i>That evening, in a jealous rage,
Martin Geist returns to his hotel room</i>

429
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:35,743
<i>and confronts Ruth Zelig.
He demands that she give him the ear.</i>

430
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:40,197
<i>She refuses. Geist insists
upon possession of the ear.</i>

431
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:44,706
<i>They quarrel furiously, and Martinez
is discovered hiding in the closet.</i>

432
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:47,214
<i>Geist pulls a revolver and shoots him.</i>

433
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:53,013
<i>He turns the gun on Zelig's half-sister
and kills her, then he takes his own life.</i>

434
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:55,796
<i>In an orgy of jealous violence,</i>

435
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:59,303
<i>Leonard Zelig's life
is turned upside down.</i>

436
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:18,324
<i>At first, the news reverberates
around the world.</i>

437
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:22,865
<i>Then, just as quickly, the thrill-hungry
public becomes apathetic.</i>

438
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:26,293
<i>Fresh scandals appear and make headlines.</i>

439
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:30,666
<i>Events in the Jazz Age
move too rapidly, like Red Grange.</i>

440
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:35,169
<i>A population glutted with distractions
is quick to forget.</i>

441
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:41,966
<i>The '20s come to a crashing climax, and
still Leonard Zelig is nowhere to be found.</i>

442
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:51,146
<i>Dr. Eudora Fletcher
searches in vain to locate him.</i>

443
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:56,441
<i>When several leads prove disappointing,
she gives up, discouraged.</i>

444
00:28:57,361 --> 00:29:00,411
I felt it was a shame,
because here was this unique case

445
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,319
that I could make my reputation on.

446
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:05,163
Not that I knew how to cure him,

447
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:10,829
but if I could have him
alone and feel my way

448
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,090
and be innovative and creative,

449
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:18,800
I felt that I could change his life,
if I only had the chance.

450
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:31,517
MAN: (ON NEWSREEL) <i>300,000 of the

456

<i>This is the first time that this ritual

A commotion next to the Papal Father?</i>

460

chaos, as His Holiness Pope Pius XI</i>

<i>The faithful can't believe it.</i>

463

NARRATOR: <i>It is, of course, Zelig.</i>

464
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:13,903
<i>He is returned to the
United States by Italian authorities</i>

"no longer a curiosity

471
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:42,131
NARRATOR: <i>Dr. Fletcher has
no time now to think of marriage.</i>

<i>All her attention

00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:12,285
<i>For this, she contacts
her first cousin, Paul Deghuee,</i>

480
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:15,582
<i>an inventor and part-time photographer.</i>

481
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:21,416
And she said "I want to make a record
of this case for future generations

482
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:23,514
"and the world of science,

483
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:26,178
"and I want you
to keep the camera very quiet."

484
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:30,349
And I said, "Why don't you
just take notes and write it up?"

485
00:31:31,265 --> 00:31:35,765
She said, "Paul, when a man changes his
physical appearance, you want to see it.

486
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:40,898
"You can't read about it. Besides which,
I am planning to make history."

487
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:46,316
NARRATOR: <i>The "White Room"
is carefully arranged for maximum serenity.</i>

488
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:51,660
<i>It is a small study in Dr. Fletcher's
house, sparsely furnished.</i>

489
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:57,749
<i>Clumsy photographic lights are nailed to
the wall to provide sufficient illumination.</i>

490
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:03,172
<i>Microphones are hidden
in specially selected places.</i>

491
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:06,126
<i>The camera shoots through a pane of glass</i>

492
00:32:06,342 --> 00:32:08,682
<i>which renders it relatively unobtrusive.</i>

493
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:11,847
<i>Only the noise of the motor is a problem,</i>

494
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:14,851
<i>but this is muffled with a blanket
and anything else handy.</i>

495
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,860
<i>From this cramped vantage point,
photographer Paul Deghuee</i>

496
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:22,482
<i>will record
the famous "White Room Sessions, "</i>

497
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:26,360
<i>a remarkable document
in the history of psychotherapy.</i>

498
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:32,244
By today's standards, the White Room
Sessions would seem very primitive,

499
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,870
and yet they were really quite effective

500
00:32:35,955 --> 00:32:40,825
in developing a very strong personal
relation between doctor and patient.

501
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:45,129
The question whether Zelig was a psychotic

502
00:32:45,214 --> 00:32:48,474
or merely extremely neurotic

503
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:53,140
was a question that was endlessly
discussed among us doctors.

504
00:32:54,348 --> 00:32:56,428
Now, I myself felt that, uh...

505
00:32:57,226 --> 00:33:01,266
His feelings were really not
all that different from the normal,

506
00:33:01,522 --> 00:33:05,612
maybe what one would call
the well-adjusted, normal person,

507
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:09,861
only carried to an extreme degree,
to an extreme extent.

508
00:33:11,115 --> 00:33:16,325
I myself felt that one could really think
of him as the ultimate conformist.

509
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:23,671
Leonard, do you know why you're here?

510
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,668
To discuss psychiatry, right?

511
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:30,341
You're a doctor?

512
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:36,058
Yes, I am. I am. Perhaps you've read
my latest paper on delusional paranoia?

513
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:38,809
Turns out the entire thing is mental.

514
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,602
Now, suppose
I tell you you're not a doctor.

515
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,780
Well, uh...
I would say that you're making a joke.

516
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:53,207
Is it always so bright in here?

517
00:33:53,282 --> 00:33:56,792
Oh, I'm recording these sessions on film,
if you don't mind?

518
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:59,213
- No. Somebody's behind there, right?
- Mmm-hmm. That's right.

519
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:00,958
- That's a camera.
- Mmm-hmm.

520
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:05,915
Leonard... Leonard,
why don't we start with simple reality?

521
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:09,127
- Leonard, you're not a doctor.
- No?

522
00:34:09,465 --> 00:34:12,465
No. You're a patient. I'm the doctor.

523
00:34:13,594 --> 00:34:17,144
Well, I wouldn't tell that
to too many people if I were you.

524
00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:19,727
Leonard, you're not a doctor.

525
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:24,895
Is she gonna be all right? 'Cause...
Is this a...

526
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:28,732
I've gotta get back to town.
Really. I have an interesting case,

527
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:32,357
treating two sets of Siamese twins
with split personalities.

528
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:34,066
I'm getting paid by eight people.

529
00:34:36,492 --> 00:34:39,292
NARRATOR: <i>"The first week's sessions
did not go too well, "</i>

530
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,368
<i>writes Dr. Fletcher in her diary.</i>

531
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:45,962
<i>"Leonard identifies with me and
is convinced that he is a doctor.</i>

532
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:48,166
<i>"He is guarded and suspicious.</i>

533
00:34:48,504 --> 00:34:53,014
<i>"There is something appealing about him,
too. He's quick-witted and energetic.</i>

534
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:56,429
<i>"Perhaps it is
his very helplessness that moves me.</i>

535
00:34:57,179 --> 00:35:00,599
<i>"I must keep flexible
and play the situation by ear."</i>

536
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,192
How are you today, Leonard?

537
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:10,397
Fine. And I... Uh... (CLEARS THROAT)

538
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:12,526
I gotta get back to town soon. You know,

539
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:14,855
I teach a course
at the psychiatric institute

540
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:16,909
in masturbation and...

541
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:18,776
- I see.
- I'm a doctor, you know, and I...

542
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:22,504
"Guilt-related masturbation."

543
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:25,289
No, no, not guilt-related.
I... I teach advanced.

544
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:29,879
- I'm quite a respected doctor there.
- Leonard, I'd like you...

545
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:33,632
...eyes follow this pen
and just let yourself breathe deeply.

546
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:35,841
- Why? What...
- Relax.

547
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:38,637
No.
You're trying to hypnotize me, obviously.

548
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,350
- Do you mind?
- Of course I mind. I'm a doctor. I'm...

549
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:43,772
- Leonard, you're not a doctor.
- I am a doctor!

550
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:47,362
- Just relax.
- No, I can't. I'm... I'm due back in town.

551
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:50,567
I... I have this masturbation class.

552
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,729
If I'm not there, they start without me.

553
00:35:54,528 --> 00:35:56,038
NARRATOR: <i>As the weeks go by,</i>

554
00:35:56,113 --> 00:35:58,913
<i>Dr. Fletcher grows more
and more frustrated.</i>

555
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,036
<i>"Leonard continues to insist
he is a doctor,</i>

556
00:36:02,536 --> 00:36:05,286
<i>"and even refuses
to let me hypnotize him," she writes.</i>

557
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:08,509
<i>"I believe his experiences
of the past year</i>

558
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:12,504
<i>"have made him more defensive than ever.
It is discouraging."</i>

559
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,588
She was under great pressure,
you could tell.

560
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:19,298
She was moody and nervous. He was fine.

561
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:24,678
<i>Napping, sitting in his chair reading...
He used to refer to himself as Dr. Zelig.</i>

562
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:27,561
<i>He was reading books on psychiatry.</i>

563
00:36:28,312 --> 00:36:30,942
I told her "You'd better
get away for a day and relax.

564
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:33,612
"The strain is becoming too much for you."

565
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:38,276
NARRATOR: <i>Leaving Zelig alone,
Dr. Fletcher takes Paul Deghuee's advice</i>

566
00:36:38,614 --> 00:36:42,034
<i>and she and her fiancé
spend some hours off relaxing.</i>

567
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:46,164
<i>They go to Broadway,
then to a well-known nightclub,</i>

568
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:51,626
<i>where, despite a lively stage show,
Dr. Fletcher is distracted and uneasy.</i>

569
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:54,631
<i>She is unable to think
of anything but her patient.</i>

570
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:58,929
<i>The atmosphere with her fiancé, Koslow,
is awkward and strained.</i>

571
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:02,505
<i>He is put off
by her total obsession with Zelig.</i>

572
00:37:03,347 --> 00:37:07,677
<i>Ironically, it is in the noisy and
smoke-filled atmosphere of the nightclub</i>

573
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:11,808
<i>that Eudora Fletcher is struck
by a brilliant and innovative plan</i>

574
00:37:12,356 --> 00:37:14,776
<i>that will create
a major breakthrough in the case.</i>

575
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:25,744
- Dr. Zelig?
- Yes?

576
00:37:26,203 --> 00:37:29,253
I... I wonder if you could
help me with a problem.

577
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:32,666
Well, I'll certainly try.

578
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,880
Of course, we can't promise anything,
you know.

579
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:40,261
You see, last week I was with
a group of fairly erudite people

580
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:42,052
who were discussing the novel <i>Moby Dick,</i>

581
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:46,681
and I... I was afraid to admit
that I hadn't read it, so I lied.

582
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:51,061
Uh-huh.

583
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:57,902
You see, I want so badly to be liked, to be
like other people so that I don't stand out.

584
00:38:02,823 --> 00:38:06,873
- That's natural.
- I go to such extreme lengths to blend in.

585
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:10,122
Well...

586
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:13,967
You're a doctor, you know?

587
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,302
You... (CLEARS THROAT)
should know how to handle that.

588
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:19,378
No, but the truth of the matter is,

589
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,880
I... I'm not an actual doctor.

590
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:27,724
- You're not?
- No, Doctor.

591
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:34,899
No, I've... I've been pretending to be
a doctor to fit in with my friends.

592
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,900
You see, they're doctors.

593
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:40,859
That's...

594
00:38:42,321 --> 00:38:43,571
That's something.

595
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:49,236
But you're a doctor, and you can help me.
You have to help me.

596
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:53,828
Actually... I don't feel
that well, actually.

597
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:58,345
But my... My whole life's just been a lie.

598
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,420
I've been posing
as one thing after another.

599
00:39:01,882 --> 00:39:04,592
Well, you... You need help, lady. Um...

600
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:10,268
Last night... Last night,
I dreamt that I was falling into fire.

601
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:11,849
What does that mean?

602
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:14,236
That's terrible. I don't know.
You know, I...

603
00:39:14,311 --> 00:39:17,311
Please, Doctor. I know
I'm a very complicated patient.

604
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:20,817
- Jesus. I don't feel that well.
- What am I suffering from?

605
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:22,491
How should I know? I'm not a doctor.

606
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,650
- You're not?
- No. Am I?

607
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:27,735
- Who are you?
- What do you mean, who am I?

608
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:30,196
- I don't know. These are tough questions.
- Leonard Zelig.

609
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,709
- Yes, definitely. Who is he?
- You.

610
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:36,459
No. I'm nobody. I'm nothing.

611
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,588
Catch me, I'm falling.

612
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:43,049
NARRATOR:
<i>Playing on Zelig's identity disorder,</i>

613
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:46,931
<i>Dr. Fletcher has manipulated him
into momentary disorientation.</i>

614
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:50,432
<i>With his guard lowered,
she quickly puts him under hypnosis.</i>

615
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:55,732
<i>Using posthypnotic suggestion, she will
now be able to induce a trance at will.</i>

616
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,478
My brother beat me.

617
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,188
My sister beat my brother.

618
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:08,065
My father beat my sister
and my brother and me.

619
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:14,831
My mother beat my father
and my sister and me and my brother.

620
00:40:16,957 --> 00:40:19,247
The neighbors beat our family.

621
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:25,134
People down the block beat
the neighbors and our family.

622
00:40:26,842 --> 00:40:28,512
I'm 12 years old.

623
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:31,755
I run into a synagogue.

624
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:35,351
I ask the rabbi the meaning of life.

625
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:39,147
He tells me the meaning of life,

626
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:42,227
but he tells it to me in Hebrew.

627
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,572
I don't understand Hebrew.

628
00:40:47,696 --> 00:40:51,066
Then he wants to charge me $600
for Hebrew lessons.

629
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:56,406
NARRATOR: <i>Dr. Fletcher's therapy
consists of a two-pronged attack.</i>

630
00:40:57,289 --> 00:41:02,379
<i>In the trance state, the personality will
be deeply probed and then restructured.</i>

631
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:06,550
<i>In the conscious state,
she will provide love and affection,</i>

632
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:09,183
<i>unconditional positive regard.</i>

633
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:36,244
You will be completely honest.

634
00:41:36,745 --> 00:41:38,245
You're in a deep trance.

635
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:43,245
You will become, not who you think
I want you to be, but you'll be yourself.

636
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:46,551
Now, how do you feel about it here?

637
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:51,548
It's the worst.

638
00:41:52,594 --> 00:41:54,304
I hate the country.

639
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,970
I hate the grass and the mosquitoes.

640
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:02,983
And cooking... Your cooking is terrible.

641
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:05,685
Your pancakes...

642
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:08,989
They're... I dump them in the garbage
when you're not looking.

643
00:42:09,945 --> 00:42:13,155
- Uh-huh.
- And the jokes you try and tell when...

644
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,830
When you think you're amusing,

645
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:20,463
they're long and pointless,
there's no end to them.

646
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:23,956
I see. And what else?

647
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:28,708
I wanna go to bed with you.

648
00:42:32,551 --> 00:42:35,301
Oh... That surprises me.

649
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:38,137
I didn't think you liked me very much.

650
00:42:38,974 --> 00:42:40,314
I love you.

651
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:43,729
You do?

652
00:42:45,105 --> 00:42:48,015
You're very sweet, 'cause you're...

653
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,686
You're not as clever as you think you are.

654
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:53,109
You're all mixed up,

655
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:57,370
and nervous, and you're the worst cook.

656
00:42:57,993 --> 00:42:59,663
Those pancakes...

657
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,870
Oh, I love you.

658
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:04,498
I wanna take care of you.

659
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:08,340
No more pancakes.

660
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:22,271
FLETCHER: <i>I started out by trying
to use Leonard to make my reputation,</i>

661
00:43:22,976 --> 00:43:25,646
<i>and then I found that
I had very strong feelings for him.</i>

662
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:28,490
<i>I never thought I was attractive.</i>

663
00:43:28,565 --> 00:43:30,685
<i>I never had a real romance.</i>

664
00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:34,279
<i>Charles Koslow was the type of man
my mother felt I should marry.</i>

665
00:43:41,036 --> 00:43:43,456
NARRATOR: <i>Feeling more confident
every day with her patient,</i>

666
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:45,788
<i>Dr. Fletcher takes him
for a cautious outing,</i>

667
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:49,461
<i>an afternoon at
her sister's house in nearby Teaneck.</i>

668
00:43:50,462 --> 00:43:54,552
<i>Meryl Fletcher is an aviatrix,
a fine professional pilot.</i>

669
00:43:55,342 --> 00:43:57,892
<i>Eudora Fletcher is an amateur pilot,</i>

670
00:43:58,053 --> 00:44:02,893
<i>and the afternoon is spent relaxing
and retelling old flying experiences.</i>

671
00:44:05,435 --> 00:44:07,988
<i>As the weeks pass, Zelig is encouraged</i>

672
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:11,113
<i>to open up more and more,
to give his own opinions.</i>

673
00:44:11,733 --> 00:44:15,243
<i>What was guarded at first
soon becomes expansive.</i>

674
00:44:16,029 --> 00:44:19,569
ZELIG: <i>I hated my stepmother,
and I don't care who knows it.</i>

675
00:44:22,494 --> 00:44:24,084
<i>I love baseball.</i>

676
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:28,287
<i>You know, it doesn't have to mean
anything, it's just very beautiful to watch.</i>

677
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:34,803
<i>I'm a Democrat. I always was a Democrat.</i>

678
00:44:37,092 --> 00:44:39,552
<i>Is it okay if I don't agree with you
about that recording?</i>

679
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:43,721
- FLETCHER: <i>Of course.</i>
- ZELIG: <i>I mean, Brahms is just always</i>

680
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:46,387
<i>too melodramatic for me.</i>

681
00:44:49,479 --> 00:44:52,907
<i>You have to be your own person
and make your own moral choices,</i>

682
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:58,572
<i>even when they do require real courage,
otherwise you're like a robot, or a lizard.</i>

683
00:45:01,241 --> 00:45:02,991
<i>Are you really gonna
get married to that lawyer?</i>

684
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:05,746
<i>I... I would much rather you didn't.</i>

685
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:11,037
<i>No, I don't agree.
I think this guy Mussolini is a loser.</i>

686
00:45:13,837 --> 00:45:16,297
<i>Uh... Are we ever gonna make love?</i>

687
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:21,092
NARRATOR: <i>It has been three months, and
the board wishes to examine the patient.</i>

688
00:45:21,803 --> 00:45:24,603
<i>Dr. Fletcher says
Zelig is not ready to leave the premises.</i>

689
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:27,024
<i>The doctors agree to visit him there.</i>

690
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:29,885
<i>The date is set, four days hence.</i>

691
00:45:30,812 --> 00:45:34,942
<i>If progress is insufficient,
she will be removed from the case.</i>

692
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:40,662
I was very nervous,
because in his waking state

693
00:45:40,989 --> 00:45:43,369
he never remembered
anything from his trance state,

694
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:48,410
and I wondered if there could be some
way of locking these two things together.

695
00:45:49,122 --> 00:45:54,502
And then I also was worried
that if he was with strong personalities,

696
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:56,379
he might lose his personality.

697
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:00,130
NARRATOR:
<i>Sunday at noon. The doctors arrive.</i>

698
00:46:00,842 --> 00:46:04,012
<i>They are greeted
by Eudora Fletcher and Leonard Zelig</i>

699
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:05,847
<i>and are shown around the grounds.</i>

700
00:46:06,598 --> 00:46:08,942
<i>Though Dr. Fletcher is tense and alert,</i>

701
00:46:09,017 --> 00:46:11,637
<i>Leonard Zelig seems calm and at ease.</i>

702
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:16,645
<i>Despite the fact that he is surrounded
by physicians, he does not turn into one.</i>

703
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:21,111
<i>The encounter appears
to be a resounding success,</i>

704
00:46:21,404 --> 00:46:25,034
<i>when Dr. Henry Mayerson comments
innocently about the weather,</i>

705
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:27,196
<i>saying that it is a nice day.</i>

706
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:32,617
<i>Zelig tells Dr. Mayerson that
he does not agree that it is a nice day.</i>

707
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:37,705
<i>Dr. Mayerson is taken aback
at the firmness of Zelig's conviction.</i>

708
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:42,220
<i>He points out that
the sun is shining and that it is mild.</i>

709
00:46:43,593 --> 00:46:48,563
<i>Zelig, trained to voice his own personal
opinions fearlessly, is too aggressive.</i>

710
00:46:49,057 --> 00:46:51,677
<i>He has been molded
too far in the other direction.</i>

711
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:53,862
<i>He has become over-opinionated,</i>

712
00:46:53,937 --> 00:46:56,607
<i>and cannot brook
any disagreement with his own views.</i>

713
00:46:58,358 --> 00:47:00,398
I had taken him
too far in the other direction.

714
00:47:01,277 --> 00:47:04,907
He had struck Dr. Mayerson and
several board members with a rake.

715
00:47:05,615 --> 00:47:10,115
This was not what we wanted, and yet
I felt that I had accomplished something.

716
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:15,290
<i>I felt if I could have him for two more
weeks, I could do some fine-tuning</i>

717
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:18,838
<i>and turn Leonard Zelig
back into his own man.</i>

718
00:47:30,807 --> 00:47:32,427
MAN: (ON NEWSREEL)
<i>Dr. Eudora Nesbit Fletcher,</i>

719
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:35,097
<i>the hero, or should we say heroine,
of the hour.</i>

720
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:39,824
<i>The beautiful and brilliant psychiatrist
never lost faith in her conviction</i>

721
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:43,489
<i>that Leonard Zelig, the human chameleon,
was suffering from a mental disorder.</i>

722
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:46,905
<i>Working with her cousin,
cameraman Paul Deghuee,</i>

723
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:49,530
<i>the doctor managed to keep
a vital record of the proceedings</i>

724
00:47:49,951 --> 00:47:52,791
<i>including rare footage
of Zelig hypnotized.</i>

725
00:47:53,872 --> 00:47:56,962
<i>The patient and his healer have become
fast friends in the process,</i>

726
00:47:57,292 --> 00:48:00,462
<i>and enjoy one another's company
even when she's not working on him.</i>

727
00:48:01,129 --> 00:48:03,969
<i>The result of maintaining
a courageous minority opinion</i>

728
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:06,842
<i>is a resounding success for psychiatry.</i>

729
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:09,763
<i>Who says women are just good for sewing?</i>

730
00:48:10,972 --> 00:48:12,392
<i>Now it's on to City Hall,</i>

731
00:48:12,473 --> 00:48:15,063
<i>where the town's newest celebrities are
given the key to the city.</i>

732
00:48:16,311 --> 00:48:18,561
CITY HALL SPEAKER: We're honored
to present this key to New York City

733
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:19,686
to the two of you.

734
00:48:22,984 --> 00:48:26,534
And, uh... Jimmy Walker
did wanna be here this afternoon

735
00:48:26,696 --> 00:48:29,446
and sing <i>Leonard the Lizard,</i>
but he was just too busy.

736
00:48:33,286 --> 00:48:35,996
MAN: (ON NEWSREEL) <i>After City Hall,
Eudora Fletcher, the beautiful genius</i>

737
00:48:36,331 --> 00:48:38,831
<i>who cured Zelig
of his science-defying condition,</i>

738
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:42,837
<i>is honored by fellow scientists
at New York's Waldorf-Astoria.</i>

739
00:48:43,046 --> 00:48:45,506
<i>Present are luminaries from
all over the world,</i>

740
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:47,340
<i>not just in the field of psychiatry,</i>

741
00:48:47,634 --> 00:48:50,854
<i>but physics, biology,
mathematics, and you name it.</i>

742
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:53,719
<i>Here she is exchanging theories
with Nils Andersen,</i>

743
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:55,850
<i>the father of modern blood disease.</i>

744
00:48:58,102 --> 00:49:01,652
<i>Later in the week, Dr. Fletcher is again
honored by the greatest city in the world,</i>

745
00:49:01,814 --> 00:49:04,194
<i>as she gets to christen her first ship.</i>

746
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:07,315
<i>Quite a success story
for a little girl from the backwoods.</i>

747
00:49:08,029 --> 00:49:11,699
MALE NEWSCASTER: <i>Dr. Fletcher has
smashed the bottle, not champagne...</i>

748
00:49:12,367 --> 00:49:15,407
I'm speaking to you from
the home of Mrs. Catherine Fletcher.

749
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:18,870
She's the mother of Dr. Eudora Fletcher,

750
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:21,668
the famous psychiatrist
so much in the news these days.

751
00:49:22,043 --> 00:49:24,883
And I'm going to be
asking Mrs. Fletcher to...

752
00:49:25,755 --> 00:49:31,505
To begin with, to tell us something about
what it's like to raise a medical genius.

753
00:49:31,803 --> 00:49:35,723
And I might ask you
about the many sacrifices

754
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:38,558
that you've made to put your daughter
through medical school.

755
00:49:38,685 --> 00:49:41,029
And could you speak
right into the microphones, please?

756
00:49:41,104 --> 00:49:44,654
Sacrifices, we had none.
John was a stockbroker,

757
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:48,896
he had plenty of money, and I came
from a wealthy Philadelphia family, so...

758
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:52,450
Well, I'm sure that your daughter
always wanted to be a doctor,

759
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:54,027
ever since she could remember.

760
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:58,084
I don't think so.

761
00:49:58,705 --> 00:50:02,915
I always thought she'd want to be a flier
like her sister Meryl and raise a family.

762
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:07,921
- But she was a very moody...
- But still, a mother always dreams

763
00:50:08,006 --> 00:50:10,796
for her child to have the kind of success
that your daughter has.

764
00:50:11,259 --> 00:50:14,219
- She was a very difficult girl.
- Well, tell me about your husband.

765
00:50:14,804 --> 00:50:17,104
I understand that
he is a simple businessman.

766
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:19,181
He must be so thrilled and pleased

767
00:50:19,267 --> 00:50:21,517
to have his daughter
achieve such recognition.

768
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:26,607
John had problems, depression. He drank.

769
00:50:27,567 --> 00:50:31,737
Well, Mrs. Fletcher, thank you
so much for speaking with us today.

770
00:50:40,872 --> 00:50:42,122
MAN: (ON NEWSREEL) <i>Here at San Simeon,</i>

<i>But who cares, if they're having fun?</i>

798
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:31,569
Leonard Zelig, do you want to give
the kids of this country some advice?

799
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:34,744
I sure do. Kids, you gotta be yourself.

800
00:52:35,528 --> 00:52:37,038
You know, you can't act like anybody else

801
00:52:37,113 --> 00:52:40,073
just because you think that they have
all the answers and you don't.

802
00:52:40,783 --> 00:52:44,163
You have to be your own man and learn
to speak up and say what's on your mind.

803
00:52:44,871 --> 00:52:47,121
Now, maybe they're not free
to do that in foreign countries,

804
00:52:47,206 --> 00:52:48,876
but that's the American way.

805
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,960
And you can take it from me, because I
used to be a member of the reptile family,

806
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:54,835
but I'm not anymore.

807
00:53:00,261 --> 00:53:04,221
MAN: (SINGING)
<i>I'm sittin' on top of the world</i>

808
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:06,349
<i>I'm rollin' along</i>

809
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:09,229
<i>Just rollin' along</i>

810
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:14,033
<i>Oh boy, I'm quittin'
the blues of the world</i>

811
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:15,898
<i>I'm singin' a song</i>

812
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:18,361
<i>Just singin' a song</i>

813
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:21,993
<i>Glory, hallelujah, I told Leonard Zelig</i>

814
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,490
<i>Hey, Len, get ready to call</i>

815
00:53:25,244 --> 00:53:29,424
<i>Just like Humpty Dumpty, I'm ready to fall</i>

816
00:53:29,582 --> 00:53:32,792
<i>I'm sittin' on top of the world</i>

817
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,630
<i>My, my, my, rollin' along</i>

818
00:53:36,923 --> 00:53:39,933
<i>Rollin' along</i>

819
00:53:40,468 --> 00:53:44,558
NARRATOR: <i>Zelig, no longer a chameleon,
is at last his own man.</i>

820
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:50,651
<i>His point of view on politics, art,
life and love is honest and direct.</i>

821
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:56,072
<i>Though his taste is described
by many as lowbrow, it is his own.</i>

822
00:53:56,984 --> 00:54:00,074
<i>He is finally an individual,
a human being.</i>

823
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:02,414
<i>He no longer gives up his own identity</i>

824
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:05,240
<i>to be a safe and invisible
part of his surroundings.</i>

825
00:54:05,952 --> 00:54:07,372
Oh, his taste wasn't terrible.

826
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:12,670
He was the kind of man who preferred
watching baseball to reading <i>Moby Dick.</i>

827
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,500
And that got him off on the wrong foot,
or so the legend goes.

828
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:22,090
It was much more a matter of symbolism.
To the Marxists, he was one thing.

829
00:54:23,803 --> 00:54:27,353
The Catholic Church never
forgave him for the Vatican incident.

830
00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:32,728
The American people, in the throes
of the Depression as they were,

831
00:54:33,688 --> 00:54:38,188
found in him a symbol of possibility,
of self-improvement and self-fulfillment.

832
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:40,531
And of course, the Freudians had a ball.

833
00:54:40,653 --> 00:54:44,073
They could interpret him
in any way they pleased.

834
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:47,833
It was all symbolism,
but there were no two intellectuals

835
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:49,952
who agreed about what it meant.

836
00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:53,538
I don't know if you could call it
a triumph of psychotherapy.

837
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:56,294
It seems more like
a triumph of aesthetic instincts,

838
00:54:56,377 --> 00:54:59,457
because Dr. Fletcher's
techniques didn't owe anything to

839
00:54:59,755 --> 00:55:01,795
then-current schools of therapy.

840
00:55:02,133 --> 00:55:04,393
But she sensed what was needed
and she provided it,

841
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:08,140
and that was, in its way,
a remarkable creative accomplishment.

842
00:55:09,098 --> 00:55:11,728
When I think about it,
it seems to me that his story

843
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:15,149
reflected a lot of
the Jewish experience in America,

844
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:18,866
the great urge to push in
and to find one's place

845
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:21,651
and then to assimilate into the culture.

846
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:24,359
I mean, he wanted
to assimilate like crazy.

847
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:26,739
<i>(SUNNY SIDE UP</i> PLAYING)

848
00:55:33,414 --> 00:55:37,594
NARRATOR: <i>Eudora Fletcher's life
has also changed from this experience.</i>

849
00:55:38,336 --> 00:55:41,416
<i>For her, fame and recognition
are empty rewards</i>

850
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:45,432
<i>and do not live up to the adolescent
fantasies that prompted her ambition.</i>

851
00:55:46,594 --> 00:55:49,354
<i>She and her patient have fallen in love,</i>

852
00:55:49,597 --> 00:55:53,847
<i>and it is no surprise when she forsakes
the upwardly mobile attorney Koslow</i>

853
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:56,936
<i>and announces wedding plans with Zelig.</i>

854
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:01,821
WOMAN: (SINGING) <i>Now there's one thing
to think of when you're blue</i>

855
00:56:03,319 --> 00:56:06,029
<i>There are others much worse off than you</i>

856
00:56:07,365 --> 00:56:10,525
<i>If a load of trouble should arrive</i>

857
00:56:11,327 --> 00:56:14,787
<i>Laugh and say it's great to be alive</i>

858
00:56:15,456 --> 00:56:18,916
<i>Keep your sunny side up, up</i>

859
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:22,423
<i>Hide the side that gets blue</i>

860
00:56:23,547 --> 00:56:26,927
<i>If you have nine sons in a row</i>

861
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:31,060
<i>Baseball teams make money, you know</i>

862
00:56:31,597 --> 00:56:34,977
<i>Keep your funny side up, up</i>

863
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:38,849
<i>Let your laughter come through, do</i>

864
00:56:39,647 --> 00:56:43,567
<i>Stand up on your legs,

865
00:56:43,651 --> 00:56:47,151
<i>Keep your sunny side up, up</i>

866
00:56:48,072 --> 00:56:51,082
<i>Keep your sunny side up</i>

867
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:55,499
It was wonderful to see
my sister and Leonard together.

868
00:56:56,414 --> 00:56:58,174
She drew strength from him,

869
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:03,343
and they were so much
in love with each other.

870
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:08,010
She looked happier than she had in years.

871
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:13,807
I remember they decided
to get married in the spring,

872
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:17,596
and then, of course, the roof fell in.

873
00:57:19,728 --> 00:57:21,438
NARRATOR: <i>Two weeks before the wedding,</i>

874
00:57:21,522 --> 00:57:25,032
<i>an ex-showgirl named Lita Fox comes forth</i>

875
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:28,069
<i>and claims that she is married to Zelig.</i>

876
00:57:29,238 --> 00:57:31,488
<i>She also claims to have had his child.</i>

877
00:57:32,116 --> 00:57:34,196
<i>It is an immediate scandal.</i>

878
00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:41,462
We were married a year ago.
He said he was an actor.

879
00:57:41,876 --> 00:57:45,586
He sounded just like one,
and I'm in show business, too.

880
00:57:47,173 --> 00:57:49,593
So we drove to Baltimore
and we were married,

881
00:57:50,134 --> 00:57:51,684
and I have a license to prove it.

882
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,640
NARRATOR: <i>He had married her while
under a different personality.</i>

883
00:57:56,515 --> 00:58:00,095
<i>When she read of the plans for his
forthcoming wedding to Eudora Fletcher,</i>

884
00:58:00,478 --> 00:58:03,478
<i>she was mortified
and decided to take legal action.</i>

885
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:06,438
<i>Zelig says he will fight it in court,</i>

886
00:58:06,901 --> 00:58:09,951
<i>but public opinion begins
subtly to shift away from him.</i>

887
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:15,703
<i>Clever attorneys portray Lita Fox
as an abandoned woman.</i>

888
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:19,038
<i>The child is neglected,
poor and fatherless.</i>

889
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:23,712
<i>Zelig has sold his life story to Hollywood
for a large sum of money.</i>

890
00:58:24,752 --> 00:58:27,842
<i>When the scandal breaks,
the studio demands its money back.</i>

891
00:58:28,756 --> 00:58:32,636
<i>Zelig can only return half
as the rest has already been spent.</i>

892
00:58:33,594 --> 00:58:38,604
<i>Outraged, the studio gives him half his
life back. They keep the best moments,</i>

893
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:42,439
<i>and he is left with only
his sleeping hours and mealtimes.</i>

894
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:47,105
<i>Zelig is shaken by the scandal,
but it is only the beginning.</i>

895
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:50,369
<i>Now another woman steps forward.</i>

896
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:53,614
<i>Helen Gray, a salesgirl
from a Wisconsin gift shop</i>

897
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:56,911
<i>claims that Zelig
is the father of her twins.</i>

898
00:58:57,451 --> 00:59:00,791
<i>She tells her lawyers that he passed
himself off as a fur trapper.</i>

899
00:59:01,956 --> 00:59:03,746
<i>Zelig has no recollection,</i>

900
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:07,420
<i>but admits it could have happened
when he was under one of his spells.</i>

901
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:10,505
<i>It is the signal
for the floodgates to open.</i>

902
00:59:11,423 --> 00:59:14,013
He married me up
at the First Church of Harlem.

903
00:59:14,635 --> 00:59:16,795
He told me he was
the brother of Duke Ellington.

904
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:21,980
He was the guy who smashed my car up.
It was brand-new.

905
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:25,900
Then he backed up over my mother's wrist.

906
00:59:26,647 --> 00:59:30,187
She's elderly, and uses her wrist a lot.

907
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:34,235
He painted my house a disgusting color.

908
00:59:35,364 --> 00:59:36,824
He said he was a painter.

909
00:59:37,408 --> 00:59:41,158
I couldn't believe the results.
Then he disappeared.

910
00:59:42,246 --> 00:59:44,536
NARRATOR: <i>That Zelig could be
responsible for the behavior</i>

911
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:46,833
<i>of each of the personalities he assumed</i>

912
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:49,207
<i>means dozens of lawsuits.</i>

913
00:59:49,587 --> 00:59:53,507
<i>He is sued for bigamy,
adultery, automobile accidents,</i>

914
00:59:53,591 --> 00:59:56,602
<i>plagiarism, household damages, negligence,</i>

915
00:59:56,677 --> 01:00:00,427
<i>property damages, and performing
unnecessary dental extractions.</i>

916
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:04,227
I would like to apologize to everyone.

917
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:07,350
I'm awfully sorry
for marrying all those women.

918
01:00:07,438 --> 01:00:10,518
It just... I don't know,
it just seemed like the thing to do.

919
01:00:11,317 --> 01:00:14,947
And to the gentleman
whose appendix I took out,

920
01:00:15,279 --> 01:00:16,949
I'm... I don't know what to say.

921
01:00:17,031 --> 01:00:20,991
If it's any consolation, I may still
have it somewhere around the house.

922
01:00:23,037 --> 01:00:26,247
My deepest apology goes
to the Trokman family in Detroit.

923
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:30,541
I... I never delivered a baby before
in my life,

924
01:00:30,628 --> 01:00:35,088
and I, I just thought
that ice tongs was the way to do it.

925
01:00:36,592 --> 01:00:39,972
NARRATOR: <i>Thriving mercilessly
on loopholes and technicalities,</i>

926
01:00:40,054 --> 01:00:42,894
<i>the American legal profession
has a field day.</i>

927
01:00:43,432 --> 01:00:47,732
<i>Zelig is branded a criminal.
Despite Dr. Fletcher's insistence</i>

<i>that he cannot be held
responsible for his actions</i>

929
01:00:50,272 --> 01:00:53,282
<i>while in his chameleon state,
it is no use.</i>

930
01:00:53,901 --> 01:00:57,491
WOMAN:
<i>Leonard Zelig sets a bad moral influence.</i>

931
01:00:58,405 --> 01:01:03,485
<i>America is a moral country.
It's a God-fearing country.</i>

932
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,910
We don't condone scandals,

933
01:01:07,748 --> 01:01:10,418
scandals of fraud and polygamy.

934
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,250
In keeping with a pure society,

935
01:01:15,089 --> 01:01:18,049
I say lynch the little Hebe!

936
01:01:19,677 --> 01:01:21,847
NARRATOR:
<i>Throughout the humiliating ordeal,</i>

937
01:01:21,929 --> 01:01:25,429
<i>Eudora Fletcher stands by
the man she loves, valiantly.</i>

938
01:01:26,809 --> 01:01:31,269
<i>Privately, she tells friends that she is
worried about Zelig's emotional condition,</i>

939
01:01:31,563 --> 01:01:33,741
<i>which seems to her to be deteriorating</i>

940
01:01:33,816 --> 01:01:36,106
<i>under the weight of
conservative moral opinion.</i>

941
01:01:37,486 --> 01:01:40,776
<i>In public, he tries to keep up
an appearance of composure,</i>

942
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:42,659
<i>but it is increasingly difficult.</i>

943
01:01:43,534 --> 01:01:48,294
<i>It is clear he is coming apart when he and
Eudora Fletcher dine at a Greek restaurant,</i>

944
01:01:48,789 --> 01:01:52,459
<i>and in the midst of the meal,
Zelig begins to turn Greek.</i>

945
01:01:59,508 --> 01:02:04,098
<i>He longs desperately to be liked
once again, to be accepted, to fit in.</i>

946
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:08,640
<i>Public clamor over his morality
reaches a fever pitch,</i>

947
01:02:08,726 --> 01:02:13,306
<i>and on the eve of his sentencing,
Leonard Zelig vanishes.</i>

948
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:24,073
<i>This is Chief Inspector
of Police Thomas Dowd</i>

<i>We are searching for clues and

<i>who might have any information

MERYL: <i>My sister was just shattered.</i>

957
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:54,690
<i>She tried, you know, she tried to keep up
a calm front but she was just too upset.</i>

<i>And she wasn't a person

"Come on, let's go out for dinner.

991
01:05:06,653 --> 01:05:09,533
Yes, but then it really made sense,
it made all the sense in the world,

992
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:14,536
because although he wanted to be loved,
craved to be loved,

993
01:05:14,703 --> 01:05:17,003
there was also something in him

994
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:21,500

in the mass and anonymity,

995

that kind of opportunity.</i>

1031

and Hitler was extremely upset.

1032

The SS wanted to grab Zelig,

they probably would have tortured him,

In the confusion, Fletcher and Zelig got
out of the building through a side door.

1072

01:16:20,201 --> 01:16:22,629
<i>Crawling in your hair, chameleon</i>

1121
01:16:22,704 --> 01:16:28,004
<i>Take away all your care,
chameleon, chameleon, chameleon days</i>

1122
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:30,504
<i>(DOIN' THE CHAMELEON</i> PLAYING)

1123
01:16:30,587 --> 01:16:32,764
MAN: (SINGING)
<i>There's a brand-new dance come up the river</i>

1124
01:16:32,839 --> 01:16:34,974
<i>Just jerk your head and shake your liver</i>

1125
01:16:35,049 --> 01:16:37,929
<i>You're doin' the Chameleon</i>

1126
01:16:38,845 --> 01:16:41,773
<i>Fo-do-do-de-oh,
make a face that's like a lizard</i>

1127
01:16:41,848 --> 01:16:44,018
<i>And feel that beat down in your gizzard</i>

1128
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:47,278
<i>You're doin' the Chameleon</i>

1129
01:16:47,353 --> 01:16:48,483
<i>Ah!</i>

1130
01:16:49,105 --> 01:16:51,225
<i>Stick out your tongue
the way the reptiles do</i>

1131
01:16:51,316 --> 01:16:53,186
<i>Tryin' to catch a fly</i>

1132
01:16:53,526 --> 01:16:55,696
<i>Inflate your lungs like big crocodiles do</i>

1133
01:16:55,778 --> 01:16:57,698
<i>Hey, hey, my oh my</i>

1134
01:16:58,031 --> 01:17:00,166
<i>Throw your best gal down
right on the floor</i>

1135
01:17:00,241 --> 01:17:02,126
<i>She'll be beggin' you for more</i>

1136
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:05,001
<i>And you're doin' the Chameleon</i>

1137
01:17:06,706 --> 01:17:08,876
<i>If you hold your breath till you turn blue</i>

1138
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:11,088
<i>You'll be changing colors like they do</i>

1139
01:17:11,169 --> 01:17:14,089
<i>When you're doin' the Chameleon</i>

1140
01:17:15,048 --> 01:17:17,968
<i>Fo-do-do-de-oh, wiggle like a salamander</i>

1141
01:17:18,051 --> 01:17:20,186
<i>Go this way, that way, all meander</i>

1142
01:17:20,261 --> 01:17:23,221
<i>You're doin' the Chameleon</i>

1143
01:17:23,556 --> 01:17:24,676
<i>Ah!</i>

1144
01:17:25,308 --> 01:17:27,388
<i>Stick out your tongue
the way the reptiles do</i>

1145
01:17:27,477 --> 01:17:29,437
<i>Tryin' to catch a fly</i>

1146
01:17:29,729 --> 01:17:31,939
<i>Inflate your lungs like big crocodiles do</i>

1147
01:17:32,023 --> 01:17:33,903
<i>Hey, hey, my oh my</i>

1148
01:17:34,233 --> 01:17:36,536
<i>Shake your shoulders,
move your seat around</i>

1149
01:17:36,611 --> 01:17:38,781
<i>Get right down and kick your feet around</i>

1150
01:17:38,863 --> 01:17:43,123
<i>Doin' the Chameleon, fo-de-oh-do</i>
