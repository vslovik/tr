ï»¿He was the phenomenon of the '20s.
2
When you think, at the time, he was as well-known as Lindbergh, it's really quite astonishing.
3
His story reflected the nature of our civilization, the character of our times, yet it was also one man's story. And all the themes of our culture were there. Heroism, will, things like that.
4
But when you look back on it, it was very strange.
5
Well, it is ironic to see how quickly he has faded from memory, considering what an astounding record he made.
6
He was, of course, very amusing, but at the same time touched a nerve in people, perhaps in a way in which they would prefer not to be touched.
7
It certainly is a very bizarre story.
8
The year is 1928.
9
America, enjoying a decade of unequalled prosperity, has gone wild.
10
The Jazz Age, it is called. The rhythms are syncopated, the morals are looser, the liquor is cheaper, when you can get it.
11
It is a time of diverse heroes and madcap stunts, of speakeasies and flamboyant parties.
12
One typical party occurs at the Long Island estate
13
of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Porter Sutton, socialites, patrons of the arts.
14
Politicians and poets rub elbows with the cream of high society.
15
Present at the party is Scott Fitzgerald, who is to cast perspective on the '20s for all future generations.
16
He writes in his notebook about a curious little man named Leon Selwyn or Zelman, who seemed clearly to be an aristocrat, and extolled the very rich as he chatted with socialites.
17
He spoke adoringly of Coolidge and the Republican party, all in an upper-class Boston accent.
18
"An hour later," writes Fitzgerald, "I was stunned to see the same man speaking with the kitchen help."
19
"Now, he claimed to be a Democrat and his accent seemed to be coarse, "as if he were one of the crowd." It is the first small notice taken of Leonard Zelig.
20
Florida, one year later.
21
An odd incident occurs at the New York Yankees' training camp.
22
Journalists, anxious as always to immortalize the exploits of the great home-run hitters, notice a strange new player waiting his turn at bat after Babe Ruth.
23
He is listed on the roster as Lou Zelig, but no one on the team has heard of him.
24
Security guards are called, and he is escorted from the premises.
25
It appears as a small item in the next day's newspaper.
26
Chicago, Illinois, that same year.
27
There is a private party at a speakeasy on the South Side.
28
People from the most respectable walks of life dance and drink bathtub gin.
29
Present that evening was Calvin Turner, a waiter.
30
A lotta customers, a lotta gangsters came in the place.
31
'Cause they always good tippers and take good care of us, and of course we try to take care of our customers.
32
But on this particular night, I looked over and here's a strange guy comin' in. I'd never seen him before, so I asked one of the others, I say,
33
"John, you know this guy? You ever seen him?" So he looks. "No, I ain't never seen him before."
34
"I don't know who he is, but I know he's a tough-looking hombre."
35
So I looked over, and next thing, the guy had disappeared.
36
I don't know where he went to, but about this time, the music usually gets started. and I looked, and here's a colored guy, a colored boy playin' trumpet.
37
Man, he was playin' back. I looked at the guy and said "Well, my goodness. "He looks just like that gangster, but the gangster was white "and this guy is black." So I don't know what's... What's happening.
38
New York City. It is several months later.
39
Police are investigating the disappearance of a clerk named Leonard Zelig.
40
Both his landlady and his employer have reported him missing.
41
They tell police he was an odd little man who kept to himself.
42
Only two clues are found in Zelig's Greenwich Village flat.
43
One, a photograph of Zelig with Eugene O'Neill, and one of him as Pagliacci.
44
Acting on a tip, they trace his whereabouts to Chinatown, where, in the rear of a Chinese establishment, a strange-looking Oriental who fits the description of Leonard Zelig is discovered.
45
Suspicious, the detectives try to pull off his disguise, but it is not a disguise, and a fight breaks out.
46
He is removed by force, and taken to Manhattan Hospital.
47
In the ambulance, he rants and curses in what sounds like authentic Chinese.
48
He is restrained with a straitjacket.
49
When he emerges from the car incredibly, he is no longer Chinese, but Caucasian.
50
Bewildered interns place him in the emergency room for observation.
51
At 7:00 a.m., Dr. Eudora Fletcher, a psychiatrist, makes her usual rounds.
52
When I first heard about this emergency case that had been brought in, I didn't think anything peculiar. And when I first laid eyes on him, it was a bit strange, because I mistook him for a doctor.
53
He had a very professional demeanor about him.
54
As a young psychiatrist, Eudora Fletcher is fascinated by Leonard Zelig.
55
She convinces the conservative staff at the hospital to allow her to pursue a study of the new admission.
56
- What do you do? - Oh, me? I'm a psychiatrist.
57
- Oh, yes? - Yes, yes, I work mostly with delusional paranoids.
58
- Tell me about it. - Oh, there's not much to tell. I...
59
I work mostly on the Continent, and I've written quite a few psychoanalytic papers.
60
I've studied a great deal. I worked with Freud in Vienna.
61
Yes, we broke over the concept of penis envy.
62
Freud felt that it should be limited to women.
63
FLETCHER: It's not that he was making any sense at all.
64
It was just a conglomeration of psychological double-talk
65
that he had apparently heard, or perhaps was familiar with through reading.
66
The funny thing was that his delivery was quite fluid, and might have been really quite convincing to someone who did not know any better.
67
Who was this Leonard Zelig that seemed to create such diverse impressions everywhere?
68
All that was known of him was that he was the son of a Yiddish actor named Morris Zelig, whose performance as Puck in the Orthodox version of A Midsummer Night's Dream, was coolly received.
69
The elder Zelig's second marriage is marked by constant violent quarrelling, so much so, that although the family lives over a bowling alley, it is the bowling alley that complains of noise.
70
As a boy, Leonard is frequently bullied by anti-Semites.
71
His parents, who never take his part and blame him for everything, side with the anti-Semites.
72
They punish him often by locking him in a dark closet.
73
When they are really angry, they get into the closet with him.
74
On his deathbed, Morris Zelig tells his son that life is a meaningless nightmare of suffering, and the only advice he gives him is to save string.
75
Though brother Jack has a nervous breakdown, and sister Ruth becomes a shoplifter and alcoholic, Leonard Zelig appears to have adjusted to life.
76
Somehow, he seems to have coped.
77
And then, suddenly, increasingly strange behavior.
78
Fascinated by the Zelig phenomenon, Dr. Fletcher arranges a series of experiments and invites the skeptical staff to observe.
79
With the doctors watching, Zelig becomes a perfect psychiatrist.
80
When two Frenchmen are brought in, Zelig assumes their characters and speaks reasonable French.
81
In the company of a Chinese person, he begins to develop oriental features.
82
By now, word has gotten out to the press, and a public thirsting for thrills and novelty is immediately captivated.
83
The clamor is so great that Dr. Allan Sindell is forced to issue a statement.
84
We're just beginning to realize the dimensions of what could be the scientific medical phenomenon of the age, and possibly of all time.
85
Fresh stories roll off the press every day about Zelig and his puzzling condition.
86
Although the doctors claim to have the situation in hand, no two can agree on a diagnosis.
87
I'm convinced that it's glandular in nature and although there's no evidence now of any misfunction, I'm sure that further tests will show a problem in the secretions.
88
I'm certain it's something he picked up from eating Mexican food.
89
This manifestation is neurological in origin.
90
Now, this patient is suffering from a brain tumor, and I should not be surprised if, within several weeks, he died.
91
Now, we have not as yet been able to locate the tumor, but we're still looking.
92
Ironically, within two weeks' time, it is Dr. Birsky himself who dies of a brain tumor.
93
Leonard Zelig is fine.
94
Throughout the weeks of testing and speculation, Eudora Fletcher begins to feel that the patient might be suffering not from a physiological disorder, but from a psychological one.
95
It is Zelig's unstable make-up, she suggests, that accounts for his metamorphoses.
96
The governing board of doctors is hostile to her notion.
97
They conclude that Zelig's malady can be traced to poor alignment of the vertebrae.
98
Tests prove them wrong, and cause a temporary problem for the patient.
99
Now, the press and public hang on every bit of news, thoroughly absorbed in the real-life drama.
100
The continuing saga of the strange creature at Manhattan Hospital goes on.
101
This morning, doctors report, experiments were conducted and several women of varying types were placed in close proximity to the subject, but no change occurred, leading authorities to conclude that the phenomenon does not occur with women.
102
Later today, doctors will be experimenting with a midget and a chicken.
103
Leonard Zelig continues to astound scientists at New York's Manhattan Hospital, where numerous tests have led nowhere in determining the nature of this astonishing manifestation.
104
He is confronted by two overweight men at the request of the doctors.
105
As the men discuss their obesity, an initially reticent Zelig joins in, swelling himself to a miraculous 250 pounds.
106
Next, in the presence of two Negro men,
107
Zelig rapidly becomes one himself.
108
What will they think of next?
109
Meanwhile, Americans all over have their own reactions.
110
I wish I could be Lenny Zelig, the changing man.
111
I'd be different people, and maybe someday my wishes will come true.
112
Leonard Zelig is one of the finest gentlemen in the United States of America!
113
He is the cat's pajamas!
114
Tell me why you assume the characteristics of the person you're with.
115
It's safe.
116
What do you mean? What do you mean, "safe"?
117
Safe to... To be like the others.
118
You want to be safe?
119
I wanna be liked.
120
Probing Zelig's unconscious, Dr. Fletcher gradually puts together the pieces of Zelig's behavioral puzzle.
121
Dividing her time between the hospital and the 42nd Street library, she writes her report.
122
A closed meeting of doctors listens as Dr. Fletcher describes Zelig as "a human chameleon."
123
Like the lizard that is endowed by nature with a marvelous protective device that enables it to change color and blend in with its immediate surrounding, Zelig, too, protects himself by becoming whoever he is around.
124
The doctors listen, and their reaction is skeptical.
125
"Impossible!" they claim."Preposterous!"
126
"If he's a lizard," quips one doctor, "then we should not spend good hospital money feeding him, "but simply catch him some flies."
127
We knew we had a good story this time 'cause it had everything in it. It had romance and it had suspense.
128
And then this fella, Zelig, you know, he grew up poor.
129
I remember my city editor came to me. He said "Ted, we want this story on page one every day."
130
And in those days, you'd do anything to sell papers.
131
To get a story, you'd jazz it up, exaggerate, even maybe play with the truth a little bit.
132
But here was a story. It was a natural.
133
You just told the truth and it sold papers. It never happened before.
134
Overnight, Leonard Zelig has become the main topic of conversation everywhere, and is discussed with amusement and wonder.
135
No social gathering is without its Leonard Zelig joke, and in a decade of popular dance crazes, a new one sweeps the nation.
136
What's brown and white and yellow and has four eyes?
137
Leonard Zelig at the League of Nations.
138
NARRATOR: Not everyone, however, was entranced by the human chameleon, and amongst the fanatics, he was a handy symbol of iniquity.
139
This creature personifies capitalist man!
140
A creature who takes many forms to achieve ends, the exploitation of the workers by deception.
141
To the Ku Klux Klan, Zelig, a Jew who was able to transform himself into a Negro or Indian, was a triple threat.
142
Meanwhile, Dr. Fletcher, certain that her findings are correct, begs for time with her patient to put her theories into operation.
143
Do you recall the first time you began behaving like the people you were around?
144
In school, some very bright people asked me if I read Moby Dick.
145
Yes? I was ashamed to say I never read it.
146
- And you pretended? - Yes.
147
When did the changes begin happening automatically?
148
Years ago. St. Patrick's Day.
149
Wandered into a bar. Wasn't wearing green.
150
They made remarks. I turned Irish.
151
You told them you were Irish?
152
My hair turned red, my nose turned up.
153
Spoke about the great potato famine and the little people.
154
We do not agree with Dr. Fletcher's ideas.
155
We believe those ideas are pipe dreams.
156
We believe that any change in Zelig's condition is going to be brought about through certain experimental drugs, which, although risky, have been known to work wonders.
157
Zelig is treated with the experimental drug Somadril hydrate.
158
He undergoes severe mood changes, and for several days will not come off the wall.
159
Then, suddenly, as Dr. Fletcher is beginning to make some progress, the question of Zelig's fate takes a new twist as his half-sister, Ruth, shocks everyone by removing him from the hospital.
160
He can be better cared for at home, she tells the doctors.
161
He will be looked after, she explains, by her and her dubious-looking lover, Martin Geist, a businessman and ex-carnival promoter.
162
There is very little resistance amongst the doctors, who are relieved to be rid of the frustrating case.
163
Only Dr. Fletcher cares about Zelig as a human being.
164
She insists he desperately needs special care, but it is to no avail.
165
No, no one was questioning her legal right to Zelig,
166
I mean, she was his half-sister and his guardian, but she had a strange boyfriend called Geist
167
that... He'd been in jail for real-estate fraud.
168
He was selling the same piece of property to a lot of the same people, and...
169
Matter of fact, a congressman from Delaware bought it twice.
170
NARRATOR: The crowds that lined the roads to glimpse the human chameleon tie up traffic for days.
171
He is a sight to behold for tourists and children.
172
People from all over the country fight for space to peek at this new wonderment.
173
Selling mementos while her brother is allowed to be on exhibition is only the beginning for Ruth Zelig and Martin Geist.
174
Admission is charged to twice-daily demonstrations of Leonard's stunning prowess.
175
He does not disappoint, changing appearance over and over upon demand.
176
Overnight, he has become an attraction, a novelty, a freak.
177
In this 1935 film based on the life of Zelig, called The Changing Man, the atmosphere is best summed up.
178
We can't give up custody of Leonard. I know if I'm given the chance, I can cure him.
179
It's no use. Even our attorney says it's hopeless.
180
Really, Dr. Fletcher. Uh... May I call you Eudora?
181
I tell you, somewhere behind that vacuous face, that zombie-like stare,
182
is a real human being, and I can bring it out.
183
- How? - I'll think up some new way.
184
Some technique. Whatever it is, it'll have to be personal.
185
There's not much I can do legally. I'll try, but...
186
They don't care about him. They'll exploit him.
187
All they see in him is a chance to make more money. Look at this.
188
Already they're selling this Leonard Zelig doll.
189
The film did not exaggerate. There were not only Leonard Zelig pens and lucky charms, but clocks and toys. There were Leonard Zelig watches and books, and a famous Leonard Zelig doll.
190
There were aprons, chameleon-shaped earmuffs and a popular Leonard Zelig game.
191
There were many popular songs inspired by Leonard Zelig, tunes that swept the nation.
192
In addition to the products and endorsements, there are the endless exhibitions.
193
In Hollywood, he is a great favorite and is offered a film contract.
194
Clara Bow invites him for a private weekend, and tells him to bring all his personalities.
195
In Chicago, he meets heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey, who clowns with Zelig at his training camp.
196
In Washington, DC, he is introduced to both Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover.
197
In France he is hailed as "Le LÃ©zard." He is the toast of the Parisian music halls.
198
His performance endears him as well to many leading French intellectuals, who see in him a symbol for everything.
199
His transformation into a rabbi is so realistic that certain Frenchmen suggest he be sent to Devil's Island.
200
At the Folies-BergÃ¨re, Josephine Baker does her version of the Chameleon dance, and later tells friends she finds Zelig amazing, but a little lost.
201
Everyone used to be at my place, that is, everyone who was someone. And occasionally, someone would bring Zelig in... Leonard in.
202
Cole Porter was fascinated by Leonard, and he once wrote a line in a song...
203
Uh..."You're the tops, you're Leonard Zelig." But then he couldn't find anything to rhyme with "Zelig."
204
I'm flyin' high 'Cause I've got a feelin' I'm fallin' Fallin' for nobody else but you
205
You caught my eye Now I got a feelin' I'm fallin'
206
Show me that ring and I'll jump right through
207
I used to travel single, oh We chanced to mingle, oh Now I'm a-tingle over you
208
Hey, Mr. Zelig, stand by 'Cause I've got a feelin' I'm fallin' Fallin' for nobody else but you, wow!
209
Though the shows and parties keep Zelig's sister and her lover rich and amused, Zelig's own existence is a nonexistence.
210
Devoid of personality, his human qualities long since lost in the shuffle of life, he sits alone, quietly staring into space, a cipher, a non-person, a performing freak.
211
He who wanted only to fit in, to belong, to go unseen by his enemies and be loved, neither fits in nor belongs, is supervised by enemies, and remains uncared for.
212
The board at the hospital has all but forgotten Zelig.
213
Only Dr. Fletcher continues to fight for his custody.
214
The court turns her final appeal down.
215
Throughout her valiant legal battle, she is frequently in the company of her attorney, Charles Koslow.
216
He falls in love with her and presses for her hand in marriage.
217
She is ambivalent.
218
Reluctantly, she is beginning to abandon all hope of recovering Leonard Zelig.
219
That summer, Geist has booked them in Spain.
220
It is the last leg of a European tour that has been wildly successful.
221
Relations between Martin Geist and Ruth Zelig have grown strained.
222
They have become bored with one another, and quarrel frequently.
223
The situation grows worse when she meets Luis Martinez, a mediocre and cowardly bullfighter with whom she falls in love.
224
Though he wishes to impress Ruth Zelig,
225
Martinez displays his usual panic in the arena.
226
Good fortune is with him, however, as the bull gives himself a brain concussion.
227
Martinez takes credit for the kill, and, cutting off the bull's ear, presents it to his lover with great bravado.
228
That evening, in a jealous rage, Martin Geist returns to his hotel room and confronts Ruth Zelig. He demands that she give him the ear.
229
She refuses. Geist insists upon possession of the ear.
230
They quarrel furiously, and Martinez is discovered hiding in the closet.
231
Geist pulls a revolver and shoots him.
232
He turns the gun on Zelig's half-sister and kills her, then he takes his own life. In an orgy of jealous violence, Leonard Zelig's life is turned upside down.
233
At first, the news reverberates around the world.
234
Then, just as quickly, the thrill-hungry public becomes apathetic.
235
Fresh scandals appear and make headlines.
236
Events in the Jazz Age move too rapidly, like Red Grange.
237
A population glutted with distractions is quick to forget.
238
The '20s come to a crashing climax, and still Leonard Zelig is nowhere to be found.
239
Dr. Eudora Fletcher searches in vain to locate him. When several leads prove disappointing, she gives up, discouraged.
240
I felt it was a shame, because here was this unique case that I could make my reputation on.
241
Not that I knew how to cure him, but if I could have him alone and feel my way and be innovative and creative,
242
I felt that I could change his life, if I only had the chance.
243
Borne on the shoulders of 12 attendants,
244
the seat of the gestatoria carrying the Holy Father is drawn out to the central balcony, where he bestows his blessing on Rome and all the world.
245
This is the first time that this ritual has been performed in 63 years, and brings to a climax on Easter Sunday the religious ceremonies of Holy Week.
246
Oh, but what's this? A commotion next to the Papal Father?
247
Somebody doesn't belong up there.
248
The guards are summoned amidst chaos, as His Holiness Pope Pius XI tries to swat the intruder with a sacred decree.
249
The faithful can't believe it.
250
It is, of course, Zelig.
251
He is returned to the United States by Italian authorities and readmitted to Manhattan Hospital.
252
"I welcome this opportunity to treat Leonard Zelig, "now that he's back as a ward of the hospital.
253
"I'm grateful that the board has given me this chance.
254
"I sincerely hope to return him to society a useful, self-possessed citizen "no longer a curiosity with no life of his own."
255
Dr. Fletcher has no time now to think of marriage. All her attention must be devoted to Leonard Zelig.
256
Her plan is to bring him to her country home.
257
She will set up a neutral environment away from society.
258
Here, she will begin searching for some new way to treat him in the hopes of penetrating his unique malady.
259
Aware of the significance of her work,
260
Eudora Fletcher arranges to keep a filmed record of the proceedings.
261
For this, she contacts her first cousin, Paul Deghuee, an inventor and part-time photographer.
262
And she said "I want to make a record of this case for future generations "and the world of science,
263
"and I want you to keep the camera very quiet."
264
And I said, "Why don't you just take notes and write it up?"
265
She said, "Paul, when a man changes his physical appearance, you want to see it.
266
"You can't read about it. Besides which, I am planning to make history."
267
The "White Room" is carefully arranged for maximum serenity.
268
It is a small study in Dr. Fletcher's house, sparsely furnished.
269
Clumsy photographic lights are nailed to the wall to provide sufficient illumination.
270
Microphones are hidden in specially selected places.
271
The camera shoots through a pane of glass which renders it relatively unobtrusive.
272
Only the noise of the motor is a problem, but this is muffled with a blanket and anything else handy.
273
From this cramped vantage point, photographer Paul Deghuee will record the famous "White Room Sessions, " a remarkable document in the history of psychotherapy.
274
By today's standards, the White Room Sessions would seem very primitive, and yet they were really quite effective in developing a very strong personal relation between doctor and patient.
275
The question whether Zelig was a psychotic or merely extremely neurotic was a question that was endlessly discussed among us doctors.
276
Now, I myself felt that, uh... His feelings were really not all that different from the normal, maybe what one would call the well-adjusted, normal person, only carried to an extreme degree, to an extreme extent.
277
I myself felt that one could really think of him as the ultimate conformist.
278
Leonard, do you know why you're here?
279
To discuss psychiatry, right?
280
You're a doctor?
281
Yes, I am. I am. Perhaps you've read my latest paper on delusional paranoia?
282
Turns out the entire thing is mental.
283
Now, suppose I tell you you're not a doctor.
284
Well, uh... I would say that you're making a joke.
285
Is it always so bright in here?
286
Oh, I'm recording these sessions on film, if you don't mind?
287
- No. Somebody's behind there, right? - Mmm-hmm. That's right.
288
- That's a camera.
289
Leonard... Leonard, why don't we start with simple reality?
290
- Leonard, you're not a doctor. - No?
291
No. You're a patient. I'm the doctor.
292
Well, I wouldn't tell that to too many people if I were you.
293
Leonard, you're not a doctor.
294
Is she gonna be all right? 'Cause... Is this a...
295
I've gotta get back to town. Really. I have an interesting case, treating two sets of Siamese twins with split personalities. I'm getting paid by eight people.
296
"The first week's sessions did not go too well, " writes Dr. Fletcher in her diary.
297
"Leonard identifies with me and is convinced that he is a doctor.
298
"He is guarded and suspicious.
299
"There is something appealing about him, too. He's quick-witted and energetic.
300
"Perhaps it is his very helplessness that moves me.
301
"I must keep flexible and play the situation by ear."
302
How are you today, Leonard?
303
Fine. And I... Uh... I gotta get back to town soon. You know,
304
I teach a course at the psychiatric institute in masturbation and...
305
- I see. - I'm a doctor, you know, and I... "Guilt-related masturbation." No, no, not guilt-related. I... I teach advanced.
306
- I'm quite a respected doctor there. - Leonard, I'd like you... ...eyes follow this pen and just let yourself breathe deeply.
307
- Why? What... - Relax.
308
No. You're trying to hypnotize me, obviously.
309
- Do you mind? - Of course I mind. I'm a doctor. I'm...
310
- Leonard, you're not a doctor. - I am a doctor!
311
- Just relax. - No, I can't. I'm... I'm due back in town.
312
I... I have this masturbation class.
313
If I'm not there, they start without me.
314
As the weeks go by, Dr. Fletcher grows more and more frustrated.
315
"Leonard continues to insist he is a doctor, "and even refuses to let me hypnotize him," she writes.
316
"I believe his experiences of the past year "have made him more defensive than ever. It is discouraging."
317
She was under great pressure, you could tell. She was moody and nervous. He was fine. Napping, sitting in his chair reading... He used to refer to himself as Dr. Zelig. He was reading books on psychiatry.
318
I told her "You'd better get away for a day and relax. "The strain is becoming too much for you."
319
Leaving Zelig alone, Dr. Fletcher takes Paul Deghuee's advice and she and her fiancÃ© spend some hours off relaxing.
320
They go to Broadway, then to a well-known nightclub, where, despite a lively stage show, Dr. Fletcher is distracted and uneasy.
321
She is unable to think of anything but her patient.
322
The atmosphere with her fiancÃ©, Koslow, is awkward and strained.
323
He is put off by her total obsession with Zelig.
324
Ironically, it is in the noisy and smoke-filled atmosphere of the nightclub that Eudora Fletcher is struck by a brilliant and innovative plan that will create a major breakthrough in the case.
325
- Dr. Zelig? - Yes?
326
I... I wonder if you could help me with a problem.
327
Well, I'll certainly try. Of course, we can't promise anything, you know.
328
You see, last week I was with a group of fairly erudite people who were discussing the novel Moby Dick, and I... I was afraid to admit that I hadn't read it, so I lied.
329
You see, I want so badly to be liked, to be like other people so that I don't stand out.
330
- That's natural. - I go to such extreme lengths to blend in.
331
Well... You're a doctor, you know? You... should know how to handle that.
332
No, but the truth of the matter is, I... I'm not an actual doctor.
333
- You're not? - No, Doctor.
334
No, I've... I've been pretending to be a doctor to fit in with my friends.
335
You see, they're doctors.
336
That's... That's something.
337
But you're a doctor, and you can help me. You have to help me.
338
Actually... I don't feel that well, actually.
339
But my... My whole life's just been a lie.
340
I've been posing as one thing after another.
341
Well, you... You need help, lady. Um...
342
Last night... Last night, I dreamt that I was falling into fire.
343
What does that mean?
344
That's terrible. I don't know. You know, I... Please, Doctor. I know I'm a very complicated patient.
345
- Jesus. I don't feel that well. - What am I suffering from?
346
How should I know? I'm not a doctor.
347
- You're not? - No. Am I?
348
- Who are you? - What do you mean, who am I?
349
- I don't know. These are tough questions. - Leonard Zelig.
350
- Yes, definitely. Who is he? - You.
351
No. I'm nobody. I'm nothing.
352
Catch me, I'm falling.
353
Playing on Zelig's identity disorder,
354
Dr. Fletcher has manipulated him into momentary disorientation.
355
With his guard lowered, she quickly puts him under hypnosis.
356
Using posthypnotic suggestion, she will now be able to induce a trance at will.
357
My brother beat me.
358
My sister beat my brother.
359
My father beat my sister and my brother and me.
360
My mother beat my father and my sister and me and my brother.
361
The neighbors beat our family.
362
People down the block beat the neighbors and our family.
363
I'm 12 years old.
364
I run into a synagogue.
365
I ask the rabbi the meaning of life.
366
He tells me the meaning of life, but he tells it to me in Hebrew.
367
I don't understand Hebrew.
368
Then he wants to charge me $600 for Hebrew lessons.
369
Dr. Fletcher's therapy consists of a two-pronged attack.
370
In the trance state, the personality will be deeply probed and then restructured. In the conscious state, she will provide love and affection, unconditional positive regard.
371
You will be completely honest.
372
You're in a deep trance.
373
You will become, not who you think I want you to be, but you'll be yourself.
374
Now, how do you feel about it here?
375
It's the worst.
376
I hate the country.
377
I hate the grass and the mosquitoes.
378
And cooking... Your cooking is terrible.
379
Your pancakes...
380
They're... I dump them in the garbage when you're not looking.
381
- Uh-huh. - And the jokes you try and tell when... When you think you're amusing, they're long and pointless, there's no end to them.
382
I see. And what else?
383
I wanna go to bed with you.
384
Oh... That surprises me. I didn't think you liked me very much.
385
I love you.
386
You do?
387
You're very sweet, 'cause you're... You're not as clever as you think you are.
388
You're all mixed up, and nervous, and you're the worst cook.
389
Those pancakes...
390
Oh, I love you.
391
I wanna take care of you.
392
No more pancakes.
393
I started out by trying to use Leonard to make my reputation, and then I found that I had very strong feelings for him.
394
I never thought I was attractive.
395
I never had a real romance.
396
Charles Koslow was the type of man my mother felt I should marry.
397
Feeling more confident every day with her patient, Dr. Fletcher takes him for a cautious outing, an afternoon at her sister's house in nearby Teaneck.
398
Meryl Fletcher is an aviatrix, a fine professional pilot.
399
Eudora Fletcher is an amateur pilot, and the afternoon is spent relaxing and retelling old flying experiences.
400
As the weeks pass, Zelig is encouraged to open up more and more, to give his own opinions.
401
What was guarded at first soon becomes expansive.
402
I hated my stepmother, and I don't care who knows it.
403
I love baseball.
404
You know, it doesn't have to mean anything, it's just very beautiful to watch.
405
I'm a Democrat. I always was a Democrat.
406
Is it okay if I don't agree with you about that recording?
407
Of course. I mean, Brahms is just always too melodramatic for me.
408
You have to be your own person and make your own moral choices, even when they do require real courage, otherwise you're like a robot, or a lizard.
409
Are you really gonna get married to that lawyer?
410
I... I would much rather you didn't.
411
No, I don't agree. I think this guy Mussolini is a loser.
412
Uh... Are we ever gonna make love?
413
It has been three months, and the board wishes to examine the patient.
414
Dr. Fletcher says Zelig is not ready to leave the premises.
415
The doctors agree to visit him there.
416
The date is set, four days hence.
417
If progress is insufficient, she will be removed from the case.
418
I was very nervous, because in his waking state he never remembered anything from his trance state, and I wondered if there could be some way of locking these two things together.
419
And then I also was worried that if he was with strong personalities, he might lose his personality.
420
Sunday at noon. The doctors arrive.
421
They are greeted by Eudora Fletcher and Leonard Zelig and are shown around the grounds.
422
Though Dr. Fletcher is tense and alert,
423
Leonard Zelig seems calm and at ease.
424
Despite the fact that he is surrounded by physicians, he does not turn into one.
425
The encounter appears to be a resounding success, when Dr. Henry Mayerson comments innocently about the weather, saying that it is a nice day.
426
Zelig tells Dr. Mayerson that he does not agree that it is a nice day.
427
Dr. Mayerson is taken aback at the firmness of Zelig's conviction.
428
He points out that the sun is shining and that it is mild.
429
Zelig, trained to voice his own personal opinions fearlessly, is too aggressive. He has been molded too far in the other direction. He has become over-opinionated, and cannot brook any disagreement with his own views.
430
I had taken him too far in the other direction.
431
He had struck Dr. Mayerson and several board members with a rake.
432
This was not what we wanted, and yet I felt that I had accomplished something.
433
I felt if I could have him for two more weeks, I could do some fine-tuning and turn Leonard Zelig back into his own man.
434
Dr. Eudora Nesbit Fletcher, the hero, or should we say heroine, of the hour.
435
The beautiful and brilliant psychiatrist never lost faith in her conviction that Leonard Zelig, the human chameleon, was suffering from a mental disorder.
436
Working with her cousin, cameraman Paul Deghuee, the doctor managed to keep a vital record of the proceedings including rare footage of Zelig hypnotized.
437
The patient and his healer have become fast friends in the process, and enjoy one another's company even when she's not working on him.
438
The result of maintaining a courageous minority opinion is a resounding success for psychiatry.
439
Who says women are just good for sewing?
440
Now it's on to City Hall, where the town's newest celebrities are given the key to the city.
441
We're honored to present this key to New York City to the two of you.
442
And, uh... Jimmy Walker did wanna be here this afternoon and sing Leonard the Lizard, but he was just too busy.
443
After City Hall, Eudora Fletcher, the beautiful genius who cured Zelig of his science-defying condition, is honored by fellow scientists at New York's Waldorf-Astoria.
444
Present are luminaries from all over the world, not just in the field of psychiatry, but physics, biology, mathematics, and you name it.
445
Here she is exchanging theories with Nils Andersen, the father of modern blood disease.
446
Later in the week, Dr. Fletcher is again honored by the greatest city in the world, as she gets to christen her first ship.
447
Quite a success story for a little girl from the backwoods.
448
I'm speaking to you from the home of Mrs. Catherine Fletcher. She's the mother of Dr. Eudora Fletcher, the famous psychiatrist so much in the news these days.
449
And I'm going to be asking Mrs. Fletcher to... To begin with, to tell us something about what it's like to raise a medical genius. And I might ask you about the many sacrifices that you've made to put your daughter through medical school.
450
And could you speak right into the microphones, please?
451
Sacrifices, we had none. John was a stockbroker, he had plenty of money, and I came from a wealthy Philadelphia family, so...
452
Well, I'm sure that your daughter always wanted to be a doctor, ever since she could remember.
453
I don't think so.
454
I always thought she'd want to be a flier like her sister Meryl and raise a family. - But she was a very moody... - But still, a mother always dreams for her child to have the kind of success that your daughter has.
455
- She was a very difficult girl. - Well, tell me about your husband.
456
I understand that he is a simple businessman.
457
He must be so thrilled and pleased
458
to have his daughter achieve such recognition.
459
John had problems, depression. He drank.
460
Well, Mrs. Fletcher, thank you so much for speaking with us today.
461
Here at San Simeon, glorious dreamland of newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst, celebrities from all walks of society, sun or play.
462
There's Marie Dressler with Mr. Hearst. Always a popular guest at San Simeon,
463
Miss Dressler accepts a flower from an ardent admirer.
464
Along with her is Marion Davies.
465
When she works, Miss Davies is always dead serious, but here at this fabulous playground, she shows us her fun side.
466
There she is with you-know-who, Charlie Chaplin, always kidding.
467
Although New York is 3,000 miles away,
468
Jimmy Walker somehow appears through Mr. Hearst's enchanted gateway.
469
Another New Yorker is Leonard Zelig, here shown clowning with everybody's favorite cowboy, Tom Mix.
470
Won't Tony be jealous?
471
Tony is Tom's horse, and we always thought they went everywhere together.
472
There's that fellow Chaplin again, this time with Adolphe Menjou.
473
There's Claire Windsor and Dolores del Rio, and a very charming Eudora Fletcher chatting with Hollywood's newest dancing sensation, James Cagney.
474
Oh, and what have we here?
475
Only a beautiful lady named Carole Lombard.
476
And there's Dr. Fletcher and Leonard Zelig hitting a few with Bobby Jones on Mr. Hearst's golf course.
477
Unless Leonard can go back to his old chameleon personality and turn into a golf pro, I'd bet my money on Bobby.
478
But who cares, if they're having fun?
479
Leonard Zelig, do you want to give the kids of this country some advice?
480
I sure do. Kids, you gotta be yourself. You know, you can't act like anybody else just because you think that they have all the answers and you don't.
481
You have to be your own man and learn to speak up and say what's on your mind.
482
Now, maybe they're not free to do that in foreign countries, but that's the American way.
483
And you can take it from me, because I used to be a member of the reptile family, but I'm not anymore.
484
Zelig, no longer a chameleon, is at last his own man.
485
His point of view on politics, art, life and love is honest and direct.
486
Though his taste is described by many as lowbrow, it is his own.
487
He is finally an individual, a human being.
488
He no longer gives up his own identity to be a safe and invisible part of his surroundings.
489
Oh, his taste wasn't terrible.
490
He was the kind of man who preferred watching baseball to reading Moby Dick. And that got him off on the wrong foot, or so the legend goes.
491
It was much more a matter of symbolism. To the Marxists, he was one thing.
492
The Catholic Church never forgave him for the Vatican incident.
493
The American people, in the throes of the Depression as they were, found in him a symbol of possibility, of self-improvement and self-fulfillment.
494
And of course, the Freudians had a ball. They could interpret him in any way they pleased.
495
It was all symbolism, but there were no two intellectuals who agreed about what it meant.
496
I don't know if you could call it a triumph of psychotherapy. It seems more like a triumph of aesthetic instincts, because Dr. Fletcher's techniques didn't owe anything to then-current schools of therapy.
497
But she sensed what was needed and she provided it, and that was, in its way, a remarkable creative accomplishment.
498
When I think about it, it seems to me that his story reflected a lot of the Jewish experience in America, the great urge to push in and to find one's place and then to assimilate into the culture.
499
I mean, he wanted to assimilate like crazy.
500
Eudora Fletcher's life has also changed from this experience.
501
For her, fame and recognition are empty rewards and do not live up to the adolescent fantasies that prompted her ambition.
502
She and her patient have fallen in love, and it is no surprise when she forsakes the upwardly mobile attorney Koslow and announces wedding plans with Zelig.
503
It was wonderful to see my sister and Leonard together.
504
She drew strength from him, and they were so much in love with each other. She looked happier than she had in years.
505
I remember they decided to get married in the spring, and then, of course, the roof fell in.
506
Two weeks before the wedding, an ex-showgirl named Lita Fox comes forth and claims that she is married to Zelig.
507
She also claims to have had his child.
508
It is an immediate scandal.
509
We were married a year ago. He said he was an actor.
510
He sounded just like one, and I'm in show business, too.
511
So we drove to Baltimore and we were married, and I have a license to prove it.
512
He had married her while under a different personality.
513
When she read of the plans for his forthcoming wedding to Eudora Fletcher, she was mortified and decided to take legal action.
514
Zelig says he will fight it in court, but public opinion begins subtly to shift away from him.
515
Clever attorneys portray Lita Fox as an abandoned woman.
516
The child is neglected, poor and fatherless.
517
Zelig has sold his life story to Hollywood for a large sum of money.
518
When the scandal breaks, the studio demands its money back.
519
Zelig can only return half as the rest has already been spent.
520
Outraged, the studio gives him half his life back. They keep the best moments, and he is left with only his sleeping hours and mealtimes.
521
Zelig is shaken by the scandal, but it is only the beginning.
522
Now another woman steps forward. Helen Gray, a salesgirl from a Wisconsin gift shop claims that Zelig is the father of her twins.
523
She tells her lawyers that he passed himself off as a fur trapper.
524
Zelig has no recollection, but admits it could have happened when he was under one of his spells.
525
It is the signal for the floodgates to open.
526
He married me up at the First Church of Harlem.
527
He told me he was the brother of Duke Ellington.
528
He was the guy who smashed my car up. It was brand-new.
529
Then he backed up over my mother's wrist.
530
She's elderly, and uses her wrist a lot.
531
He painted my house a disgusting color. He said he was a painter. I couldn't believe the results. Then he disappeared.
532
That Zelig could be responsible for the behavior of each of the personalities he assumed means dozens of lawsuits.
533
He is sued for bigamy, adultery, automobile accidents, plagiarism, household damages, negligence, property damages, and performing unnecessary dental extractions.
534
I would like to apologize to everyone.
535
I'm awfully sorry for marrying all those women.
536
It just... I don't know, it just seemed like the thing to do.
537
And to the gentleman whose appendix I took out, I'm... I don't know what to say.
538
If it's any consolation, I may still have it somewhere around the house.
539
My deepest apology goes to the Trokman family in Detroit.
540
I... I never delivered a baby before in my life, and I, I just thought that ice tongs was the way to do it.
541
Thriving mercilessly on loopholes and technicalities, the American legal profession has a field day.
542
Zelig is branded a criminal. Despite Dr. Fletcher's insistence that he cannot be held responsible for his actions while in his chameleon state, it is no use.
543
Leonard Zelig sets a bad moral influence. America is a moral country. It's a God-fearing country.
544
We don't condone scandals, scandals of fraud and polygamy.
545
In keeping with a pure society, I say lynch the little Hebe!
546
Throughout the humiliating ordeal, Eudora Fletcher stands by the man she loves, valiantly.
547
Privately, she tells friends that she is worried about Zelig's emotional condition, which seems to her to be deteriorating under the weight of conservative moral opinion.
548
In public, he tries to keep up an appearance of composure, but it is increasingly difficult.
549
It is clear he is coming apart when he and Eudora Fletcher dine at a Greek restaurant, and in the midst of the meal, Zelig begins to turn Greek.
550
He longs desperately to be liked once again, to be accepted, to fit in.
551
Public clamor over his morality reaches a fever pitch, and on the eve of his sentencing, Leonard Zelig vanishes.
552
This is Chief Inspector of Police Thomas Dowd with a national broadcasting news break.
553
Leonard Zelig is missing. On the eve of his sentencing for an assortment of crimes and misdemeanors ranging from polygamy to fraud, he has disappeared.
554
We are searching for clues and would appreciate speaking with anyone who might have any information leading to his apprehension.
555
My sister was just shattered.
556
She tried, you know, she tried to keep up a calm front but she was just too upset.
557
And she wasn't a person who usually displayed emotion easily, except where Leonard was concerned.
558
Dr. Fletcher and the police confer daily. Together they make public appeals to anyone who might know of his whereabouts.
559
Apart from several crank telephone calls, there is little response.
560
Months go by and Zelig is not heard from.
561
Cars are searched. False leads pour in from everywhere.
562
His jacket is recovered in Texas. A manhunt in that state proves futile.
563
He is reported seen in Chicago, in California.
564
This still photo appears to have a man resembling him with a mariachi band in Mexico.
565
Dr. Fletcher continues to search for Zelig, but hopes fade with each passing day.
566
All I could think of was Leonard and how much I missed him and loved him, and of all the terrific times we'd spent together.
567
It was really a very painful time for me.
568
The year ends, and Zelig is still missing.
569
I just moped around and wept.
570
And one night, after a very bad time, my sister Meryl said to me, "Come on, let's go out for dinner. "Let's go to a concert." I said, "No, I can't do it." But she insisted.
571
And we went out and finally ended up in a movie.
572
We saw Grand Hotel and with it, there was a newsreel.
573
Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist Party continue to consolidate gains in Depression-ridden Berlin.
574
Denouncing the Treaty of Versailles, the Nazis make fervent appeals to German patriotism, promising to rebuild...
575
Eudora Fletcher is stunned by what she sees.
576
Amongst the Brownshirts, she spots a figure who could be Zelig.
577
Yes, but then it really made sense, it made all the sense in the world, because although he wanted to be loved, craved to be loved, there was also something in him that desired immersion in the mass and anonymity, and fascism offered Zelig that kind of opportunity. So he could make something anonymous of himself by belonging to this vast movement.
578
She sails for Europe the following week. Ten days later, she arrives in Berlin.
579
Germany is a country deep in the throes of the Depression.
580
Militarism and unrest are in the air.
581
She searches everywhere and makes enquiries, but it is impossible.
582
After three weeks, the authorities begin to get suspicious.
583
They watch her. While she is out, they search her hotel room.
584
A fourth week goes by, and she is about to give up and go home, when news of a large rally at Munich catches her attention.
585
It is rumored that it will be the largest gathering to date of Nazi personnel.
586
Eudora Fletcher is counting on the hope that Zelig may also attend. And that if she can confront him, the strong feeling he has always had for her can be awakened.
587
At first, all appears hopeless. The crowd is huge, and it seems impossible to locate any one particular face. Then, suddenly, a figure flanking the Chancellor captures her attention.
588
Behind and to the right of Hitler, she spots Zelig.
589
Struggling to make contact, she manages to catch his eye.
590
Like a man emerging from a dream, Zelig notices her.
591
In a matter of seconds, everything comes back to him.
592
It was nothing like it happened in the movie.
593
When Leonard came down from the podium, they didn't know what to think.
594
We couldn't believe our eyes. Hitler's speech was ruined.
595
He wanted to make a good joke about Poland, but just then, Zelig interfered and Hitler was extremely upset.
596
The SS wanted to grab Zelig, but if they would have grabbed him, they probably would have tortured him, or maybe even shot him.
597
In the confusion, Fletcher and Zelig got out of the building through a side door.
598
They grabbed a car. They sped away in the car, and the SS after them, shot them...
599
In rare German newsreel footage, a quick glimpse of the escape was recorded.
600
I was flying! It was wonderful. And then... Suddenly, something happened. I was frightened. I lost control. We went into a dive.
601
Leonard was so terrified that he changed his personality, and before my eyes, because I was a pilot, he turned into one, too.
602
Zelig takes control of the airplane. Acting the role of pilot, he struggles valiantly with the aircraft.
603
The Germans, who are stunned, take a full 15 minutes before they follow in hot pursuit of their quarry.
604
With Eudora Fletcher unconscious, Zelig, who had never flown before in his life, not only escapes the German pilots, but sets a record for flying nonstop across the Atlantic upside down.
605
New York welcomes back Eudora Fletcher and Leonard Zelig, the human chameleon.
606
His remarkable feat of aviation fills the nation with pride and earns him a full presidential pardon.
607
Forgiving multitudes flock to see him as he sits by the side of his plucky bride-to-be.
608
Their journey of triumph leads to City Hall.
609
New York's greatest honor, the Medal of Valor, is bestowed on Zelig by Carter Dean.
610
You are a great inspiration to the young of this nation who will one day grow up and be great doctors and great patients.
611
This is a great thrill.
612
I'm glad we lived to see this day.
613
I've never flown before in my life, and it shows exactly what you can do if you're a total psychotic.
614
The thing was paradoxical, because what enabled him to perform this astounding feat was his ability to transform himself.
615
Therefore, his sickness was also at the root of his salvation, and I think it's interesting to view the thing that way, that it was his very disorder that made a hero of him.
616
It was really absurd in a way.
617
I mean, he had this curious quirk, this strange characteristic, and for a time, everyone loved him, and then people stopped loving him, and then he did this stunt, you know, with the airplane, and then everybody loved him again, and that was what the '20s were like.
618
When you think about it, has America changed so much? I don't think so.
619
After untangling countless legal details,
620
Leonard Zelig and Eudora Fletcher marry.
621
It is a simple ceremony, captured on home movies.
622
"Wanting only to be liked, he distorted himself beyond measure, " wrote Scott Fitzgerald.
623
"One wonders what would have happened if, right at the outset, "he had had the courage to speak his mind and not pretend.
624
"In the end it was, after all, "not the approbation of many, but the love of one woman that changed his life."
625
