1
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,840
Hold on. I gotta come up.

2
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,180
I gotta take the world's
biggest fucking piss.

3
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,010
We can't be late.

4
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,220
We won't!

5
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:30,040
- Who's holding?
- lf you're not then nobody.

6
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,750
We were kind of hoping you were.

7
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,420
- Yeah. How are you not holding?
- Jesus Christ Shanna.

8
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,590
It is not my fucking job to supply y'all
with weed when we go out.

9
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,010
Whoa whoa whoa whoa little lady.

10
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,840
You're getting angry kind of quick
don't you think?

11
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,050
- l was just teasing you.
- l'm not angry.

12
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,760
It just would be nice if y'all didn't
just count on me all the fucking time

13
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,270
and surprise me
every once in a while with pot.

14
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:53,770
Okay mean girl in a high school movie.
Are you through having a tantrum?

15
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,060
- l'm not having a tantrum.
- Yes you are.

16
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:59,070
You've been in the car all of two seconds
and you're already cursing at me.

17
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:04,780
- l am not cursing at you.
- You said "Jesus Christ Shanna."

18
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,370
And then
before the sentence was over

19
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:09,080
you threw a "fucking" in there
to emphasize your "irritatance."

20
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,450
All right. Come on guys. Don't fight.
I'll pay for it when we get some.

21
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,250
One: It is not about the money.

22
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,580
It is about the pain in the ass of scoring.

23
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,460
And two: We're not really fighting.

24
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,590
Arlene have you forgotten
what hanging out with Jungle Julia's like?

25
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,840
That wasn't a fight.

26
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,680
That was Julia
acting like a grumpy bitch

27
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,810
and me calling her on it
and indulging her at the same time.

28
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,480
That's how we tolerate each other
after all these years.

29
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,640
Oh billboard.

30
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,020
So what's the plan man?

31
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,110
Margaritas and Mexican food at Guero's.

32
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,070
Did you call Rafael
and tell him we're coming?

33
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,360
- Of course.
- You're so good.

34
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,860
I know.

35
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,660
Okay is Christian Simonson
gonna be there?

36
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,950
You bet your ass he is.
He's gonna be there with Jesse Letterman.

37
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,040
Christian Simonson
the filmmaker is in town.

38
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,380
He's got a big thing for Julia.

39
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,340
If he had a big thing for me
he'd fucking call me

40
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,800
as opposed to disappearing
for six months

41
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,010
and he'd get his ass down here
more often than he does

42
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,720
and on my birthday
give me a fucking phone call.

43
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,220
Oh billboard.

44
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:18,810
Yeah but you get those legs
of yours around him and it's all over.

45
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,860
Yeah well when l'm redecorating
his house in the hills

46
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,650
that l am also living in
I'll let you know it worked.

47
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,320
So margaritas and Mexican food at Guero's
touch base with Chris and Jesse

48
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,620
tell them about later
and make damn sure they come.

49
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,790
Those other guys will be waiting for us
to join them at the Texas Chili Parlor.

50
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,330
Oh shit.

51
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:39,000
Speaking of which what happened
with you and Nate last night?

52
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,790
Well you know not mu--
We just fucking met each other.

53
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,170
I mean if you don't bust their balls a
little bit they're never gonna respect you.

54
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,380
Okay we're pretty clear
on what it is you didn't do.

55
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,840
How about enlightening us
on what it is you did do?

56
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,640
Nothing to write home about.

57
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,890
We just made out on the couch
for about 20 minutes.

58
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,560
Dressed half-dressed or naked?

59
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,100
Dressed. I said we made out.

60
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,940
We didn't do the thing.

61
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,190
Excuse me for living
but what is "the thing"?

62
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,070
You know it's everything but.

63
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,570
They call it "the thing"?

64
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,610
I call it "the thing."

65
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,410
Do guys like the thing?

66
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,870
They like it better than no thing.

67
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,200
Okay l wanna get back
to what it is you did do.

68
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,370
So you're making out
on the couch with Nate right?

69
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,460
- Correct.
- Whose couch?

70
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,630
- His or the one in your hotel room?
- What am I stupid over here? Mine.

71
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,380
Were you making out
sitting up or lying down?

72
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,220
We started sitting up.
We worked our way to lying down.

73
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,930
Mmm the plot thickens.
Who was on top?

74
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:32,390
I was straddling him.

75
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,470
- What else?
- That was it.

76
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,810
So we made out
for a little while on the couch

77
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:41,600
and I said "Okay l'm gonna go to bed now
so it's time for you to leave."

78
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,230
And then he starts to whine
"Oh right now?"

79
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,400
And l said "Yep right now.
Let's go."

80
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,110
And he says
"Well wait. What about this?"

81
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,240
And I said "No."

82
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,620
He said "What do you mean no?
You don't even know what l'm gonna say."

83
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,160
I said "l already know
what you're gonna say

84
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,540
and the answer's no."

85
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,450
He said "How can you say
you know what I'm gonna say?"

86
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,750
I said "Because you're gonna say
'let's just go to sleep together.

87
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,210
"'We don't gotta do nothing.

88
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:05,210
"'Just cuddle sleep next to each other
wake up in the morning together.'

89
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:08,260
No you're gonna leave
but I'll see you tomorrow."

90
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,880
Yeah fuck Nate.

91
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,050
I mean he's cute and all

92
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,140
but Jesse Letterman's
gonna be all over her.

93
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:17,720
- Jesse Letterman--
- Remember no hooking up tonight.

94
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:21,100
You can hang out with him
you can make out with him

95
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:26,570
but no hooking up with him
because we are driving to Lake LBJ tonight

96
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,900
and my daddy's pretty clear
about one thing.

97
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:33,870
He said "l am letting you
and your girlfriends stay at my lake house

98
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:37,910
not you and a bunch of horny boys trying
to get their fuck on with my daughter."

99
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,910
- Your dad talks like that?
- Hell yeah!

100
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,710
It's not like he ain't gonna know either

101
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:46,670
because when I'm staying at the lake house
with my girlfriends in our bikinis

102
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,340
Daddy just has a tendency to pop up
and make sure we don't need anything.

103
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,850
Look he's totally harmless
and cute as a bug's ear.

104
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,600
But you know when he's got
a bunch of half-naked poontang

105
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,770
walking the floor of his lake house

106
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:04,020
he just likes to pay us a visit
and make sure we got everything we need.

107
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,520
And if you flirt shamelessly with him like
the six-foot baby giraffe in the backseat

108
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,440
you got a puppy dog for life.

109
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,320
I have my own relationship
with Ben

110
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,320
and you're just jealous
'cause it don't include you.

111
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,780
- You call her dad Ben?
- l'm not a child. That's his name.

112
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,080
So when are the boys showing up?

113
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,330
They're gonna meet us
at the Chili Parlor.

114
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,710
Maybe they can bring some pot.

115
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,330
Fuck that. No.

116
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,840
I don't wanna be either
A depending on their fucking ass

117
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,500
or B depending on their ass.

118
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,710
Uh-uh. We don't score ourselves

119
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,090
we're gonna be stuck
with them all fucking night.

120
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,340
Ooh try Lanna Frank.

121
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:37,050
Best idea you had all day.

122
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,680
Oh hey that's your last billboard
before Guero's.

123
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,230
Oh come on.
Give me a break.

124
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:44,890
"Oh come on" my ass!
We said every time.

125
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,270
Okay.

126
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,540
Jules let me get a drag?
Thanks.

127
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,740
Oh my God!

128
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,660
Hey this is--
and I's U .T. days Arlene.

129
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,740
- Hey.
- Hey.

130
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,410
- You wanna join us?
- For a second but l'm with some friends.

131
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,540
Oh.

132
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,660
So you must be-- must be--

133
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,630
So you must be the infamous Butterfly.

134
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,840
Shh!

135
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,800
She don't know nothing about it.

136
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,710
- Know about what?
- When were y'all gonna tell her?

137
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,880
- Soon.
- Tell me what?

138
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,630
Yeah now thanks to you
we gotta tell her sooner than later.

139
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,390
All right cut the shit.
What the fuck is going on?

140
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,100
I said a little somethin'-somethin'
about you on the air today.

141
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,600
Julia what the fuck did you say
about me on the radio?

142
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,230
All I said was I had
a sexy friend named Butterfly

143
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,150
who was in from out of town
for the weekend

144
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,900
and we would be going out
somewhere in Austin tonight

145
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,440
and if they were out on the town
maybe they'd see us.

146
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:21,450
And l described you and I said
that if they spotted you while we were out

147
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,990
if they'd do something
you'd do something.

148
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,450
Okay now Julia I'm serious.

149
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,120
What did you say
and what did you say l'd do?

150
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:32,130
Anyhoo l could explain what l said
which would be boring

151
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,460
or Marcy over here

152
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,090
who is an incredible actress
could act it out for you

153
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,260
which I think
will give you a better idea

154
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,260
of what you have in store
for you tonight.

155
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,390
Okay so just tell me your way.

156
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,470
- So we'll act it out with Marcy?
- Sure.

157
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,680
Okay give Marcy your drink.

158
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,230
Thank you.

159
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:52,860
Okay so you're in a club or a bar

160
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,690
and Marcy's a kind of cute
or kind of hot or kind of sexy

161
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,990
or better be fucking hysterically funny
but not funny-looking guy

162
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,780
who you could fuck.

163
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,240
- Got it.
- Okay Marcy take it.

164
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,460
Howdy.

165
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,800
Hi there.

166
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:21,260
Excuse me but your name
wouldn't be Butterfly would it?

167
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,680
Yes it is. lt seems you have me
at a disadvantage.

168
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,220
Barry.

169
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,430
Pleased to meet you Barry.

170
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,600
- Y'all are getting me hot.
- Shh!

171
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,980
So is uh Butterfly your real name?

172
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,860
Yes it is.

173
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,780
And how'd you know my name Barry?

174
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,700
I listened to Jungle Julia's show
this morning.

175
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,450
Oh you did did you?

176
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,290
Oh yeah. l listen to her show
every morning.

177
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,450
Oh you do do you?

178
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,460
Yeah. She's like
the coolest lady in town.

179
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,000
Don't you think she's got a big ass?

180
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,710
Nah man.

181
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,550
I like her ass that way.

182
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:02,260
She got a black girl's ass.

183
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,430
Well that's what she always says
but natural fact

184
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,550
she doesn't really have
a black girl's ass.

185
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,720
- She's got a big ass.
- Okay what the fuck are you doing?

186
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:12,180
Oh look who wants to get
to the point all of a sudden.

187
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,350
Okay we'll get to the point.

188
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,270
But for your information
skinny bitch

189
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:18,190
black men and a whole lot
of motherfucking white men

190
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,070
have had plenty fun
adoring my ass.

191
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,950
I don't wear their teeth marks
on my butt for nothing.

192
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,410
All right if you're not gonna
buy me a drink can I have mine back?

193
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,910
No. Okay okay okay okay.

194
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,120
So Butterfly can I buy you a drink?

195
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,290
- l'd love one.
- What can l get you?

196
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,960
I'll take a margarita.

197
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,420
Here you go.

198
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,760
So after they buy you a drink

199
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,590
when they raise their glass to toast

200
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,800
they look you dead in the eye

201
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:49,560
and repeat this poem:

202
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,770
"The woods are lovely
dark and deep

203
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:58,900
"and l have promises to keep
and miles to go before I sleep.

204
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,860
"Did you hear me Butterfly?

205
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:04,110
Miles to go before you sleep."

206
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,950
And then if they say that...

207
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,660
you gotta give them a lap dance.

208
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,870
What?

209
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,830
If they call you Butterfly
buy you a drink

210
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,000
repeat that poem
you gotta give them a lap dance.

211
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,960
That's bullshit.
I ain't giving them nothing.

212
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,790
Well you can do it or not
but if you don't

213
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,550
everybody in Austin's
gonna think you're a chickenshit.

214
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,800
And l don't think you want everybody
in Austin thinking you're a chickenshit.

215
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,640
I ain't giving nobody no lap dance
'cause of what you said.

216
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,050
Oh come on.
It's gonna be funny.

217
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,890
Yeah everything's funny to you two
when it's happening to me.

218
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:35,430
Look you don't have to do it
for anybody you don't want.

219
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,600
l said you'd do it
for the first guy who says it.

220
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,650
So some geek comes over
trying to be cool

221
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,570
just tell him you already did it
at another place earlier.

222
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:47,240
No harm no foul
but you get a free drink out of it.

223
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,870
But maybe a little later
in the evening

224
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:53,660
you've had a few drinks
you're kind of loosey-goosey

225
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,830
you're safe with your girls

226
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:59,670
then some kind of cute kind of hot
kind of sexy hysterically funny

227
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,670
but not funny-looking guy
comes up and says it

228
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:06,260
then maybe you did it earlier
maybe you didn't.

229
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,310
You made me trip.

230
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:18,100
You made me trip
you dumb bitch!

231
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,730
Shut the--

232
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,990
You fuckin' idiot!

233
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,970
Any dead soldiers here?

234
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,970
Uh these two. Thank you.

235
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,600
Where the hell is Lanna Frank?

236
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,680
That's a good fucking question.

237
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,030
Lanna Frank!

238
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,450
Where are you?

239
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,740
Well come over already.
We're waiting for you.

240
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,040
Shit!

241
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,000
Hold on!

242
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,010
So where are you?

243
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:00,010
Come over already.
We're waiting for you.

244
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,140
No we're not coming over there.

245
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,230
You come over here
like you said you would.

246
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:08,310
So is it "Shawna" and the girls
at the lake house this weekend?

247
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,770
- "Shawna"?
- Oh fuck! I--

248
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:15,110
No. Now there is one thing
that every girl in the whole world

249
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,070
whose name is Shanna
has in common with each other

250
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,450
we all hate the name Shawna

251
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:21,870
and we really hate it
when people call us Shawna.

252
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:03,330
Just remember it's Shanna Banana
not Shawna Banawna.

253
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:06,460
Okay but at some point in the evening
l had fuckability stock.

254
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,080
Yeah. l mean...

255
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,750
it wasn't bullish but...

256
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:39,200
Okay Warren's sending over shots.

257
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,820
And you know the house rule:

258
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:43,330
If he sends over shots
you've gotta do them.

259
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,870
- What?
- Hey them's the rules baby.

260
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,660
Warren says it we do it!

261
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:51,920
l love that philosophy:
"Warren says it we do it."

262
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,130
- So let's do it!
- What is it?

263
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,130
Hey shot first questions later.

264
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,970
Here we go! Post time!

265
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,470
Mmm!

266
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:06,140
Whoo-hoo!

267
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,680
Ow!

268
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:12,900
Now is that a tasty beverage
or is that a tasty beverage?

269
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,360
What the fuck is it?

270
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,400
Chartreuse the only liquor so good
they named a color after it.

271
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,950
Who's down for dos Chartreuse?

272
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,200
Not me.

273
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,370
- l'm going out for a smoke.
- Okay.

274
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:29,790
But careful where you keep
that hot flame all right?

275
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,500
You'll blow up the joint.

276
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,890
Drinks. What can I get you?
Shanna Banana?

277
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:49,560
Another big-ass
Long Island iced tea.

278
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,600
Bombay Sapphire
and tonic no ice.

279
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:55,190
Good boy.

280
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:58,070
Oh.

281
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,710
Oh hey Punky uh one of the lights
is off in the parking lot. Flip it.

282
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,210
- Oh Jesus Christ!
- Whoa!

283
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:59,090
You scared the fuck
out of me you shitty asshole!

284
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:01,840
l swear Arlene
I was not trying to scare you.

285
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,590
I just got lucky.

286
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,470
Oh hardy-fucking-har.
Go inside.

287
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,260
- Wait a minute.
- Why?

288
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,890
- l was thinking we could make out.
- What on a porch?

289
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,770
Not even in the bar
but in front of the entrance?

290
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,100
- Forget it.
- No in my car.

291
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,560
What out there?
It's wet as fucking 'Nam out there.

292
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,860
Not in my car it's not.

293
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,820
Look you won't get wet.

294
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,030
I promise you.

295
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,530
You know most guys
wouldn't brag about that.

296
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,120
Ha-ha-ha.
You know what l mean.

297
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,830
Look l know you guys are going
to Lake LBJ and we can't come.

298
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,460
I wanna make out!

299
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,750
Okay just stop with the whining.
lt's not attractive.

300
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,010
Okay but I don't want it
super-fucking obvious

301
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,970
to everybody
in the bar l've been gone

302
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:53,850
so we'll go in your car we'll make out
for six minutes and that's it.

303
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:54,930
- Deal?
- Great.

304
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,440
No no no. Deal or no deal?

305
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,850
If you're gonna whine
when l pull the plug in six minutes

306
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,980
we can just walk back inside
the fucking bar right now.

307
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,610
- Deal. No whining.
- And no begging.

308
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:05,110
And no begging.
When you say done it's done.

309
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,320
I'm gonna remember
you said that.

310
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,950
Okay let's go.

311
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,160
Oh you got two jobs:

312
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,040
kiss good and make sure
my hair don't get wet.

313
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:50,110
Now look you can't look like
you're trying to get her out of here

314
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,570
before Christian Simonson shows up

315
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:54,370
but you've got to get her out of here
before Christian Simonson shows up.

316
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,450
But what's the point?

317
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,580
They're going to Shanna's
daddy's house at Lake LBJ

318
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:00,210
and it's no guys--
absolutely no guys.

319
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:03,090
Okay so after we bring
the girls drinks

320
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:07,670
in fairly rapid order but not obvious
we order two more rounds of shots.

321
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,220
You think they're gonna fall for that?

322
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,100
We'll be very convincing.

323
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,470
Now it's time to turn up the volume.
No more fucking around.

324
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,930
We go to Jäger shots.

325
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,390
Man they're not gonna
drink Jäger shots.

326
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,020
Dude as long as a guy's buying the booze
a fucking bitch'll drink anything.

327
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,770
Come on dude we can at least
get one shot of Jäger

328
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,400
down these fucking bitches' throats.

329
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,440
After that we'll see if they got
another Jäger shot in them.

330
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,530
You never know.

331
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,160
That could be the shot that puts
them past the point of "fuck it."

332
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,030
Then all of a sudden
"no guys at the lake house"

333
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,740
turns into "a couple of guys
at the lake house."

334
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,250
My point exactly.

335
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,620
l know l can at least get
Shanna "Suck My" Banana

336
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,000
to do a fucking Buttery Nipple shot.

337
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,250
What's Julia's sweet shot?

338
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,880
- Key lime pie.
- Oh come on.

339
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,800
Even fucking Leroy Brown'd
do one more for dessert.

340
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,800
Dude check it out.

341
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,760
I wonder if B.J.
brought the Bear with him.

342
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,180
Jesus!

343
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:06,690
Dude fucking cut himself
falling out of his time machine.

344
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:10,030
Could l get a chicken suit
for Stroker Ace please?

345
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,190
And where did you two
disappear to?

346
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,940
I had to get something out of the car
and Nate was gentlemanly enough

347
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,690
to escort me with his umbrella.

348
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:51,150
Ah good for you Nate.

349
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:53,240
You see that pretty girl
sitting by herself at the bar?

350
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:57,570
Who the dirty hippie?

351
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,490
Meow. She's not a hippie.

352
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,330
She might as well be a hippie.

353
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:04,920
Thank you Timmy boy.

354
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,670
Well do you know
what just happened to her?

355
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:11,420
No. But I know she's a skinny
fake-blonde bitch.

356
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,010
Oh l'm sorry.
You were telling a story.

357
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,680
What about her?

358
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:23,730
Hey Warren is there anybody in this place
you could vouch for to give me a ride home?

359
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:28,860
Fair lady your chariot awaits.

360
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,520
You've been eavesdropping?

361
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:33,610
Oh eavesdropping
and can't help but hear.

362
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:36,700
l think l belong
in the latter category.

363
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,620
So uh Icy Hot

364
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,030
are you offering me a ride home?

365
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,620
l'm offering you a lift if
when l'm ready to leave you are too.

366
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,210
And when are you thinking
about leaving?

367
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:49,540
Truthfully I'm not thinking about it.

368
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:53,550
But when l do
you will be the first to know.

369
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:55,380
Will you be able to uh drive later?

370
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,640
I know looks can be deceiving

371
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,390
but I'm a teetotaler.

372
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,850
I've been drinking club soda
and lime all night

373
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,720
and now l'm building up
to my big drink.

374
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,350
Which is what?

375
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:09,060
Virgin piña colada.

376
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:12,900
Okay. Why would someone
who doesn't drink

377
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,190
spend hours at a bar
drinking water?

378
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,410
A bar offers all kind of things
other than alcohol.

379
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:22,240
Mmm. Really?

380
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,040
Like what?

381
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,170
Women nacho grande platters

382
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,880
the fellowship of some
fascinating individuals

383
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,090
like Warren here.

384
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:37,800
Alcohol is just a lubricant
for all the individual encounters

385
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,590
that a barroom offers.

386
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,930
Ooh. Is that cowboy wisdom?

387
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:45,220
I'm not a cowboy Pam.

388
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,060
I'm a stuntman.

389
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:51,020
But that's a very easy mistake to make.

390
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,360
How do you know my name?

391
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,320
When you were talking with Warren

392
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,360
couldn't help but overhear.

393
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:02,200
Fair enough.
So what's your name Icy?

394
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,870
Stuntman Mike.

395
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,540
Stuntman Mike's your name?

396
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,630
You ask anybody.

397
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:14,630
Hey Warren who is this guy?

398
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,380
Stuntman Mike.

399
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,670
- And who the hell is Stuntman Mike?
- He's a stuntman.

400
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,640
Warren six shots of Wild Turkey!

401
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,190
Yeah!

402
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:41,030
Yeah.

403
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:45,280
Salud.

404
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:47,120
Down the snatch.

405
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,670
You know Pam
I think it's time for my big drink.

406
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,500
Well Stuntman Mike

407
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:57,500
since I have a tab here
can l buy you that virgin piña colada?

408
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,840
Thank you Pam.
That would be lovely.

409
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:04,510
Warren a uh virgin piña colada
for my stuntman friend

410
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:07,260
and I'll have another
Cadillac Cabo Wabo margarita.

411
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:10,020
Cabo Wabo virgin.

412
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:13,330
Hi honey. Lanna Frank.

413
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:15,420
- Mwah! Hey baby.
- How are you?

414
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,790
Hey.

415
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,510
Hey. What's shaking bacon?

416
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,760
Hey!

417
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,350
It's about fucking time!

418
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:34,100
Well beggars can't be choosers.

419
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:37,150
Take a picture.
It lasts longer.

420
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,860
What?

421
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,860
That table. Seems to keep
um getting your attention.

422
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,820
ls that the girl
from the billboard outside?

423
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:48,780
- Yep.
- She sure is a striking-looking woman.

424
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,780
It's got gin tequila--

425
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:53,290
- Look at that hair.
- Lots of leave-in conditioner.

426
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:58,370
- ls that jealousy l detect?
- Hardly.

427
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:02,420
But if you wanna get with uh Jungle Julia
there's a real easy way to do that.

428
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,630
- Really?
- Yeah.

429
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:05,840
- What would that be?
- Get famous.

430
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,090
You won't have to find her.
She'll find you.

431
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:11,470
And you don't even wanna know
what she did for that billboard.

432
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:14,470
Enjoy it cocksucker.
You've earned it.

433
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,480
What did she ever do to you?

434
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,020
We went to school together
from kindergarten through high school.

435
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,270
That's what she did to me.

436
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,110
She was her height right now at 12.

437
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,820
She was a monster.

438
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,820
Half the guys she still fucks
from the old class

439
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,860
she used to beat up and terrorize
in the fifth grade.

440
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:32,580
l see. And she used to beat you up
and take your chocolate milk huh?

441
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,290
That pituitary case?

442
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:35,830
Might've kicked my ass
a couple of times.

443
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:38,870
Sorry. l'm built like a girl
not a black man.

444
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,590
But I'd die before I ever gave
Julia Lucai my chocolate milk.

445
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,950
Hey are you famous or something?

446
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,500
Or something.

447
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,000
No no no. Really.

448
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,670
Hey what do you do?

449
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,300
Really?

450
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,970
What I do is work my ass off
to get my own record label off the ground.

451
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:32,930
But why that girl
wanted a picture of me

452
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:35,010
is because l'm a local deejay.

453
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,600
Wait a minute.

454
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,270
You got a billboard
by Big Kahuna Burger don't you?

455
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:47,280
Yeah. l got one there
too Zatoichi.

456
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,410
Yeah.

457
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,740
Jungle Julia Lucai.

458
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,740
Stuntman Mike McKay.

459
00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:01,370
Well good to meet you
Stuntman Mike.

460
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,710
Now my friends and l are gonna
continue to get our weed on.

461
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:06,500
- Would you care for some?
- Thank you Julia.

462
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:09,710
But just the same no thanks.

463
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,800
- Suit yourself.
- But you know--

464
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,020
Aw shit. Oh God.

465
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,270
Sorry. lt's nothing.

466
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,280
What the fuck was that?

467
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,740
Actually l do want you
to have a shot.

468
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,790
You got some voucher here.

469
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,450
I asked him what movies
you worked on.

470
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,330
No fucking clue.

471
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:46,750
Well technically l really don't know
if he's ever done anything for sure.

472
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:49,420
I mean he shows me</i>
an episode of High Chaparall</i>

473
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,170
a guy falls off a horse
he says it's him.

474
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:56,180
You know the show The Virginian?

475
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,770
Yeah well there was another actor
on that show-- Gary Clarke--

476
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,680
and I looked like him a bit.

477
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:05,810
Obviously
before I cut myself shaving.

478
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,650
Oh I like it.

479
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:12,150
Well damn if you ain't so sweet
you make sugar taste just like salt.

480
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,990
Anyway I did a lot of Virginians</i>
doubling Gary Clarke.</i>

481
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:19,530
And uh then that show</i>
turned into The Men of Shiloh</i>

482
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,290
they brought on Lee Majors
and l doubled him.

483
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:25,540
From that point on
I specialized mostly in car stunts.

484
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:29,460
Yeah I did damn near</i>
the whole third season of Vegas.</i>

485
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,710
I was Robert Urich's driving double.

486
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,760
And then Bob did another show-- Gavilan</i>

487
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,430
and he brought me with him on that till...

488
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:41,600
And after that...

489
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,560
Do you know any of these shows
or people I'm talking about?

490
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,270
Sorry.

491
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,820
- No.
- No.

492
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:58,700
So how exactly does one
become a stuntman

493
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,780
Stuntman Mike?

494
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:03,120
Well in Hollywood

495
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,040
anybody fool enough
to throw himself down a flight of stairs

496
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,040
can usually find somebody
to pay him for it.

497
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,880
But really l got into the business

498
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,590
the way most people
get in the stunt business.

499
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:15,420
- How's that?
- My brother got me in it.

500
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,840
- Well who's your brother?
- Stuntman Bob.

501
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,520
l'm trying to get these two shows
happening in New York for November.

502
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,070
- l'm ready to blaze.
- Finally. Yeah.

503
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:36,820
- You need to catch up with us.
- Now the party can start.

504
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,900
Yep.

505
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:40,240
Anyhoo l'm sorry.

506
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,870
Will you forgive me?

507
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:47,080
But you have to be real nice to me
for the whole rest of the time l'm here.

508
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,120
- Promise. You ready to go to the lake?
- Mm-hmm.

509
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:51,880
How about your little friend?
You wanna bring him?

510
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,630
I thought no boys.

511
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,670
If you really want him to come
Shanna won't mind.

512
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,340
So how about it?
Boys or just us girls?

513
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,090
Us girls.

514
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,930
Good idea.

515
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,680
Ladies.

516
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:08,560
Thanks.

517
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,600
Cheers Butterfly.

518
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:17,150
"The woods are lovely dark and deep

519
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:22,620
"and l have promises to keep
and miles to go before I sleep.

520
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,830
"Did you hear me Butterfly?

521
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:30,120
Miles to go before you sleep."

522
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:33,000
Sorry Stuntman Burt--

523
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,340
Mike.

524
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:37,800
Mike. She already
broke off that dance.

525
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,840
Is that true?

526
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,640
Did l miss my chance?

527
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:48,390
Do I frighten you?

528
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,690
Is it my scar?

529
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:58,650
It's your car.

530
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:00,950
Ah. Yeah l know.

531
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,780
Sorry.

532
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,870
It's my mom's car.

533
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,580
Have you been following us?

534
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,830
No. But that's what
I love about Austin.

535
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:14,000
It's just so damn small.

536
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,380
- You've seen this guy before?
- l saw him outside of Guero's.

537
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,340
And l saw you outside Guero's too.

538
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:23,180
You saw my car l saw your legs.

539
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:26,600
Now look l ain't stalking y'all
but I didn't say I wasn't a wolf.

540
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,680
So you really weren't following us?

541
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,020
I'm not following you Butterfly.

542
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,270
I just got lucky.

543
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:39,110
So how about that lap dance?

544
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,030
Sorry. lt was a one-time-only offer

545
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:44,490
and she did it earlier
this evening at Anton's.

546
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:46,870
- No she didn't.
- How do you know?

547
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:49,700
I'm good that way.

548
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,580
And you look a little touchéd.

549
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,040
- What's "touchéd"?
- Wounded slightly.

550
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,920
Why should I be wounded?

551
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,420
Because you expected guys
to be pestering you all night

552
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:02,380
but from your look
I can tell nobody pestered you at all.

553
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,930
That kind of hurt your feelings
a little bit didn't it?

554
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,890
There are few things
as fetching as a bruised ego

555
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,930
on a beautiful angel.

556
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:18,270
So...

557
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:23,070
how about that lap dance?

558
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:25,660
I think l'm gonna have to
give you a rain check.

559
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:30,790
Well since you'll be leaving
in the next couple of days

560
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:34,660
that rain check will be worthless.

561
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:37,750
But that's okay.

562
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:40,420
I understand
if I make you uncomfortable.

563
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,260
You're still a nice girl

564
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:46,130
and I still like you.

565
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:49,680
But I must warn you of something.

566
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,760
You know how people say...

567
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:53,980
"You're okay in my book"

568
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:57,350
or "ln my book that's no good"?

569
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,690
Well l actually have a book.

570
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,650
And everybody l ever meet

571
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,030
goes in this book.

572
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:11,080
And now l've met you
and you're going in the book.

573
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:18,290
Except l'm afraid I must file you...

574
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:22,460
under "chickenshit."

575
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,550
And what if l did it?

576
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:29,300
Well l definitely couldn't file you
under "chickenshit" then now could l?

577
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,890
What's your name again?

578
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:32,970
Stuntman Mike.

579
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:36,810
Well Stuntman Mike l'm Butterfly.

580
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:41,690
My friend Jungle Julia over here says
that jukebox inside is pretty impressive.

581
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:44,150
- Yeah it is.
- Yeah.

582
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:48,200
Why don't you go get ready
for your lap dance?

583
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:05,300
What about "kind of cute kind of hot
kind of sexy hysterically funny

584
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,880
but not funny-looking guy
who you could fuck"

585
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,340
did you not understand?

586
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:03,020
I'm driving.

587
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,270
We're gonna go somewhere else.
We're gonna go hang out.

588
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:07,350
- You ready to go?
- Yeah.

589
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,860
- Bye.
- Bye.

590
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:14,530
I think you got Mike laid tonight.

591
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,280
Lookin' good Cannonball Run!

592
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,580
He's just giving me a ride.

593
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:25,080
- Oh no doubt.
- Have a nice ride!

594
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,870
Look double fucks...

595
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:34,630
uh-uh I am not gonna fuck him.

596
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:37,550
l can hear you.

597
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:41,550
- He's old enough to be my dad--
- I can still hear you.

598
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:47,560
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

599
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,980
Wow that's fucking scary.

600
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:56,740
Yeah well
I wanted it to be impressive.

601
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:00,700
Scary tends to impress.

602
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,580
Is it safe?

603
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:05,580
Oh it's better than safe.
lt's death proof.

604
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:08,250
How do you make a car death proof?

605
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:10,120
Well that's what stuntmen do.

606
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:12,710
You've seen a movie
where a car gets into some smash-up

607
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:15,710
there ain't no way in hell
anybody's walking away from?

608
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,880
Yeah.

609
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,720
Well how do you think they accomplish that?

610
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,430
CGI?

611
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:25,760
Well unfortunately Pam nowadays
more often than not you're right.

612
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:28,770
But back in the all-or-nothing days</i>
the Vanishing Point days</i>

613
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:31,020
the Dirty Mary Crazy Larry days</i>

614
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,940
the White Line Fever days--</i>

615
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,730
real cars
smashing into real cars

616
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:38,610
with real dumb people
driving them.

617
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:41,820
So you give the stunt team
the car you want to smash up

618
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:44,120
take her and reinforce
that fucker everywhere

619
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:49,540
and voilà you got yourself
a death-proof automobile.

620
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:51,620
That makes sense.

621
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:54,000
I just didn't know you could
make a car death proof.

622
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,000
Hell I can drive this baby
into a brick wall

623
00:43:56,090 --> 00:44:00,220
doing 125 miles an hour
just for the experience.

624
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:09,180
Why is your passenger seat in a box?

625
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:10,980
Well this is a movie car.

626
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:14,100
Sometimes when you're shooting a crash
director wants to put a camera in the car.

627
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:16,730
You know shoot the crash
from the inside.

628
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,650
That's where you put the camera.
They call it a crash box. Here.

629
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,990
There you go.

630
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:26,660
You know when you asked
to drive me home

631
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,660
you didn't mention your car
didn't have a passenger seat.

632
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:31,660
Yeah well actually
I didn't ask to drive you home.

633
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:35,040
You asked me for a ride and l said yes.
But look at the bright side Pam.

634
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:38,170
I won't be getting fresh
putting my hand on your knee.

635
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:42,800
That is the bright side.

636
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,510
I thought so.

637
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,450
Well Pam which way you going?

638
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,370
- Left or right?
- Right.

639
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,960
Ah that's too bad.

640
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,290
Why?

641
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:22,050
Well because there was a 50-50 shot
on whether you'd be going left or right.

642
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:24,220
You see we're both going left.

643
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,510
You could've just as easily
been going left too

644
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:27,720
and if that was the case

645
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,260
it would've been a while
before you started getting scared.

646
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:32,810
But since you're going the other way

647
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:34,770
I'm afraid...

648
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:39,060
you're gonna have to start
getting scared...immediately.

649
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:41,280
What the fuck?

650
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,740
Cocksucking motherfucker!

651
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:53,580
Just fucking let me out of here!

652
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:54,910
I'll fucking rip your fucking--

653
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,330
Stop the fucking car!

654
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:41,670
Okay here's the thing.

655
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:43,960
l get it.

656
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:47,470
I-- l know it's a joke
and it's super-funny.

657
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:51,600
Um but if you just stop right now

658
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,970
you know and-- and-- and let me out

659
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:57,180
l'll never tell anybody
because l know it's a joke.

660
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:59,190
I know all about jokes.

661
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:03,440
I promise everything will be fine.

662
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,190
Just-- Just-- Just let me out

663
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,400
please and-- and--

664
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:10,320
Hey Pam

665
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:13,660
remember when I said
this car was death proof?

666
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:17,000
Well that wasn't a lie.

667
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:20,170
This car is 100% death proof.

668
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:23,460
Only to get the benefit of it honey

669
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,920
you really need to be
sitting in my seat.

670
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:08,170
Now I gotta catch me
my other girlfriends.

671
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:23,190
No no no no.

672
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:27,230
lt's Dave Dee Dozy
Beaky Mitch and Tich.

673
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,240
So you got it?
Thanks honey.

674
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,910
You're gonna play it next song right?

675
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:35,410
Good boy.

676
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:38,120
Growl.

677
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,250
Bye-bye.

678
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:41,910
Who do you wanna hear?

679
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,670
Dave Dee Dozy Beaky Mitch and Tich.

680
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:45,000
Who?

681
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:48,130
Dave Dee Dozy Beaky Mitch and Tich.

682
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:49,920
Who the fuck are they?

683
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:53,970
For your information Pete Townshend
at one point almost quit The Who

684
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:56,470
and if he had
he would've ended up in this group

685
00:48:56,550 --> 00:49:00,430
thus making it Dave Dee Dozy
Beaky Mitch Tich and Pete.

686
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,850
And if you ask me he should have.

687
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:06,230
That's my boy!

688
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:56,590
l wanna hear
this part of the song louder!

689
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:46,390
Do you remember anything?

690
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,600
Uh l don't remember.

691
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,480
Dr. Block.

692
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:04,450
<i>Self restraints to room 310.</i>

693
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:07,120
<i>Self restraints to room 310.</i>

694
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:13,420
Well what's the patient's
prognosis Dr. Block?

695
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,790
I don't really see
it's any of your business.

696
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,880
Come on now sis.

697
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,970
You just tell us.

698
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:22,050
How bad is he?

699
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:27,970
He got banged up real good.

700
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:30,180
Busted nose broken collarbone

701
00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:32,310
smashed up his left index finger.

702
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:34,230
Is that it?

703
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,110
He was real lucky.

704
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:40,990
That'll be all?

705
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:45,030
Why that's more than enough
and I wanna thank you Dr. Block.

706
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,040
Son of a bitch!

707
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:54,500
So Pop what do you think?

708
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:56,880
Well son number one

709
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,000
what I think is so goddamn ghoulish

710
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:01,420
I hesitate to speak it out loud.

711
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:03,840
Well give it a shot.

712
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:07,180
Well what we have here
is a case of vehicular homicide.

713
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:10,020
That old boy in there
murdered them pretty little gals.

714
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:13,890
I mean he used a car and not a hatchet
but they dead just the same.

715
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,270
Well what are you gonna do?

716
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,360
Not a goddamn thing.

717
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:23,110
The DA says ain't no crime here.

718
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,990
Every one of them gals
was swimming in alcohol

719
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:28,200
and floating on weed.

720
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,580
And old Hooper in there

721
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,580
came out clean as a whistle.

722
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:36,580
Now you actually think that he
premeditatedly murdered them gals?

723
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:38,500
Well l can't prove it

724
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:42,010
but since thinking don't cost nothing
l can think it and l do.

725
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:45,380
Yeah but Pop he got
pretty banged up hisself.

726
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:47,720
Well hell yeah he got banged up
but God damn!

727
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,720
Them pretty little gals
look like a goddamn giant

728
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,350
chewed 'em up and spit 'em out.

729
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:53,890
Any of 'em survive?

730
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,600
Shit.

731
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:58,230
Two tons of metal
200 miles an hour

732
00:53:58,310 --> 00:54:01,070
flesh and bone
and plain old Newton...

733
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:03,610
They all princess died.

734
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:11,450
Why?

735
00:54:11,530 --> 00:54:16,330
Well l'd guestimate
it's a sex thing.

736
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:18,080
The only way l can figure it.

737
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:20,250
High-velocity impact

738
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:23,260
twisted metal busted glass

739
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:27,090
all four souls taken
exactly at the same time.

740
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:32,470
Probably the only way that
diabolical degenerate can shoot his goo.

741
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,270
Yeah l think the only thing
we can dream of getting that bastard on

742
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:38,770
is vehicular manslaughter
for the hitchhiker in the death box.

743
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:41,770
That was just plain old goddamn
reckless endangerment.

744
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:45,490
But I got me a goddamn bartender
gonna testify

745
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:48,990
that old Stuntman Mike
didn't drink a drop all night

746
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:52,120
and his passenger
was left stranded by her date

747
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:56,120
in the goddamn rain no less
and she asked him for the fucking ride.

748
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:00,000
Now on paper it's gonna look like
he's just trying to help her out.

749
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:02,420
I mean that's the way
the jury's gonna see it.

750
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,500
So what are you gonna do Pop?

751
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:09,050
Well l can take it upon myself
to work the case you know

752
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:10,590
in my off hours.

753
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,850
Search for evidence
you know to prove my theory.

754
00:55:13,930 --> 00:55:17,480
Alert authorities.
Dog that rotten son of a bitch.

755
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:18,850
Wherever he goes l go.

756
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:21,650
Or l can spend

757
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:24,320
the same goddamn amount
of time and energy

758
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,150
following the NASCAR circuit.

759
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,400
Hmm. I thought about it a lot.

760
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:33,120
I think l'd have a hell of lot
happier life if l did the latter.

761
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:38,410
And just because I can't punish old...
Frankenstein in there for what he's done

762
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:41,460
I'm gonna tell you
like the Lord told John.

763
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:43,420
If he ever does it again

764
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:46,840
I can make goddamn sure
he don't do it in Texas.

765
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,800
- So are you on the same floor with him?
- No he's on the 4th and l'm on the 7th.

766
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:18,220
- Who's in whose room?
- He's in mine.

767
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,640
- And so what happened then?
- That was pretty much it.

768
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,940
We made out in the hall for about 10 minutes
and then l sent him off to his room.

769
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:27,860
- So how's The Rock as a kisser?
- Mmm he's damn good!

770
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:30,440
He's got them mushy lips
and fingertips.

771
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,280
Mmm l love them mushy lips.

772
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,450
And he's a big guy

773
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:35,530
so he spins me around
so my back's up against him.

774
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:38,280
Then he takes his big hand
and he puts it on my throat

775
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:40,700
tilts my head back
and leans over me

776
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,910
kisses me from behind.

777
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,250
- Damn that sounds sexy!
- Mmm it was sexy.

778
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:48,170
But then that was it?
You sent him off?

779
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:49,920
How'd he take it?

780
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,630
Wait a minute.
What are we doing here?

781
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:53,720
lf I'm gonna power through
and pick up Zoë at the airport

782
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,470
I need a big-ass cup of coffee.

783
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:56,550
Since you're getting that

784
00:57:56,630 --> 00:57:59,300
can you get some more vodka
and some more sugar-free Red Bull?

785
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:02,970
We didn't know you were awake.

786
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:05,060
I'm not awake. l'm asleep.

787
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:08,230
But get some more vodka
and some more sugar-free Red Bull anyway.

788
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:10,150
And some Red Apple Tans.

789
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:13,490
Damn! I didn't stop
to get you bitches groceries!

790
00:58:14,610 --> 00:58:17,280
- You remember how
to get to the airport don't you?
- Uh-huh.

791
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,820
Well then you should
get behind the wheel

792
00:58:18,910 --> 00:58:20,700
'cause you gonna drive.

793
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,660
Motherfuckers!

794
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,350
They ain't got sugar-free Red Bull.

795
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:45,560
They got regular Red Bull
and sugar-free G.O. juice.

796
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:48,140
- G.O.
- G.O.!

797
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:33,120
Where the hell are my keys?
Oh here they are.

798
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:35,960
Oh sorry. l didn't mean
to give you a concert there.

799
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:38,840
No it wasn't you.

800
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:41,920
That guy bumped into my feet
when he walked by.

801
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:45,640
l don't know why
but that kind of creeped me out.

802
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:12,870
Little dick.

803
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,420
Clearly.

804
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,630
Since l'm up

805
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:23,130
I might as well hit the ATM.

806
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:26,340
Get me a fucking smoke.

807
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:52,100
What?

808
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:54,270
Did you just see the--

809
01:02:54,350 --> 01:02:55,890
What?

810
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:59,100
Nothing honey.

811
01:03:22,130 --> 01:03:23,170
Yello.

812
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:24,630
It's me.

813
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:26,260
Miss me?

814
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:30,050
Oh you best get your ass
off Kim's car.

815
01:03:30,130 --> 01:03:31,840
I've seen Kim sit on it before.

816
01:03:31,930 --> 01:03:33,890
Her ass ain't your ass.

817
01:03:33,970 --> 01:03:35,560
Okay.

818
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:38,390
So I think I'm in</i>
this month's issue of Allure.</i>

819
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:43,480
You got Allure?</i>

820
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:45,480
Magazines by the window.

821
01:03:59,910 --> 01:04:02,330
Here you are!

822
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,590
You hot mama you.

823
01:04:06,670 --> 01:04:08,090
See you in a second.

824
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,300
3.85. Out of 20.

825
01:04:15,470 --> 01:04:17,350
And you get 15 and change back.

826
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:19,180
Thank you very much.

827
01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:23,980
You know l got other fashion magazines
for sale behind the counter.

828
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,990
No that's okay.
This'll be all.

829
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:30,860
- Thought l'd ask.
- Thanks anyway.

830
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:32,570
Have a good one.

831
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:38,450
l got this month's issue</i>
of Italian Vogue.</i>

832
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:46,090
This month's?

833
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:48,880
Listen to this.

834
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:52,970
The Circle A clerk has</i>
this month's issue of Italian Vogue.</i>

835
01:04:53,050 --> 01:04:54,470
- No way.
- Way.

836
01:04:54,550 --> 01:04:57,050
l can't believe a fucking Circle A</i>
carries Italian Vogue.</i>

837
01:04:57,140 --> 01:04:59,810
It doesn't.
It's his own personal copy.

838
01:04:59,890 --> 01:05:01,890
He'll let it go for 27 bucks.

839
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:03,810
Twenty-seven bucks?

840
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:06,270
What the fuck do you care?
We're talking about fucking per diem here.

841
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:09,280
Look we found an issue of Italian Vogue</i>
in Lebanon Tennessee.</i>

842
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,360
We're lucky he's not asking
for fucking Krugerrands.

843
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,490
I'm getting it
and we're splitting it three ways.

844
01:05:13,570 --> 01:05:14,740
What me you and Kim?

845
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:16,410
No Kim doesn't give a shit</i>
about Italian Vogue.</i>

846
01:05:16,490 --> 01:05:20,450
But Brandy will come in with us
and if she won't Tysla her sister will.

847
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:24,420
Okay. But if anybody
tears out any sheets l want

848
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:25,960
you gotta make color Xerox
of those pages.

849
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:27,920
And l'm not talking fucking Kinko's
here either okay?

850
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,800
You take it to the art department
you have them do it fucking right.

851
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:53,610
You guys are good.

852
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:56,280
Oh my God.

853
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:27,730
That's it. That's it.</i>

854
01:06:27,810 --> 01:06:30,860
Oh boy.</i>

855
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:35,820
Your timing couldn't be better Zoë.

856
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:40,530
It just so happens that we're all three off
duty for the next three days of shooting.

857
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:43,080
Fucking hell.
How does that happen?

858
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:46,000
Well l'm doing Lindsay Lohan's makeup
and she's off for the next three days

859
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:49,170
there's no stunts being filmed
during that time so Kim's free

860
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:53,250
and Lee's on a "will notify"
for the next four days.

861
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:55,170
So how's the shoot going?

862
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:57,050
Great. We're having the best time.

863
01:06:57,130 --> 01:06:59,300
The director Cecil Evans
is so much fun.

864
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:03,010
We're making the coolest movie
and partying all the time.

865
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:06,180
Hell yeah. The next job after this one
is definitely gonna suck.

866
01:07:06,270 --> 01:07:08,230
So let's hear it ladies.

867
01:07:08,310 --> 01:07:10,810
Set romances.
Who's getting it off?

868
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:13,110
That would be Lee and Toolbox.

869
01:07:13,190 --> 01:07:16,400
Oh Toolbox.
Name sounds promising.

870
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:18,610
- He's a grip.
- What he is is a pervert.

871
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:22,240
Well he just keeps sounding
better and better.

872
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,410
What's his perversion?

873
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:28,290
He likes to watch me pee.

874
01:07:28,370 --> 01:07:32,880
Lee is sitting on the toilet
and Toolbox is watching her pee.

875
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,050
P-I-S-S-l-N-G.

876
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,170
Yeah but not no more.

877
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:41,050
Now she's getting it on with The Rock.

878
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,470
- You're having one off with The Rock?
- Not the real Rock.

879
01:07:43,550 --> 01:07:44,890
He's this electrician named Bruce.

880
01:07:44,970 --> 01:07:47,270
And Kim started calling him The Rock
'cause he kind of looks like The Rock

881
01:07:47,350 --> 01:07:49,060
so now we all just call him The Rock.

882
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:50,730
Oh yeah.
This is an all-star crew.

883
01:07:50,810 --> 01:07:52,480
We got a guy who looks like Nick Cage

884
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:54,110
and a guy who looks
like Pee-wee Herman too.

885
01:07:54,190 --> 01:07:56,900
Kim dick department.
Let's hear it.

886
01:07:56,980 --> 01:07:58,610
Mm-mm. No dick this trip.

887
01:07:58,690 --> 01:08:00,650
I got a man.

888
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:03,780
- How long have you had this boyfriend?
- About three months.

889
01:08:03,870 --> 01:08:05,410
Who'd you steal him from?

890
01:08:05,490 --> 01:08:07,620
- Nobody.
- Kim!

891
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:09,080
Wha-- What?

892
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:11,290
He totally had a girlfriend.

893
01:08:11,370 --> 01:08:14,630
All of Kim's boyfriends start out
as somebody else's boyfriend.

894
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:16,670
I did not steal him.

895
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:18,920
I didn't steal any of them.

896
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:21,930
They just...jumped ship.

897
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:26,100
So what's your story Abernathy?

898
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:28,100
Oh Abbie's got the big kahuna.

899
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:31,270
I had a set crush on Cecil.

900
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:34,110
Set crush? Nigga please!
You were his set wife.

901
01:08:34,190 --> 01:08:36,940
"Were" and "had"
being the key words here.

902
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:39,150
Bitch you two are still
into each other and you know it.

903
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,200
Yeah well
if he's so in love with me

904
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:44,990
then whey did he fuck
Daryl Hannah's stand-in?

905
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:47,620
Ho-ho-ho!

906
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:51,540
Yes men are dogs.
Oh it's so funny!

907
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:53,710
Oh it's so funny!

908
01:08:53,790 --> 01:08:55,670
Oh stop acting all hurt.
Your ass just mad.

909
01:08:55,750 --> 01:08:58,130
Yeah he's a stand-in fucker.

910
01:08:58,210 --> 01:09:00,630
Bitch you need to get over that shit.
That was two weeks ago.

911
01:09:00,710 --> 01:09:04,300
Oh well
now that you put it like that.

912
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:06,800
Oh l haven't told you
the best part.

913
01:09:06,890 --> 01:09:10,100
He fucked her on my birthday.

914
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:12,810
Oh that's a horse of a different color.

915
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:14,270
Thank you.

916
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:15,980
Did he know it was your birthday?

917
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:18,980
He's the director.
He's kind of busy.

918
01:09:19,070 --> 01:09:23,200
He ate a piece of my birthday cake
and he got me a present.

919
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:25,320
Yeah l think he knew.

920
01:09:25,410 --> 01:09:28,370
Well what did he get you?

921
01:09:31,950 --> 01:09:33,540
He made me a tape.

922
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:35,250
He made you a tape?

923
01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:36,750
- Yeah.
- Wait.

924
01:09:36,830 --> 01:09:38,840
He didn't burn you a CD .
He made you a tape?

925
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:42,260
- Yeah.
- Oh that is so romantic.

926
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:45,220
Yes. I know what you're gonna say
so don't even go there.

927
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:47,340
That sounds like the test
of true love to me.

928
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:49,760
Look l know you guys like him.

929
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:53,980
He's likable but he fucked
another woman on my birthday.

930
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:55,690
How can you not be on my side?

931
01:09:55,770 --> 01:09:57,770
Well l admit that sounds bad.

932
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,190
It is bad!

933
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:02,190
It just sounds like
there's a little more to it than that.

934
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:04,740
- Were you two fucking?
- Hell no.

935
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:06,780
Hello. Is your name Abernathy?

936
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:08,370
Sorry.

937
01:10:08,450 --> 01:10:12,240
The answer to your question
is no of course not.

938
01:10:12,330 --> 01:10:15,250
What do you mean
"No of course not"?

939
01:10:15,330 --> 01:10:19,500
The reason Cecil hasn't had a girlfriend
in six years is because girls will fuck him.

940
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:22,880
And if you fuck Cecil
you don't become one of his girlfriends.

941
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:26,630
Not to say I want
to be his girlfriend

942
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:29,220
but if l did want to be his girlfriend

943
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:31,850
if l fucked him
I wouldn't be his girlfriend.

944
01:10:31,930 --> 01:10:34,310
I'd be one of his regulars.

945
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:37,390
And l'm just getting
too fucking old for that shit.

946
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:39,900
Have you let him do anything?

947
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:41,400
Yes!

948
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,360
I've let him give me a foot massage

949
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:47,740
and when we go to the movies
I've let him hold my hand.

950
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:50,990
Bitch you might be acting
like you 12 years old

951
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,700
but he just acting like a man.

952
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:54,870
You need to break
that nigga off a piece.

953
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:56,960
Let me get this straight.

954
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:59,040
- You're not fucking him...
- Mm-mm.

955
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,540
- you're not sucking him...
- Mm-mm.

956
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:04,420
you're not giving him any tongue
but Daryl Hannah's stand-in is.

957
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,630
Okay can we just take
my sex life off the table?

958
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:11,260
Actually uh it was Cecil's sex life
that was on the table and your lack of one.

959
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:13,430
Ohhh!

960
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:19,980
Fuck both of you
and your little high five.

961
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:24,730
Before you can claim a nigga
you got to claim a nigga

962
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:27,320
and you can start by giving
that motherfucker a hand job

963
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:28,780
in the back of the van on Tuesday.

964
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:30,490
I'm not gonna do that.

965
01:11:30,570 --> 01:11:33,240
I know you won't.
But you know who will.

966
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:36,290
The bitch that ends up living
in that big-ass mansion of his.

967
01:11:36,370 --> 01:11:40,830
Now I gotta say I haven't entirely agreed
with everything Kim said but it is true:

968
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:43,290
lf you stretch shit out
like you have with Cecil

969
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:45,460
and you suddenly get dirty on them

970
01:11:45,550 --> 01:11:49,130
it blows their mind.

971
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:52,800
So Zoë Kim and l are in the Philippines
at an outdoor rave.

972
01:11:52,890 --> 01:11:56,140
- What were you working on?</i>
- Three Kicks to the Head Part Three.</i>

973
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:59,730
And admittedly
we're a little fucked-up.

974
01:11:59,810 --> 01:12:02,690
- Cheers to that.
- Word.

975
01:12:02,770 --> 01:12:04,190
Cheers.

976
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,570
So Zoë

977
01:12:06,650 --> 01:12:08,490
the genius

978
01:12:08,570 --> 01:12:11,320
wants to take a picture of me.

979
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:14,950
lt's dark as hell
and you can't see shit.

980
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:17,410
So she's got her camera
and keeps saying

981
01:12:17,490 --> 01:12:19,870
"Step back a little" so I do.

982
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:24,340
Then "A little further"
so l step back a little further.

983
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:27,710
Then "A little more" so l do.

984
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:30,670
Then l realize l'm right at the edge

985
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:33,340
of a seven-foot concrete ditch

986
01:12:33,430 --> 01:12:38,350
with God knows how many rocks
and broken bottles and rats in it

987
01:12:38,430 --> 01:12:41,730
and if l fell in that fucking thing
I'd probably would've broken my fucking neck.

988
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:45,730
So l'm yelling at her
"Zoë you almost killed me!"

989
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:51,450
So we laugh about it
and walk a little further

990
01:12:51,530 --> 01:12:54,110
and Zoë starts fucking around

991
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:59,870
and damn if she doesn't fall
in the fucking ditch.

992
01:12:59,950 --> 01:13:02,210
Nice. Nice.

993
01:13:02,290 --> 01:13:05,210
Thank you. Yep. Thank you.

994
01:13:05,290 --> 01:13:08,000
I remember taking a step
and looking down.

995
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:11,220
Just as l'm thinking
"There's that ditch Abbie was talking about"

996
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:13,800
bam l'm in the fucking ditch
you know?

997
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:15,390
What happened?

998
01:13:15,470 --> 01:13:18,810
What with Zoë the cat?
Nothing.

999
01:13:18,890 --> 01:13:20,680
If I fell in that fucking thing

1000
01:13:20,770 --> 01:13:22,770
they would've had to
helicopter me out of there.

1001
01:13:22,850 --> 01:13:25,400
Zoë just lands on her feet.

1002
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:28,900
But then later I started feeling
a little bad about myself.

1003
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:32,780
Zoë falls in the ditch
and it's nothing.

1004
01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:34,610
We're laughing about it.

1005
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:36,820
If I fell in that fucking thing

1006
01:13:36,910 --> 01:13:38,740
I probably would've been
fucking paralyzed.

1007
01:13:38,830 --> 01:13:40,410
Oh honey you can't think like that.

1008
01:13:40,490 --> 01:13:43,040
You know we all have
our individual talents

1009
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:44,790
and that just happens
to be one of Zoë's.

1010
01:13:44,870 --> 01:13:46,630
- Yeah.
- Well...

1011
01:13:46,710 --> 01:13:49,630
physically speaking Zoë is amazing.

1012
01:13:49,710 --> 01:13:53,090
I mean agility reflexes nimbleness.

1013
01:13:53,170 --> 01:13:56,010
There's few human beings
that can fuck with Zoë on that front.

1014
01:13:56,090 --> 01:13:58,300
Oh Kim l like you too.

1015
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,270
Having said that

1016
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:04,060
before you get too envious
of Zoë's prowess

1017
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:06,900
you're missing the most important
part of that story.

1018
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:10,270
You didn't fall in the ditch
Zoë did.

1019
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:14,240
Zoë even knew there was a ditch there
because you told her

1020
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,360
and she still fell in.

1021
01:14:16,450 --> 01:14:19,450
So Lee's right.
We all have our talents.

1022
01:14:19,530 --> 01:14:22,700
Hey l resemble that remark.

1023
01:14:25,870 --> 01:14:28,080
So Kim
you still pack a roscoe?

1024
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:33,300
Check it out bitch.

1025
01:14:33,380 --> 01:14:35,720
- Ooh nice one mate.
- l know this.

1026
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:38,720
- What's a roscoe?
- A roscoe is a pistol.

1027
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,260
- You carry a gun?
- Uh-huh.

1028
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:44,180
- You have a license to carry it?
- Yeah.

1029
01:14:44,270 --> 01:14:47,560
When I became a Secret Service agent
they gave me a license.

1030
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:50,060
Oh l didn't know you were--

1031
01:14:52,150 --> 01:14:55,610
Okay l didn't say it all right?
Stop looking at me. l didn't say it.

1032
01:14:55,690 --> 01:14:57,490
God!

1033
01:14:57,570 --> 01:14:59,490
Did you know Kim carried a gun?

1034
01:14:59,570 --> 01:15:03,580
Yes. Now do l approve? No.

1035
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:05,660
Do I know? Yes.

1036
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:09,540
Look I don't know what
futuristic utopia you live in

1037
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:12,340
but the world I live in
a bitch need a gun.

1038
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:16,260
You can't get around the fact
that people who carry guns

1039
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:18,840
tend to get shot
more than people who don't.

1040
01:15:18,930 --> 01:15:21,180
And you can't get around the fact
that if l go down

1041
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:23,890
to the laundry room in my building
at midnight enough times

1042
01:15:23,970 --> 01:15:25,810
I might get my ass raped.

1043
01:15:25,890 --> 01:15:27,680
Don't do your laundry at midnight.

1044
01:15:27,770 --> 01:15:31,310
Fuck that. l wanna do my laundry
whenever the fuck l wanna do my laundry.

1045
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:34,360
There are other things
you can carry other than a gun.

1046
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:35,900
Pepper spray.

1047
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:40,160
Uh motherfucker try to rape me
I don't wanna give him a skin rash.

1048
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:42,570
I wanna shut that nigga down.

1049
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:46,080
How about a knife at least?

1050
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:49,330
Yeah. You know what happens
to motherfuckers carry knives?

1051
01:15:50,330 --> 01:15:52,380
They get shot!

1052
01:15:52,460 --> 01:15:55,210
Look if l ever become
a famous actress

1053
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:56,760
I won't carry a gun.

1054
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:59,340
I'll hire me a do-dirt nigga
and he'll carry the gun.

1055
01:15:59,420 --> 01:16:01,260
And when shit goes down
l'll sit back and laugh.

1056
01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:04,180
But until that day
it's Wild West motherfucker.

1057
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:07,600
So Zoë you thought about
what you want to do first?

1058
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:12,650
It just so happens
I know exactly what l wanna do.

1059
01:16:12,730 --> 01:16:14,400
Oh really?

1060
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,320
And what would that be?

1061
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:18,570
To me there's no point
in being in America

1062
01:16:18,650 --> 01:16:20,740
unless you can drive
a Detroit muscle car.

1063
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:22,910
And l wanna drive a Dodge Challenger.

1064
01:16:22,990 --> 01:16:26,370
Fuck me swinging balls out.

1065
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:30,910
Um well I guess we can talk to Transpo.

1066
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,290
But does it have to be
a Dodge Challenger?

1067
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:34,590
Not just that.

1068
01:16:34,670 --> 01:16:38,800
It has to be a 1970 Dodge Challenger
with a 440 engine.

1069
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:44,720
How in the fuck
do you expect to do that?

1070
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,600
No worries mate.

1071
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:48,680
I've got it all worked out.

1072
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:51,810
When I knew l was coming here
l went online and found out

1073
01:16:51,890 --> 01:16:55,650
that the local paper here in Tennessee</i>
is the Lebanon News Sentinel.</i>

1074
01:16:55,730 --> 01:16:57,610
- So back home--
- l'm sorry. Where's home?

1075
01:16:57,690 --> 01:16:59,320
Australia right?

1076
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:03,070
What do you mean by that mate?

1077
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:06,450
Zoë's from New Zealand
and you never--

1078
01:17:06,530 --> 01:17:10,200
l repeat never--
call a Kiwi an Aussie.

1079
01:17:10,290 --> 01:17:14,080
That is unless you want
your ass kicked.

1080
01:17:14,170 --> 01:17:16,210
I'm so sorry.
I really am.

1081
01:17:16,290 --> 01:17:19,000
Oh it's okay.

1082
01:17:19,090 --> 01:17:22,340
We're just taking the piss
out of you mate.

1083
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:25,470
Auckland to answer your question.

1084
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:28,350
Anyway l subscribed
to the local paper a month ago.

1085
01:17:28,430 --> 01:17:31,930
Now why the fuck you want a local
redneck newspaper in New Zealand?

1086
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:34,520
Pipe down and I'll tell you.

1087
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:36,480
I've been getting the paper
for the last month

1088
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:39,190
and I've been checking the classified
at the back looking at cars for sale.

1089
01:17:39,270 --> 01:17:41,900
So as of yesterday

1090
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:44,240
for sale in this town

1091
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:47,490
some dude is selling a stock
1970 Dodge Challenger

1092
01:17:47,570 --> 01:17:51,450
with a 440 engine
and a white paint job.

1093
01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:54,210
And you wanna buy it?

1094
01:17:54,290 --> 01:17:58,340
Kim l may be stupid
but I'm not bloody stupid.

1095
01:17:58,420 --> 01:18:02,170
I wanna say I wanna buy it
so he'll let me test-drive it.

1096
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:05,630
A 1970 Dodge Challenger
with a white paint job.

1097
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:08,760
- Oh uh Kowalski.</i>
- Kowalski from Vanishing Point.</i>

1098
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:11,350
- Mate it's a fucking classic!
- Mmm I get it.

1099
01:18:11,430 --> 01:18:13,680
lf l can get this guy
to let me drive it without him

1100
01:18:13,770 --> 01:18:16,310
I will blow the doors off that bitch.

1101
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,270
- What's Vanishing Point?</i>
- Oh God.</i>

1102
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:21,400
"What's Vanishing Point?"</i>

1103
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:24,530
Abs I'm supposed to be
the illiterate one.

1104
01:18:24,610 --> 01:18:27,320
lt's just one of the best
American movies ever made.

1105
01:18:27,410 --> 01:18:31,830
Actually Zoë most girls</i>
wouldn't know Vanishing Point.</i>

1106
01:18:31,910 --> 01:18:34,500
Excuse me. "Most girls"?

1107
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:36,460
What the fuck are you two?

1108
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:39,710
Yeah well we're gearheads.
Of course we watched it.

1109
01:18:39,790 --> 01:18:41,840
Y'all grew up watching</i>
that Pretty in Pink shit.</i>

1110
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:44,550
Oh I like Pretty in Pink.</i>

1111
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:47,130
What so you didn't watch
John Hughes movies?

1112
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:49,220
Of course l did.
l'm a girl.

1113
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:51,350
But l also watched car shit too.

1114
01:18:51,430 --> 01:18:54,020
- Vanishing Point Dirty Mary Crazy Larry...</i>
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</i>

1115
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:55,730
Gone in 60 Seconds--</i>

1116
01:18:55,810 --> 01:18:58,440
The real one
not that Angelina Jolie bullshit.

1117
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:00,730
We have an outdoors theater
in Auckland.

1118
01:19:00,810 --> 01:19:03,400
It plays Vanishing Point</i>
Big Wednesday</i>

1119
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:06,070
all the classics.

1120
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:23,380
What do you horny gals want?

1121
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:30,390
Hey you got a 1970
Dodge Challenger for sale?

1122
01:19:30,470 --> 01:19:32,760
Right up here ladies.

1123
01:19:46,610 --> 01:19:49,530
This shit is off the fucking hook!

1124
01:19:49,610 --> 01:19:53,280
Fucking legendary mate.

1125
01:19:54,370 --> 01:19:57,620
Sweet ass. Well if you'll
excuse me for a moment

1126
01:19:57,700 --> 01:19:59,830
I'd just like to have a word alone
with my business associate.

1127
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,250
- You ladies take your time.
- Okay.

1128
01:20:04,710 --> 01:20:06,210
Mmm.

1129
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:11,050
What are you waiting for?
Ask him to let you drive it by yourself.

1130
01:20:11,130 --> 01:20:13,930
l-- l intend to but first
I need to ask you something.

1131
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:15,260
What?

1132
01:20:15,350 --> 01:20:20,270
If he lets us take it out on our own
I wanna play ship's mast.

1133
01:20:20,350 --> 01:20:22,190
- Oh hell no!
- Would you keep it down?

1134
01:20:22,270 --> 01:20:24,480
- Ain't no way I'm doing ship's mast.
- For Christ sakes--

1135
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,440
- Don't blaspheme.
- Sorry.

1136
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:29,440
Now what did you say
after the last time?

1137
01:20:29,530 --> 01:20:32,660
- Look l know what l said--
- What did you say?

1138
01:20:32,740 --> 01:20:35,830
- l know l said we shouldn't do this again--
- No. You didn't say we shouldn't.

1139
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:37,660
You said we ain't ever
gonna do that again.

1140
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:39,830
- Yeah but--
- "But" my ass!

1141
01:20:39,910 --> 01:20:42,920
You said not only are we never
gonna play ship's mast again

1142
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,880
but you also said if you ever do
what you trying to do now

1143
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:48,420
to not only refuse
but that l had permission

1144
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:51,050
to physically restrain
your ass if necessary.

1145
01:20:51,130 --> 01:20:53,390
Now did you
or did you not say that?

1146
01:20:53,470 --> 01:20:55,180
- Well--
- No no no no.

1147
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:57,060
Answer the question
motherfucker.

1148
01:20:57,140 --> 01:20:58,850
Did you or did you not say that?

1149
01:20:58,930 --> 01:21:01,060
Yes I said that.
However--

1150
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:02,520
Whatever with your "however."

1151
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:06,570
Look l know l said it
and I know I meant it--

1152
01:21:06,650 --> 01:21:07,650
Damn skippy you meant it.

1153
01:21:07,730 --> 01:21:10,610
Yeah but when l said it
I didn't mean in America.

1154
01:21:10,690 --> 01:21:12,700
- Oh nigga please!
- Really--

1155
01:21:12,780 --> 01:21:14,700
I meant we should never play
ship's mast again

1156
01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:16,870
in New Zealand or Australia.

1157
01:21:16,950 --> 01:21:18,950
You are such a liar.

1158
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,710
Look l know what l said
when l said it.

1159
01:21:21,790 --> 01:21:24,210
But when l said it l didn't know
I'd ever come to America.

1160
01:21:24,290 --> 01:21:26,960
And when l said it if l had known
I was going to come to America

1161
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,710
and had the opportunity
to play ship's mast

1162
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,720
with a fucking</i>
Vanishing Point Challenger</i>

1163
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:34,010
I would've added a "however."

1164
01:21:34,090 --> 01:21:35,930
Right?

1165
01:21:40,890 --> 01:21:43,890
Okay oddly enough
I actually understood that.

1166
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:48,190
However just because you
talked yourself into some stupid shit

1167
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:50,480
doesn't mean I have lost
my goddamn mind.

1168
01:21:50,570 --> 01:21:53,360
You need two people
to play ship's mast and I ain't playing.

1169
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:03,120
I'll be your best friend.

1170
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:06,250
l don't need me no best friend
lives on the other side of planet Earth.

1171
01:22:06,330 --> 01:22:09,090
- I'll crack your back.
- You'll crack it anyway.

1172
01:22:09,170 --> 01:22:11,760
Well of course I'll crack it anyway.

1173
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:15,630
But now while l'm here
I'll be your back-cracking slave.

1174
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:18,510
Whenever you want it you got it.
You don't even have to ask for it.

1175
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,430
You just order me to do it.
Just be like...

1176
01:22:20,510 --> 01:22:22,770
"Bitch get over here and get busy."

1177
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:31,360
- You crack my back
you'll give me foot massages...
- Mm-hmm. Mmm.

1178
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:34,690
and after a shower
you put moisturizer on my butt.

1179
01:22:34,780 --> 01:22:37,610
Deal.

1180
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:40,450
So we're gonna see if this guy'll
let us take the car out without him.

1181
01:22:40,530 --> 01:22:43,540
If he does you wait here with Lee
and we'll be back in a moment.

1182
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:45,120
What?

1183
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:48,120
l said we're gonna see if this guy'll
let us take the car out without him--

1184
01:22:48,210 --> 01:22:49,790
I heard what you said.

1185
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:53,170
I just can't believe what you said.

1186
01:22:54,550 --> 01:22:56,170
You know you two got
some fucking balls.

1187
01:22:56,260 --> 01:22:57,680
What?

1188
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:59,510
Don't play dumbass with me.

1189
01:22:59,590 --> 01:23:01,220
I've been up all night.

1190
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:04,600
l'm still a little drunk
and I have a hangover.

1191
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:08,060
l should be in my hotel room asleep
not fucking around here on Tobacco Road.

1192
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:12,020
But because Zoë wanted to drive</i>
some fucking Vanishing Point car I'm here.</i>

1193
01:23:12,110 --> 01:23:15,190
Now you two got the balls
to ask me-- no scratch that--

1194
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:18,320
tell me l gotta go make
conversation with Tom Joad

1195
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:20,370
while the cool kids
get to go out and play?

1196
01:23:20,450 --> 01:23:22,240
Bullshit on that.

1197
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:24,540
- lt ain't like that.
- Then what's it like Kim?

1198
01:23:24,620 --> 01:23:26,250
You guys are our collateral.

1199
01:23:26,330 --> 01:23:28,710
He is never gonna go for it
if we all go.

1200
01:23:28,790 --> 01:23:32,630
I really think one human being
will be collateral enough.

1201
01:23:32,710 --> 01:23:34,840
You're not gonna wanna do
what we're doing.

1202
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:36,460
What drive a car?

1203
01:23:36,550 --> 01:23:38,630
- Mmm.
- We're doing more than that.

1204
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:40,550
What drive it fast?

1205
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:43,430
We're doing more than that.

1206
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:45,850
Actually
we're paying you a compliment

1207
01:23:45,930 --> 01:23:48,060
'cause we gonna do
some stupid shit.

1208
01:23:50,190 --> 01:23:52,480
But that's okay.
We're stunt people.
We ain't got good sense.

1209
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:53,650
But you got good sense

1210
01:23:53,730 --> 01:23:56,360
and anybody with good sense
ain't gonna wanna do what we're doing.

1211
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:58,070
How do you know
I don't wanna do it?

1212
01:23:58,150 --> 01:24:01,570
- 'Cause you're a mom.
- Yeah.

1213
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:07,040
You know we're supposed
to be this big posse

1214
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,540
but that's the excuse you guys use

1215
01:24:08,620 --> 01:24:11,040
whenever you want
to exclude me from something.

1216
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:16,050
So what is it you two daredevils
are doing that I'm just so uncool

1217
01:24:16,130 --> 01:24:18,380
I couldn't possibly understand?

1218
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:21,050
You know
we're kind of conning this guy

1219
01:24:21,130 --> 01:24:24,760
so maybe it's best that we don't go
into detail about it while he's watching us.

1220
01:24:24,850 --> 01:24:29,560
Besides he's probably not
gonna let us do it anyway.

1221
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:36,270
Okay. How about this?

1222
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:37,480
I'll talk him into it.

1223
01:24:37,570 --> 01:24:39,490
But if l talk him into it I go along.

1224
01:24:40,820 --> 01:24:44,070
- How you gonna do that?
- Eh that's my problem.

1225
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:46,120
But don't worry.

1226
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:48,330
He'll say yes.

1227
01:24:48,410 --> 01:24:50,080
What are you gonna do
blow him?

1228
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:53,080
No!

1229
01:24:53,170 --> 01:24:55,670
l'm gonna insinuate
that Lee's gonna blow him.

1230
01:24:59,590 --> 01:25:01,760
That's good.

1231
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:04,010
Not really.

1232
01:25:04,090 --> 01:25:07,310
But let me handle it.
We got a deal?

1233
01:25:11,390 --> 01:25:13,100
Okay Mommy listen up.

1234
01:25:13,190 --> 01:25:15,360
You wanna hang with the cool kids

1235
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:17,110
you got to be cool.

1236
01:25:17,190 --> 01:25:18,690
We take you along
you don't say shit.

1237
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:19,780
You don't even say crap.

1238
01:25:19,860 --> 01:25:21,530
You just sit in the back
and I don't wanna hear

1239
01:25:21,610 --> 01:25:22,860
a peep out of your ass
you understand?

1240
01:25:22,950 --> 01:25:24,320
- Got it.
- l'm serious now.

1241
01:25:24,410 --> 01:25:26,240
You start nagging us
we're pulling over to the side of the road

1242
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:28,280
kicking your ass out
and picking you up later.

1243
01:25:28,370 --> 01:25:30,200
Agreed.

1244
01:25:33,870 --> 01:25:36,790
Okay. Go work your magic.

1245
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:45,140
- Hello sir.
- Hello!

1246
01:25:45,220 --> 01:25:46,640
- Hello. What's your name?
- Jasper.

1247
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:48,350
Hello Jasper.
I'm Abernathy.

1248
01:25:48,430 --> 01:25:50,060
- Aber-- what?
- Abernathy.

1249
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:52,520
- What's your first name?
- That is my first name.

1250
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:54,230
What kind of first name is that?

1251
01:25:54,310 --> 01:25:56,150
You know what?
Just call me Abbie.

1252
01:25:56,230 --> 01:25:58,690
Okay Abbie.

1253
01:25:58,770 --> 01:26:01,480
Jasper we were wondering
if my friends and I

1254
01:26:01,570 --> 01:26:03,740
could take the car out
for a little test-drive out on our own.

1255
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:05,490
You know just to see
if we're comfortable in it.

1256
01:26:05,570 --> 01:26:07,320
Why would l do
something stupid like that?

1257
01:26:07,410 --> 01:26:09,700
To better sell your automobile.

1258
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:12,000
How do I know y'all ain't
just gonna steal it?

1259
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:14,330
Four reasons actually.

1260
01:26:14,410 --> 01:26:16,540
One we're not thieves.

1261
01:26:16,620 --> 01:26:19,340
Two that would be rude.

1262
01:26:19,420 --> 01:26:21,550
Three we're staying
at the Days lnn in town.

1263
01:26:21,630 --> 01:26:23,380
You can call the hotel
check with management.

1264
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:25,130
We're registered
for the next month.

1265
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:27,180
Actually Zoë's not.

1266
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:29,930
But Kim and l are
so we're totally track-downable.

1267
01:26:30,010 --> 01:26:31,720
Who's Kim? The colored girl?

1268
01:26:32,810 --> 01:26:36,190
Yes. Kim would be
the girl of color.

1269
01:26:36,270 --> 01:26:38,900
And reason number four
and the most important

1270
01:26:38,980 --> 01:26:41,650
while we're taking the car out
for a little spin

1271
01:26:41,730 --> 01:26:44,690
that'll give you a better opportunity
to get acquainted

1272
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:48,160
with our other friend Lee.

1273
01:26:51,330 --> 01:26:53,700
Why does she look kind of familiar?

1274
01:26:53,790 --> 01:26:56,660
That would be because
she's a famous actress.

1275
01:26:56,750 --> 01:26:58,750
Oh.

1276
01:26:58,830 --> 01:27:00,210
Why is she dressed like that?

1277
01:27:00,290 --> 01:27:03,420
Well you see we're making
a Hollywood movie in town

1278
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:06,550
and it's a cheerleader movie
and she's one of the cheerleaders.

1279
01:27:06,630 --> 01:27:08,380
What's a cheerleader movie?

1280
01:27:08,470 --> 01:27:11,010
A movie about cheerleaders.

1281
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:12,430
Is it a porno movie?

1282
01:27:13,930 --> 01:27:16,600
Yes it is.

1283
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:19,270
But don't mention it.

1284
01:27:19,350 --> 01:27:21,650
She's shy.

1285
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:27,740
Lee this is Jasper.
Jasper Lee.

1286
01:27:27,820 --> 01:27:29,820
Now you two kids
stay out of trouble.

1287
01:27:29,910 --> 01:27:33,030
Hey good-lookin'
be back to pick you up later.

1288
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,950
Ta-ta!

1289
01:27:44,380 --> 01:27:46,260
Gulp.

1290
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:03,560
You thinking what I'm thinking?

1291
01:28:03,650 --> 01:28:05,280
I think l'm thinking it.

1292
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:06,820
What are you and you thinking?

1293
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:10,240
I'm thinking we told your ass
to shut the fuck up.

1294
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:15,490
- Where y'all going?
- You stay put.

1295
01:28:15,580 --> 01:28:17,540
I gotta take a--

1296
01:28:33,970 --> 01:28:36,930
So you ready to do this?

1297
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:38,430
You sure?

1298
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:41,770
Well l always don't wanna do it
right before I'm gonna do it.

1299
01:28:41,850 --> 01:28:42,850
You know what l mean?

1300
01:28:42,940 --> 01:28:45,360
Yeah l know what you mean
'cause l don't wanna do it.

1301
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:47,570
- Kim...
- l'm just saying.

1302
01:28:47,650 --> 01:28:49,320
Look if you're gonna take
the piss out of it--

1303
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:51,030
I'm just saying.

1304
01:28:52,570 --> 01:28:54,570
You wanna start out on top?

1305
01:28:55,660 --> 01:28:59,500
Practically doesn't count
if you start on the top.

1306
01:29:03,330 --> 01:29:06,380
Here are your gloves.

1307
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:15,640
No no no no.
I'm wearing the jacket.

1308
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:17,430
This is my jacket.

1309
01:29:17,510 --> 01:29:21,890
Um ain't you 'posed to be
my slave or some shit?

1310
01:29:21,980 --> 01:29:25,020
- Come on.
- l'm the one who's on the fucking bonnet!

1311
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:28,070
"Bonnet" my ass.
You on the hood.

1312
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:39,040
Y'all l think I hear a car coming!

1313
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:40,750
Give me your belt.

1314
01:29:40,830 --> 01:29:42,250
Oh.

1315
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:47,880
But this is my cute shit.

1316
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:49,090
- Well--
- Fuck that.

1317
01:29:49,170 --> 01:29:51,630
Get Abernathy's belt.

1318
01:29:51,710 --> 01:29:53,720
Fine. We'll use Abbie's belt.

1319
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:01,100
- Give me your belt.
- No.

1320
01:30:01,180 --> 01:30:03,560
- Prada.
- Come on give her the belt.

1321
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:05,560
Magic word.

1322
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:07,730
Please give her the belt.

1323
01:30:07,810 --> 01:30:10,400
Just 'cause you asked nicely.

1324
01:30:13,150 --> 01:30:16,410
- lt's nice to be nice Kim!
- Whatever.

1325
01:30:16,490 --> 01:30:17,660
You know what?

1326
01:30:17,740 --> 01:30:20,910
Don't even fucking think about asking me
next time you want me to do your hair.

1327
01:30:20,990 --> 01:30:21,990
Your ass gonna do it.

1328
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:23,410
Yeah and you'll ask
"pretty please" bitch

1329
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:25,250
because that's what you do
when no one else is looking.

1330
01:30:25,330 --> 01:30:26,420
You ain't that fucking hard.

1331
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:27,630
I ain't getting that shit.

1332
01:30:27,710 --> 01:30:30,170
Abernathy don't get
on my nerves right now.

1333
01:30:30,250 --> 01:30:31,300
I got shit on my mind.

1334
01:30:31,420 --> 01:30:33,010
Ooh!

1335
01:30:33,090 --> 01:30:35,090
You know l ain't six.

1336
01:30:48,940 --> 01:30:50,770
It's cold. Can we roll up
one of these windows?

1337
01:30:50,860 --> 01:30:53,110
No.

1338
01:30:53,190 --> 01:30:56,700
Okay Abernathy.
Check this out.

1339
01:31:08,370 --> 01:31:10,540
What the fuck are you guys doing?

1340
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:20,850
What does that mean?

1341
01:31:22,470 --> 01:31:24,640
Whoa.

1342
01:31:28,770 --> 01:31:31,480
Faster you black bitch! Faster!

1343
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:41,490
Is that fast enough for your bony ass?

1344
01:31:41,570 --> 01:31:43,620
Whoohoo!

1345
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:46,000
Whoa-ho-ho-ho!

1346
01:31:49,870 --> 01:31:52,420
Abernathy get your ass up here.

1347
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:01,340
All righty.

1348
01:32:01,430 --> 01:32:04,220
Whoa whoa whoa.

1349
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:17,530
Go go go!

1350
01:32:17,610 --> 01:32:20,280
Check it out bitch.
You want it fucking faster?

1351
01:33:35,810 --> 01:33:39,530
- Oh my God.
- What the fuck? Shit!

1352
01:33:42,110 --> 01:33:44,070
Zoë!

1353
01:33:45,780 --> 01:33:47,660
Damn it!

1354
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:56,630
Now.

1355
01:33:57,960 --> 01:33:59,170
Did you do something to him?

1356
01:33:59,250 --> 01:34:01,380
- Did you say something?
- Nothing! Nothing!

1357
01:34:01,460 --> 01:34:02,590
Shit!

1358
01:34:02,670 --> 01:34:03,760
Shit here he comes!
