<seg id="0">  </seg>
<seg id="1"> Wait, wait! </seg>
<seg id="1">  </seg>
<seg id="2"> I have to do a pisciata, the biggest pisciata in the world! </seg>
<seg id="2">  </seg>
<seg id="3"> - So let's go! - Stay calm! </seg>
<seg id="3">  </seg>
<seg id="4"> - Who has the stuff? - No one, if you do not have it. </seg>
<seg id="4">  </seg>
<seg id="5"> - I was hoping to bring you. - Yeah, why do not you have the stuff? Holy Christ, Shanna, it's not my fucking job supplying you all the grass when we leave! </seg>
<seg id="5">  </seg>
<seg id="6"> Brake, sir! </seg>
<seg id="6">  </seg>
<seg id="7"> You get angry a little too fast. I was just teasing you. </seg>
<seg id="7">  </seg>
<seg id="8"> But who gets angry ?! Perhaps it would be nice if you did not mind me all the fucking times and if you were surprised by bringing it to me every now and then! </seg>
<seg id="8">  </seg>
<seg id="9"> Okay, you look bad in a kids movie. - Finish the whims? - I'm not doing the whims. - Yes, on the other hand! </seg>
<seg id="9">  </seg>
<seg id="10"> You're in the car for two seconds and I swear! </seg>
<seg id="10">  </seg>
<seg id="11"> I did not say swearing. Yeah, dear, you said, "Holy Christ, Shanna!" </seg>
<seg id="11">  </seg>
<seg id="12"> And before finishing the sentence you put a "fuck" to emphasize your irritation. - All right, I buy it when we find it. </seg>
<seg id="12">  </seg>
<seg id="13"> One: I'm not the money the problem, but the break of balls to go find the grass, and two: We are not arguing. </seg>
<seg id="13">  </seg>
<seg id="14"> Arlene, have you forgotten that it means going around with Jungle Julia? </seg>
<seg id="14">  </seg>
<seg id="15"> This is not arguing. </seg>
<seg id="15">  </seg>
<seg id="16"> This is Julia who acts as a pesky bitch and I reproach and are indulgent at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="16">  </seg>
<seg id="17"> So what we are after all these years. </seg>
<seg id="17">  </seg>
<seg id="18"> Billboard! </seg>
<seg id="18">  </seg>
<seg id="19"> So, what's the plan, beauty? - Margarita and Mexican food from Guero's. </seg>
<seg id="19">  </seg>
<seg id="20"> - Did you call Rafael to tell him we're coming? - SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="20">  </seg>
<seg id="21"> - How good are you! - I know! </seg>
<seg id="21">  </seg>
<seg id="22"> We hear, tonight will also see Christian Simonson? </seg>
<seg id="22">  </seg>
<seg id="23"> You can bet your ass, he comes with Jesse Letterman. </seg>
<seg id="23">  </seg>
<seg id="24"> Christian Simonson, the director, is in the city! </seg>
<seg id="24">  </seg>
<seg id="25"> - And he has a cake for Julia. "If he had a crush on me, he would call me instead of disappearing for 6 months and would move his ass more often to come here and make a phone call on my birthday. </seg>
<seg id="25">  </seg>
<seg id="26"> Billboard! </seg>
<seg id="26">  </seg>
<seg id="27"> Yeah, but if you try to put your beautiful legs on it, it's done. </seg>
<seg id="27">  </seg>
<seg id="28"> Only when I'm going to sell her home on the hill where I will live, I'll call you to tell you it worked. </seg>
<seg id="28">  </seg>
<seg id="29"> Then, Margarita and Mexican food from Guero's, hear Christian and Jesse, tell him later and make sure they come. </seg>
<seg id="29">  </seg>
<seg id="30"> Others expect us to reach Texas Chili Parlor. </seg>
<seg id="30">  </seg>
<seg id="31"> Fuck! About the others, what did you and Nate do last night? </seg>
<seg id="31">  </seg>
<seg id="32"> What do you want to do? We just met, fuck! </seg>
<seg id="32">  </seg>
<seg id="33"> If you do not slit the balls a while, when they respect you? </seg>
<seg id="33">  </seg>
<seg id="34"> All right, it's clear what you did not do. </seg>
<seg id="34">  </seg>
<seg id="35"> Why do not you enlighten us about what you did? </seg>
<seg id="35">  </seg>
<seg id="36"> Just nothing special. </seg>
<seg id="36">  </seg>
<seg id="37"> We kissed on the couch for 20 minutes. </seg>
<seg id="37">  </seg>
<seg id="38"> Clothes, naked or nude? </seg>
<seg id="38">  </seg>
<seg id="39"> Clothes! We kissed, we did not do "the fact". </seg>
<seg id="39">  </seg>
<seg id="40"> Sorry if I break the balls, but what would be the "fact"? </seg>
<seg id="40">  </seg>
<seg id="41"> - "The fact" would be all the rest. - And you call it "the fact"? </seg>
<seg id="41">  </seg>
<seg id="42"> - I call it "the fact". - Do you guys like that call it "the fact"? </seg>
<seg id="42">  </seg>
<seg id="43"> Surely more than the "no". </seg>
<seg id="43">  </seg>
<seg id="44"> Okay, now I want to go back to what you did. </seg>
<seg id="44">  </seg>
<seg id="45"> "You and Nate kissed on the couch. - That's right. - At home or at your hotel? - Do you look like a scum? From me! </seg>
<seg id="45">  </seg>
<seg id="46"> Did you sit or lie down on the couch? </seg>
<seg id="46">  </seg>
<seg id="47"> We started sitting and then lying down. </seg>
<seg id="47">  </seg>
<seg id="48"> - Mh! The game is tough! Who was on it? - I'm riding. </seg>
<seg id="48">  </seg>
<seg id="49"> - Nothing else? "We kissed some more on the couch, then I said," Now I have to go to bed, so you have to go. " </seg>
<seg id="49">  </seg>
<seg id="50"> And he began to cry: "Right now?" </seg>
<seg id="50">  </seg>
<seg id="51"> And I: "Yeah, right now, go away." And he: "I make a proposal for you." </seg>
<seg id="51">  </seg>
<seg id="52"> And I: "No," and he: "Why do not you, you do not know what I mean." </seg>
<seg id="52">  </seg>
<seg id="53"> And I: "I know what you mean and the answer is no." </seg>
<seg id="53">  </seg>
<seg id="54"> And he: "How do you know what I mean?" </seg>
<seg id="54">  </seg>
<seg id="55"> And I: "You are about to say, 'we can sleep together, we do nothing,' '' just two cuddles, we sleep near, tomorrow we wake up together. ' "No, you go now and tomorrow morning we'll see you." </seg>
<seg id="55">  </seg>
<seg id="56"> Frighten by Nate! It's cute! </seg>
<seg id="56">  </seg>
<seg id="57"> For me, Jesse Letterman drowned her all night. </seg>
<seg id="57">  </seg>
<seg id="58"> - Jesse Letterman? - Remember, you can not tow tonight. </seg>
<seg id="58">  </seg>
<seg id="59"> If you go, you can come out afterwards, you can kiss them but do not bring them down because we have to go to Lake LBJ tonight and my dad has been clear on one thing, he said: </seg>
<seg id="59">  </seg>
<seg id="60"> "Tonight I will allow you and your dear friends to stay at my home on the lake," not to you and to the twisted boys "who want to fuck my daughter." </seg>
<seg id="60">  </seg>
<seg id="61"> - You talk so? - SÃƒÂ¬. - Here! </seg>
<seg id="61">  </seg>
<seg id="62"> And there is not even a way to hide it because every time I'm at the lake with my girlfriends and we're in bikini, look at pop falls to see if there's nothing left to it! </seg>
<seg id="62">  </seg>
<seg id="63"> - Girls, it's totally harmless and cute like an insect's ear! </seg>
<seg id="63">  </seg>
<seg id="64"> But when he knows that there are a bunch of nudes that sneak in his home to the lake, he likes to come and check if there is nothing missing. </seg>
<seg id="64">  </seg>
<seg id="65"> And if you foolishly make the thread, just like our giraffe here behind, win a puppy for a lifetime. </seg>
<seg id="65">  </seg>
<seg id="66"> I have a whole relationship with Ben and you are jealous because he does not include you. </seg>
<seg id="66">  </seg>
<seg id="67"> - Do you call his dad Ben? - Of course I'm not a little girl. </seg>
<seg id="67">  </seg>
<seg id="68"> - Boys when they see you? - We meet at the Chili Parlor. </seg>
<seg id="68">  </seg>
<seg id="69"> - Maybe they take some grass - not even for fucking. </seg>
<seg id="69">  </seg>
<seg id="70"> I do not want to, A, depend on those cackles, n, B, get rid of those cats. If we do not find it, we're stuck with them all the fuck in the evening. </seg>
<seg id="70">  </seg>
<seg id="71"> - Let's try with Lanna Frank. - This one is an idea, good. </seg>
<seg id="71">  </seg>
<seg id="72"> Look, your last bill before Guero's! </seg>
<seg id="72">  </seg>
<seg id="73"> What balls, you got me stew! </seg>
<seg id="73">  </seg>
<seg id="74"> What a fucking ball! We had said "every time". - All right. </seg>
<seg id="74">  </seg>
<seg id="75"> - Julia, I finish it. - Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="75">  </seg>
<seg id="76"> - Hello. - Hello. </seg>
<seg id="76">  </seg>
<seg id="77"> - Are you sitting with us? - Second one, they're with friends. </seg>
<seg id="77">  </seg>
<seg id="78"> Oh! You must be the infamous Butterfly. </seg>
<seg id="78">  </seg>
<seg id="79"> Shhh! Zitta, she still does not know anything! </seg>
<seg id="79">  </seg>
<seg id="80"> - Nothing about it? - And when do you tell her? - Then! </seg>
<seg id="80">  </seg>
<seg id="81"> - Thing? - Thank you, we'll have to tell you more then. </seg>
<seg id="81">  </seg>
<seg id="82"> Bitch! What the fuck's going on? </seg>
<seg id="82">  </seg>
<seg id="83"> Today on the radio I said something about you live. </seg>
<seg id="83">  </seg>
<seg id="84"> Julia, tell me what fuck you said about me on the radio. </seg>
<seg id="84">  </seg>
<seg id="85"> I just said that a friend named Butterfly came to see me for the weekend and we'd be going around Austin tonight and if anyone was in the area we could meet you and I described how you did and said that if someone was watching you in the city, then if you did one thing, you would have done one thing. </seg>
<seg id="85">  </seg>
<seg id="86"> Julia, am I serious, what did you say and what did you say I would do? </seg>
<seg id="86">  </seg>
<seg id="87"> Let's just say so: I could say what I said, but it would be boring, or Marcy here, being an amazing actress, could play it for us, which would give you a more accurate idea of ​​what we have in store for you tonight . </seg>
<seg id="87">  </seg>
<seg id="88"> - Okay, tell me how you like. - Do we play Marcy? - Sure! </seg>
<seg id="88">  </seg>
<seg id="89"> - Give Marcy your glass. - Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="89">  </seg>
<seg id="90"> So you are in a bar or in a bar and Marcy is a cute, very sexy, very sexy guy, or maybe a boy to die for, but not funny. </seg>
<seg id="90">  </seg>
<seg id="91"> - Anyway, it's one you picked up. - Clear. - Go, Marcy, it's up to you. </seg>
<seg id="91">  </seg>
<seg id="92"> EhilÃƒÂ ... </seg>
<seg id="92">  </seg>
<seg id="93"> How are you? </seg>
<seg id="93">  </seg>
<seg id="94"> Sorry, but are not you what's called Butterfly, by chance? </seg>
<seg id="94">  </seg>
<seg id="95"> - Yeah, right. And if you tell me your name, let's down. - Barry. </seg>
<seg id="95">  </seg>
<seg id="96"> - Very pleased, Barry. - Get me excited! Shhh! </seg>
<seg id="96">  </seg>
<seg id="97"> Listen, and ... Butterfly is your real name? </seg>
<seg id="97">  </seg>
<seg id="98"> Yeah, sure. And how do you know my name, Barry? </seg>
<seg id="98">  </seg>
<seg id="99"> I heard Jungle Julia broadcast this morning. </seg>
<seg id="99">  </seg>
<seg id="100"> - Are you listening to him? Really! - Yeah, I hear it every morning. </seg>
<seg id="100">  </seg>
<seg id="101"> - Every morning, but come on! - Yeah, Julia is the most pompous woman in the city. </seg>
<seg id="101">  </seg>
<seg id="102"> - Do not you think your ass is a little bigger in your opinion? - No, shit. </seg>
<seg id="102">  </seg>
<seg id="103"> My ass looks like me a lot. </seg>
<seg id="103">  </seg>
<seg id="104"> What you find is a nice black ass. </seg>
<seg id="104">  </seg>
<seg id="105"> It's what she always says, but the truth that she does not have a nice black ass at all, she only has two huge lashes. - What the fuck are you talking about ?! </seg>
<seg id="105">  </seg>
<seg id="106"> - What do I say? I'm going to go, darling. - Okay, let's go: </seg>
<seg id="106">  </seg>
<seg id="107"> For your information, shit shit, lots of blacks, and lots of white bastards if I've spared a world to worship my ass. </seg>
<seg id="107">  </seg>
<seg id="108"> I still have the marks of their teeth on my back. </seg>
<seg id="108">  </seg>
<seg id="109"> - If you do not offer me a drink, did I give up my glass? - Well, okay, okay. </seg>
<seg id="109">  </seg>
<seg id="110"> "Then, Butterfly, do we have a drink?" - With extreme pleasure. - What are we doing? - What about a Margarita? </seg>
<seg id="110">  </seg>
<seg id="111"> Eccotelo. </seg>
<seg id="111">  </seg>
<seg id="112"> After they have offered you to drink and raise your glass for a toast, you have to look right in your eyes and repeat this poem: "The forest is magnificent, deep in dusk" and I promise to keep "" miles away to go before sleeping ". </seg>
<seg id="112">  </seg>
<seg id="113"> Did you hear, Butterfly? </seg>
<seg id="113">  </seg>
<seg id="114"> "Miles to go before sleeping". </seg>
<seg id="114">  </seg>
<seg id="115"> So if they tell you this, you have to do a lap dance. - That?! </seg>
<seg id="115">  </seg>
<seg id="116"> If they call you Butterfly, they offer you drink and say poetry, you do a lap dance! - Fanculo! I do nothing! You can do it or not, but if you do not, here in Austin you think you're a cacassotto, and I do not think you want someone to think about it. </seg>
<seg id="116">  </seg>
<seg id="117"> I do not just lap dance because you said that. </seg>
<seg id="117">  </seg>
<seg id="118"> - Come on, it's funny! - It's funny if these shit touches me! </seg>
<seg id="118">  </seg>
<seg id="119"> Look, you do not have to do it to anyone, if you do not. </seg>
<seg id="119">  </seg>
<seg id="120"> I said you would have done it to the first one who says poetry, so if somebody comes to you to make a fig, tell him that you've done it before in another place. </seg>
<seg id="120">  </seg>
<seg id="121"> No harm, no problem, and we also remedies for free drinking. But maybe tonight, a little later, when you have drunk a bit, you feel relaxed, safe between your friends ... If a cute, very sexy, sexy, spicy guy dies, but not funny look and tell you poetry, maybe you did it before or maybe you did not. </seg>
<seg id="121">  </seg>
<seg id="122"> Lanna Frank, where are you? - Fuck this, that's a good question! </seg>
<seg id="122">  </seg>
<seg id="123"> Lanna Frank! Where are you? </seg>
<seg id="123">  </seg>
<seg id="124"> Come here, we're waiting for you. </seg>
<seg id="124">  </seg>
<seg id="125"> Fuck! Wait. </seg>
<seg id="125">  </seg>
<seg id="126"> Where are you? </seg>
<seg id="126">  </seg>
<seg id="127"> All right, come on, we're waiting for you. </seg>
<seg id="127">  </seg>
<seg id="128"> Forget it, we do not come to you. Come on, as you said. </seg>
<seg id="128">  </seg>
<seg id="129"> - How's the story, Shauna and the girls at the lake on the weekend? - Shauna? </seg>
<seg id="129">  </seg>
<seg id="130"> Oh! Shit, I ... </seg>
<seg id="130">  </seg>
<seg id="131"> No! There is only one thing that girls from all over the world who call themselves Shanna have in common with each other: We share the name Shauna and hate the people who call us so. </seg>
<seg id="131">  </seg>
<seg id="132"> Do not forget, I'm Shanna Banana, not Shauna Banona. </seg>
<seg id="132">  </seg>
<seg id="133"> Yeah, but before my crap my cock was climbing? </seg>
<seg id="133">  </seg>
<seg id="134"> Yeah, not really up there, but ... </seg>
<seg id="134">  </seg>
<seg id="135"> - Guys, Warren sends you a shot. You know the rules of the house: </seg>
<seg id="135">  </seg>
<seg id="136"> If he sends the shot, you need to get them. - Why? - Hey, that's the rules, baby. Warren says, we do. </seg>
<seg id="136">  </seg>
<seg id="137"> How I love this philosophy: Warren says, we do. </seg>
<seg id="137">  </seg>
<seg id="138"> - Then, guys, let's do it! - SÃƒÂ¬. - What's the matter? </seg>
<seg id="138">  </seg>
<seg id="139"> Zitta, first drinks, then questions. Get the horses off! </seg>
<seg id="139">  </seg>
<seg id="140"> Ah! </seg>
<seg id="140">  </seg>
<seg id="141"> Ah! </seg>
<seg id="141">  </seg>
<seg id="142"> Is it a fantastic thing or is not it a fantastic thing? </seg>
<seg id="142">  </seg>
<seg id="143"> But what the fucking stuff is? </seg>
<seg id="143">  </seg>
<seg id="144"> Chartreuse, the only liqueur so good that has given its name to a color. </seg>
<seg id="144">  </seg>
<seg id="145"> Who is ready for dos Chartreuse? </seg>
<seg id="145">  </seg>
<seg id="146"> Too much. I'm going out to get a cigarette. </seg>
<seg id="146">  </seg>
<seg id="147"> Do not get too close to the lighter, huh? </seg>
<seg id="147">  </seg>
<seg id="148"> - Drink that we bring you? - Shanna Banana? </seg>
<seg id="148">  </seg>
<seg id="149"> Another Long lsland ice tea giant. </seg>
<seg id="149">  </seg>
<seg id="150"> Bombay Sapphire tonic, no ice. Strong, huh? But good kids! </seg>
<seg id="150">  </seg>
<seg id="151"> Plate, one of the parking lights is off. Why do not you light it up? </seg>
<seg id="151">  </seg>
<seg id="152"> - Ah! - Oh! - Jesus Christ! </seg>
<seg id="152">  </seg>
<seg id="153"> I'm fucking scared, you're a big dick! </seg>
<seg id="153">  </seg>
<seg id="154"> I swear, Arlene, I did not want to scare you. </seg>
<seg id="154">  </seg>
<seg id="155"> - I only had a great luck. - What the fuck! - Let's go inside. - Wait. - Why? - Why do not we give a nice kiss? Where, here? Are you stupid? Not even at the bar, in front of the entrance? </seg>
<seg id="155">  </seg>
<seg id="156"> - No, in my car. - LÃ¤ out? </seg>
<seg id="156">  </seg>
<seg id="157"> - Rain that seems to be in Vietnam. - In the car it does not rain. </seg>
<seg id="157">  </seg>
<seg id="158"> Look, I do not get you wet. I can assure you. </seg>
<seg id="158">  </seg>
<seg id="159"> It is the first time I feel a man boast of this. </seg>
<seg id="159">  </seg>
<seg id="160"> Ah, ah, ah! You know what I meant. </seg>
<seg id="160">  </seg>
<seg id="161"> Since you go to Lake LBJ and that we can not come, let us give a kiss! - Yeah, but stop crying. </seg>
<seg id="161">  </seg>
<seg id="162"> You make me even more crap. </seg>
<seg id="162">  </seg>
<seg id="163"> Okay, but I do not want him to know all the damn bar, so we go in the car and kiss for exactly 6 minutes, are you? </seg>
<seg id="163">  </seg>
<seg id="164"> - Sure. - No, no, are you or not? </seg>
<seg id="164">  </seg>
<seg id="165"> If you start to rush when I leave after 6 minutes, it's better to go back to the bar right away. - I'm in. Do not fry. </seg>
<seg id="165">  </seg>
<seg id="166"> - And do not pray. - And do not pray. When you say "finished" it's over. </seg>
<seg id="166">  </seg>
<seg id="167"> Looks like I remember it. Let's go. </seg>
<seg id="167">  </seg>
<seg id="168"> You have two tasks: Kiss well and do not wet my hair. </seg>
<seg id="168">  </seg>
<seg id="169"> You do not have to try to take it away before Christian Simonson arrives. </seg>
<seg id="169">  </seg>
<seg id="170"> You have to take her away before Christian Simonson arrives! </seg>
<seg id="170">  </seg>
<seg id="171"> That changes? They are from Shanna's father and the kids are absolutely forbidden. </seg>
<seg id="171">  </seg>
<seg id="172"> Then, having brought the girls to drink, in quick succession but without pointing to us, we order two more rounds of shot. - Do you think they're scolding you? </seg>
<seg id="172">  </seg>
<seg id="173"> We will be very convincing. And it is time to raise the volume. We play heavy, we go to JÃƒÂ © germeister. </seg>
<seg id="173">  </seg>
<seg id="174"> What the fuck are you saying? Women do not drink JÃƒÂ¤ germeister. </seg>
<seg id="174">  </seg>
<seg id="175"> As long as a male pays for a drink, a whore will drink anything. </seg>
<seg id="175">  </seg>
<seg id="176"> Let's get off at least a lap of JÃƒÂ¤ germeister in those gorges. </seg>
<seg id="176">  </seg>
<seg id="177"> And then let's see if they do another. </seg>
<seg id="177">  </seg>
<seg id="178"> You never know, they might say, "Who cares?" </seg>
<seg id="178">  </seg>
<seg id="179"> And then "no kids at the lake home" becomes "two guys at the lake home". - That's right. </seg>
<seg id="179">  </seg>
<seg id="180"> You will see that Shanna will suck the banana and get a Buttery Nipple. </seg>
<seg id="180">  </seg>
<seg id="181"> - Does Julia like sweet liquor like? - Key Lime Pie. What a fucking shit! No one resists a sweet liqueur. </seg>
<seg id="181">  </seg>
<seg id="182"> Fuck! Look at that, it looks BJ. What if he also brought the monkey. </seg>
<seg id="182">  </seg>
<seg id="183"> Jesus Christ! </seg>
<seg id="183">  </seg>
<seg id="184"> That guy got scared by falling from the time machine. </seg>
<seg id="184">  </seg>
<seg id="185"> Warren, do you give me a chicken soup for Stroker Ace, please? </seg>
<seg id="185">  </seg>
<seg id="186"> Where were you two? - I got something in the car. Nate accompanied me with her umbrella and I did not get wet. </seg>
<seg id="186">  </seg>
<seg id="187"> - Good for you, Nate! - You see that pretty girl alone at the counter? </seg>
<seg id="187">  </seg>
<seg id="188"> - Who, the poor hippie? - Meow! It's not a hippie. </seg>
<seg id="188">  </seg>
<seg id="189"> It has the hippie air. </seg>
<seg id="189">  </seg>
<seg id="190"> You're a treasure, Timmy. Well, you know what happened to her? </seg>
<seg id="190">  </seg>
<seg id="191"> No, but I know it's a dry bun with her dyed hair. </seg>
<seg id="191">  </seg>
<seg id="192"> Did you want to tell her story? What happened to her? </seg>
<seg id="192">  </seg>
<seg id="193"> Warren? Do I recommend someone here to make a pass? </seg>
<seg id="193">  </seg>
<seg id="194"> My lady, my carriage is her. What are you doing, ears? </seg>
<seg id="194">  </seg>
<seg id="195"> There is "eavesdropping" and "impossible to hear". I think I belong to the second category. </seg>
<seg id="195">  </seg>
<seg id="196"> If I understand, Icy Hot, do you offer me a tear? </seg>
<seg id="196">  </seg>
<seg id="197"> I'm offering you a tear, if when I leave, you're ready too. </seg>
<seg id="197">  </seg>
<seg id="198"> - And when do you think you're going away? - I'm not really thinking about it. </seg>
<seg id="198">  </seg>
<seg id="199"> But as soon as I do, you'll be the first to know. </seg>
<seg id="199">  </seg>
<seg id="200"> And will you be able to drive afterwards? </seg>
<seg id="200">  </seg>
<seg id="201"> I know the appearances deceive, but I really are timid. </seg>
<seg id="201">  </seg>
<seg id="202"> I did not drink tonic water and lime all night, and now I'm preparing for my big cocktail. </seg>
<seg id="202">  </seg>
<seg id="203"> - That would? - Virgin Pina Colada. </seg>
<seg id="203">  </seg>
<seg id="204"> Okay, why does a person who does not drink alcohol spend hours in a bar drinking almost water? </seg>
<seg id="204">  </seg>
<seg id="205"> A bar offers a mountain of things beyond the alcohol. </seg>
<seg id="205">  </seg>
<seg id="206"> Mh! You say? Eg? </seg>
<seg id="206">  </seg>
<seg id="207"> Women. A plate of Nacho Grande. The company of several fascinating individuals like Warren, for example. I love it. </seg>
<seg id="207">  </seg>
<seg id="208"> Alcohol is just the lubricant for the encounters that a bar can offer. </seg>
<seg id="208">  </seg>
<seg id="209"> - What, cowboy philosophy? - I'm not a cowboy, Pam. </seg>
<seg id="209">  </seg>
<seg id="210"> I'm a stuntman. But it is a very, very easy mistake to make. </seg>
<seg id="210">  </seg>
<seg id="211"> How do you know my name? </seg>
<seg id="211">  </seg>
<seg id="212"> When you talked to Warren, I could not hear it. </seg>
<seg id="212">  </seg>
<seg id="213"> There may be. And how do you call me, Icy? </seg>
<seg id="213">  </seg>
<seg id="214"> - Stuntman Mike. - Stuntman Mike is your name? </seg>
<seg id="214">  </seg>
<seg id="215"> Ask him who you want. </seg>
<seg id="215">  </seg>
<seg id="216"> - Warren, who is this here? - Stuntman Mike! </seg>
<seg id="216">  </seg>
<seg id="217"> - Ah! And who the fuck is Stuntman Mike? - A stuntman. </seg>
<seg id="217">  </seg>
<seg id="218"> We're there, Pam. It's the moment of my big cocktail. </seg>
<seg id="218">  </seg>
<seg id="219"> Well, Stuntman Mike, since I have an open account here, can I offer you Pina Colada non-alcoholic? </seg>
<seg id="219">  </seg>
<seg id="220"> "No doubt, Pam, very pleased. - Warren? </seg>
<seg id="220">  </seg>
<seg id="221"> A Virgin Pina Colada for my friend stuntman </seg>
<seg id="221">  </seg>
<seg id="222"> and for me another Cadillac Cabo Wabo Margarita. </seg>
<seg id="222">  </seg>
<seg id="223"> Cabo Wabo, Virgin. </seg>
<seg id="223">  </seg>
<seg id="224"> That table seems to have sucked all your attention. - That girl's the billboard out here? - SÃƒÂ¬. There is nothing to say, it's a beautiful girl. </seg>
<seg id="224">  </seg>
<seg id="225"> We have jin, tequila, whiskey ... </seg>
<seg id="225">  </seg>
<seg id="226"> - And what hair! - Embalmed, all balm. </seg>
<seg id="226">  </seg>
<seg id="227"> - Do I have some jealousy or badness? - It's wrong. </seg>
<seg id="227">  </seg>
<seg id="228"> If you want to get involved with Jungle Julia, there's a very simple way, you know? - Seriously? - Ah. ah. </seg>
<seg id="228">  </seg>
<seg id="229"> - And what would that be? - To be famous. </seg>
<seg id="229">  </seg>
<seg id="230"> Even if you do not look for it, they'll find you. </seg>
<seg id="230">  </seg>
<seg id="231"> And it is better that you do not know what he did for that billboard. </seg>
<seg id="231">  </seg>
<seg id="232"> To yours, sucker. 'Fuck! </seg>
<seg id="232">  </seg>
<seg id="233"> What will I ever do to you? </seg>
<seg id="233">  </seg>
<seg id="234"> We went to school together, from kindergarten to high school. </seg>
<seg id="234">  </seg>
<seg id="235"> That's what he did to me. </seg>
<seg id="235">  </seg>
<seg id="236"> It was high as well as 12 years old! It was a giant, a monster! </seg>
<seg id="236">  </seg>
<seg id="237"> Half of the boys still broke today, at school kicking them and terrorizing them. </seg>
<seg id="237">  </seg>
<seg id="238"> I see. Did she even give you and rub the chocolate milk? </seg>
<seg id="238">  </seg>
<seg id="239"> That Godzilla bitches? I'll kick a couple of times. </seg>
<seg id="239">  </seg>
<seg id="240"> I am a girl, not a nice nerone, but not to give in to Julia Lucai, I would have been killed. </seg>
<seg id="240">  </seg>
<seg id="241"> Hello! You look like a famous one. </seg>
<seg id="241">  </seg>
<seg id="242"> - Do you look like that? - No, no, seriously. </seg>
<seg id="242">  </seg>
<seg id="243"> - Do a little bit, what are you doing? - Seriously? </seg>
<seg id="243">  </seg>
<seg id="244"> I put my ass on to take off my record label. </seg>
<seg id="244">  </seg>
<seg id="245"> But why that girl wanted my picture, it's because I'm a DJ zone. </seg>
<seg id="245">  </seg>
<seg id="246"> Wait a moment. </seg>
<seg id="246">  </seg>
<seg id="247"> - There's a billboard in front of Big Kahuna Burger, right? - SÃƒÂ¬. There is one here too, Zatoichi. GiÃƒÂ! </seg>
<seg id="247">  </seg>
<seg id="248"> - Jungle Julia Lucai. - Stuntman Mike McKay. - Good! </seg>
<seg id="248">  </seg>
<seg id="249"> Pleased to meet you, Stuntman Mike. </seg>
<seg id="249">  </seg>
<seg id="250"> Now, sorry, but I and my friends are still doing this. Want a shot? </seg>
<seg id="250">  </seg>
<seg id="251"> Thanks, Julia. As if I had accepted, but no, thank you. </seg>
<seg id="251">  </seg>
<seg id="252"> - As you want. - You know that... </seg>
<seg id="252">  </seg>
<seg id="253"> Porca troia! </seg>
<seg id="253">  </seg>
<seg id="254"> Sorry, nothing. </seg>
<seg id="254">  </seg>
<seg id="255"> But what the hell is that? </seg>
<seg id="255">  </seg>
<seg id="256"> - And that's what I did! </seg>
<seg id="256">  </seg>
<seg id="257"> What a nice guarantor you have! </seg>
<seg id="257">  </seg>
<seg id="258"> I asked him what movies you did and he said he did not know a fuck. </seg>
<seg id="258">  </seg>
<seg id="259"> Technically I do not know if he really did anything. </seg>
<seg id="259">  </seg>
<seg id="260"> He once made me see a "On Arizona's borders", there was one who fell from horseback, saying he was him. </seg>
<seg id="260">  </seg>
<seg id="261"> Do you know the "Virginian" show? </seg>
<seg id="261">  </seg>
<seg id="262"> - SÃƒÂ¬. "There was another actor on that show, Gary Clarke, and I looked a little like him. </seg>
<seg id="262">  </seg>
<seg id="263"> Obviously before I cut myself while I was shaving. </seg>
<seg id="263">  </seg>
<seg id="264"> For me it's sexy! </seg>
<seg id="264">  </seg>
<seg id="265"> Do you know you're so sweet that you make sugar look like salt? </seg>
<seg id="265">  </seg>
<seg id="266"> Anyway, I did "The Virgin" as a counterpart to Gary Clarke. </seg>
<seg id="266">  </seg>
<seg id="267"> And when they made the second set, Lee Majors came and I also made his own stand-up. </seg>
<seg id="267">  </seg>
<seg id="268"> From there, I specialize in car accidents. </seg>
<seg id="268">  </seg>
<seg id="269"> Yeah, I did almost all the third series of "Vegas". </seg>
<seg id="269">  </seg>
<seg id="270"> I was the contingent of Robert Urich. </seg>
<seg id="270">  </seg>
<seg id="271"> Then Bob made another series, "Gavilan", and he also brought me to that, so far, well ... </seg>
<seg id="271">  </seg>
<seg id="272"> After that... </seg>
<seg id="272">  </seg>
<seg id="273"> At least one of these series I just named, you know that? </seg>
<seg id="273">  </seg>
<seg id="274"> - Not even one. - I'm sorry. - No. </seg>
<seg id="274">  </seg>
<seg id="275"> Wait, explain a little. How is one becoming a stuntman, Stuntman Mike? </seg>
<seg id="275">  </seg>
<seg id="276"> In Hollywood all those who are so stupid to throw themselves down the stairs, find one who pays them to do so. </seg>
<seg id="276">  </seg>
<seg id="277"> But I did not go around like everyone else doing stunts. - CioÃ¨? - My brother helped me. - Who is your brother? - Stuntman Bob. </seg>
<seg id="277">  </seg>
<seg id="278"> - I'm ready to play. - Go, get it back. </seg>
<seg id="278">  </seg>
<seg id="279"> - We have a few laps of advantage. - Let the party begin! - SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="279">  </seg>
<seg id="280"> Anyway I'm sorry. Do you want to forgive me? </seg>
<seg id="280">  </seg>
<seg id="281"> But you'll have to be pretty with me for as long as I'm in town. </seg>
<seg id="281">  </seg>
<seg id="282"> - Promised. Ready to go to the lake? - Mh-mh. </seg>
<seg id="282">  </seg>
<seg id="283"> - Want to bring your friend? - You said only women. If you do, Shanna will not have any problems. What do you want to do? </seg>
<seg id="283">  </seg>
<seg id="284"> - Even men or women alone? - Only women. - Good idea. </seg>
<seg id="284">  </seg>
<seg id="285"> Lord ... </seg>
<seg id="285">  </seg>
<seg id="286"> - Thank you. - Health, Butterfly. </seg>
<seg id="286">  </seg>
<seg id="287"> "The forest is magnificent, deep in dusk". "And I've promised to keep miles and miles before going to sleep." </seg>
<seg id="287">  </seg>
<seg id="288"> Did you hear me, Butterfly? </seg>
<seg id="288">  </seg>
<seg id="289"> "Miles to go before sleeping". </seg>
<seg id="289">  </seg>
<seg id="290"> - I'm sorry, Stuntman Burt. - Mike. </seg>
<seg id="290">  </seg>
<seg id="291"> - Mike. The dances are over. - ÃƒÃ † la veritÃƒÂ? </seg>
<seg id="291">  </seg>
<seg id="292"> So, I missed my chance. </seg>
<seg id="292">  </seg>
<seg id="293"> Do I scare you? </seg>
<seg id="293">  </seg>
<seg id="294"> For the scar? </seg>
<seg id="294">  </seg>
<seg id="295"> - For the car. - Yeah, I know, sorry. </seg>
<seg id="295">  </seg>
<seg id="296"> It's the mother's car. </seg>
<seg id="296">  </seg>
<seg id="297"> - What did you do, are you crazy? - No! But that's what I like about Austin, which is so damn small. </seg>
<seg id="297">  </seg>
<seg id="298"> - Have you seen him yet? - I saw him out of Guero's. </seg>
<seg id="298">  </seg>
<seg id="299"> Yeah, I also saw you out of Guero's. </seg>
<seg id="299">  </seg>
<seg id="300"> You saw my car and I got your legs. </seg>
<seg id="300">  </seg>
<seg id="301"> I'm not kidding you, but I do not want to eat you for that. </seg>
<seg id="301">  </seg>
<seg id="302"> - Do you think you really believe it? - I'm not following you, Butterfly. </seg>
<seg id="302">  </seg>
<seg id="303"> I've been lucky. </seg>
<seg id="303">  </seg>
<seg id="304"> Then? What do you do with our lap dance? </seg>
<seg id="304">  </seg>
<seg id="305"> I'm sorry, the offer was saying "once only", and she has already made it out of Anthony's. </seg>
<seg id="305">  </seg>
<seg id="306"> - It's not true. - What do you know about it? </seg>
<seg id="306">  </seg>
<seg id="307"> I'm good at certain things. And you have the air a little touch. </seg>
<seg id="307">  </seg>
<seg id="308"> - What does "touch" mean? - Sore throat. </seg>
<seg id="308">  </seg>
<seg id="309"> - Why should I be hurt? "Because you were expecting people to torment you all night, but from your gaze I would say that nobody has tormented you. And this hurt your feelings a bit. Few things are as fascinating as the ego wounded by a beautiful angel. </seg>
<seg id="309">  </seg>
<seg id="310"> Then? What do you do with our lap dance? </seg>
<seg id="310">  </seg>
<seg id="311"> You will have to book for the next time. </seg>
<seg id="311">  </seg>
<seg id="312"> But since it's part of a couple of days, I do not think we'll be there next time. </seg>
<seg id="312">  </seg>
<seg id="313"> But he does not do anything. </seg>
<seg id="313">  </seg>
<seg id="314"> I can see if my presence embarrasses you. </seg>
<seg id="314">  </seg>
<seg id="315"> You are, however, a pretty girl and I like it. </seg>
<seg id="315">  </seg>
<seg id="316"> I need to tell you something, though. </seg>
<seg id="316">  </seg>
<seg id="317"> Do you know what people say? </seg>
<seg id="317">  </seg>
<seg id="318"> "You are filed, I've got you now," or "I've got you in the archives now." </seg>
<seg id="318">  </seg>
<seg id="319"> Well, let me have a phone book here. And all those I know are in this section. </seg>
<seg id="319">  </seg>
<seg id="320"> And now I've met you and you also end up in the phone book. </seg>
<seg id="320">  </seg>
<seg id="321"> Yeah, but I'm afraid I'll have to put you under the word "cacasotto". </seg>
<seg id="321">  </seg>
<seg id="322"> What if I do it? </seg>
<seg id="322">  </seg>
<seg id="323"> Then I could not put you under the word "cacasotto", what do you say? </seg>
<seg id="323">  </seg>
<seg id="324"> - How did you say you called? - Stuntman Mike. </seg>
<seg id="324">  </seg>
<seg id="325"> Well, Mike Stuntman, I'm Butterfly and my friend Jungle Julia says the jukebox is very much stocked. </seg>
<seg id="325">  </seg>
<seg id="326"> - Yeah, he's right. - Eh, yes. </seg>
<seg id="326">  </seg>
<seg id="327"> Why do not you go prepare for your lap dance? </seg>
<seg id="327">  </seg>
<seg id="328"> I said, "A cute, very sexy, sexy guy," "lousy, but not funny, which, let's say, you picked up." Then you did not understand anything. </seg>
<seg id="328">  </seg>
<seg id="329"> Tonight is fucking old Mike. </seg>
<seg id="329">  </seg>
<seg id="330"> "With the years he has, he might be my father. - I still feel, darling. </seg>
<seg id="330">  </seg>
<seg id="331"> Hello. Bye Bye. </seg>
<seg id="331">  </seg>
<seg id="332"> - Fuck, she's really scared! - Yeah, I wanted something awesome. </seg>
<seg id="332">  </seg>
<seg id="333"> Fear tends to impress. </seg>
<seg id="333">  </seg>
<seg id="334"> - And is it safe? - No, it's more than safe. It's a death proof. </seg>
<seg id="334">  </seg>
<seg id="335"> How do you make a dead-end machine? Well, it's the job of a stuntman. Do you see those movies where the machines make accidents that nobody could get out of? </seg>
<seg id="335">  </seg>
<seg id="336"> - SÃƒÂ¬. - And how do you realize them? </seg>
<seg id="336">  </seg>
<seg id="337"> At the PC? </seg>
<seg id="337">  </seg>
<seg id="338"> Yes, sadly, Pam, today most of the time is as you say. </seg>
<seg id="338">  </seg>
<seg id="339"> But at the time or nothing, at the time of "Zero Point", "Zozza Mary, crazy Gary", of "Violence on the Highway", real cars fluttered against real machines, with real idiots driving them. </seg>
<seg id="339">  </seg>
<seg id="340"> At that time, you gave the stunt the car you wanted to smash, they reinforced that bastard everywhere and voilÃƒÂ¤, they drove out a beautiful dead-end machine. </seg>
<seg id="340">  </seg>
<seg id="341"> It does not look like shit, I did not know there were dead-end machines. </seg>
<seg id="341">  </seg>
<seg id="342"> I can crumble it into a brick wall going 200 kilometers an hour, just to see that it does. </seg>
<seg id="342">  </seg>
<seg id="343"> Fuck, but here the passenger puts it in box, why? </seg>
<seg id="343">  </seg>
<seg id="344"> Because it's a movie car. Sometimes when an accident occurs, the filmmaker puts us the camera to film the incident from the inside. </seg>
<seg id="344">  </seg>
<seg id="345"> And here's the room, it's called "crash box". Here it is. </seg>
<seg id="345">  </seg>
<seg id="346"> Have a seat. </seg>
<seg id="346">  </seg>
<seg id="347"> When you asked me to accompany you, you did not say you did not have the place to go by car. </seg>
<seg id="347">  </seg>
<seg id="348"> Truly, I did not ask you to accompany you. You asked me for a walk and I said yes. Look at the positive side: I can not try putting one hand on my knee. Yeah, it's the only positive side. </seg>
<seg id="348">  </seg>
<seg id="349"> I knew it. </seg>
<seg id="349">  </seg>
<seg id="350"> "Then, Pam, where do you go, left or right?" - Right. - It's a pity. - Why? </seg>
<seg id="350">  </seg>
<seg id="351"> Because there was 50% of the possibilities to go left as right. </seg>
<seg id="351">  </seg>
<seg id="352"> We, on the other hand, will go both to the left. You could have chosen to go to the left and it would take a while to start scaring. </seg>
<seg id="352">  </seg>
<seg id="353"> But since you're on the other side, I'm afraid you'll have to start afraid immediately. </seg>
<seg id="353">  </seg>
<seg id="354"> Fuck you ?! </seg>
<seg id="354">  </seg>
<seg id="355"> Stronzo succulent, bastard! Get me out of here! </seg>
<seg id="355">  </seg>
<seg id="356"> I break your car! Stop this fucking machine! </seg>
<seg id="356">  </seg>
<seg id="357"> Okay ... Look ... I understand. </seg>
<seg id="357">  </seg>
<seg id="358"> It's all a joke. It's too funny. </seg>
<seg id="358">  </seg>
<seg id="359"> But please, let me get down. I hurt myself. I do not tell anyone, I swear to you. I know it's a joke. </seg>
<seg id="359">  </seg>
<seg id="360"> Please, I promise I will not tell anyone. </seg>
<seg id="360">  </seg>
<seg id="361"> - Let me down, please. - Hey, Pam! </seg>
<seg id="361">  </seg>
<seg id="362"> Do you remember when I said the car was deadly? </seg>
<seg id="362">  </seg>
<seg id="363"> It was not a lie. </seg>
<seg id="363">  </seg>
<seg id="364"> This machine is 100% dead-end. </seg>
<seg id="364">  </seg>
<seg id="365"> But to enjoy this advantage, darling, you should be sitting exactly where I am. </seg>
<seg id="365">  </seg>
<seg id="366"> And now it's the turn of my other friendly friends. </seg>
<seg id="366">  </seg>
<seg id="367"> No, no, no, I'm Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich. </seg>
<seg id="367">  </seg>
<seg id="368"> You got it? Thanks, honey. You put it right now, right? </seg>
<seg id="368">  </seg>
<seg id="369"> Great. </seg>
<seg id="369">  </seg>
<seg id="370"> Wow! </seg>
<seg id="370">  </seg>
<seg id="371"> Bye Bye. </seg>
<seg id="371">  </seg>
<seg id="372"> - What do you want to hear? - Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick and Tich. </seg>
<seg id="372">  </seg>
<seg id="373"> - Who? - Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick and Tich. </seg>
<seg id="373">  </seg>
<seg id="374"> - And who the fuck are they? - For your information, Pete Townshend at some point was about to leave the Who and if he did, he would end up in this group, so they would become Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick, Tich, and Pete. It was better if he went there. Yeah, he got us! More, make me feel stronger! </seg>
<seg id="374">  </seg>
<seg id="375"> Did not see anything? </seg>
<seg id="375">  </seg>
<seg id="376"> No, I do not remember. </seg>
<seg id="376">  </seg>
<seg id="377"> Dr. Davis in the clinic. </seg>
<seg id="377">  </seg>
<seg id="378"> Tell me, what is the patient's prognosis, Dr. Block? </seg>
<seg id="378">  </seg>
<seg id="379"> - I do not think they are his business. - Come on, sister, just say enough. </seg>
<seg id="379">  </seg>
<seg id="380"> How bad is it? </seg>
<seg id="380">  </seg>
<seg id="381"> That type is beautifully ruined: Broken nose, broken teeth, broken clavicle, and the left index is also rubbed. - Is it still alive? </seg>
<seg id="381">  </seg>
<seg id="382"> He was lucky. </seg>
<seg id="382">  </seg>
<seg id="383"> - Need anything else? - No, it's more than enough. Thank you, Dr. Block. </seg>
<seg id="383">  </seg>
<seg id="384"> Son of a bitch! </seg>
<seg id="384">  </seg>
<seg id="385"> - So, daddy, what do you think? - You know, son number one, what I think is a damned macabre that I can say aloud. </seg>
<seg id="385">  </seg>
<seg id="386"> - Try it anyway, pa. - We have a case of vehicle murder. </seg>
<seg id="386">  </seg>
<seg id="387"> Our old man killed those pretty girls. </seg>
<seg id="387">  </seg>
<seg id="388"> He used a car and not a hatch, but they were dead too. </seg>
<seg id="388">  </seg>
<seg id="389"> - What are you going to do, huh? - They will not do anything, damn it! </seg>
<seg id="389">  </seg>
<seg id="390"> The prosecutor says there is no crime. </seg>
<seg id="390">  </seg>
<seg id="391"> Each of those poor girls was swimming in the alcohol, fluctuating in the grass, and the old Hooper of lÃƒÂ, instead, is cleaned like a lamb. </seg>
<seg id="391">  </seg>
<seg id="392"> But you are sure? Do you really think he killed those girls? </seg>
<seg id="392">  </seg>
<seg id="393"> I can not prove it. But since thinking does not cost anything, I can think so, so I think so. </seg>
<seg id="393">  </seg>
<seg id="394"> Yeah, but he's too bad. </seg>
<seg id="394">  </seg>
<seg id="395"> Yeah, it's bad, but damn it, those pretty girls seemed to chew and then spit out a fucking giant. </seg>
<seg id="395">  </seg>
<seg id="396"> - How come no one survived? - Fuck! </seg>
<seg id="396">  </seg>
<seg id="397"> Two tons of metal, flesh and bone, and old dear Newton. How did the fuck survive? </seg>
<seg id="397">  </seg>
<seg id="398"> PerchÃƒÂ ©? </seg>
<seg id="398">  </seg>
<seg id="399"> See, I can assume it's a sex thing. </seg>
<seg id="399">  </seg>
<seg id="400"> There can not be anything else. </seg>
<seg id="400">  </seg>
<seg id="401"> Impact at high speed, twisted plates, broken glasses, four souls taken at the same instant. </seg>
<seg id="401">  </seg>
<seg id="402"> Perhaps just so, the degenerate man can shoot his gelatinous stuff. </seg>
<seg id="402">  </seg>
<seg id="403"> We can only accuse that carburetor of a car driver with that box of death, that is, the old dear public corruption. </seg>
<seg id="403">  </seg>
<seg id="404"> But a damned bartender has come over who will testify that Stuntman Mike did not drink all evening and that his passenger had been relieved by his boyfriend in a damn rain and asked her for a walk. </seg>
<seg id="404">  </seg>
<seg id="405"> On paper, he looks like he wants to give her a hand. </seg>
<seg id="405">  </seg>
<seg id="406"> - So, so he'll see the jury. - So what do you do, huh? </seg>
<seg id="406">  </seg>
<seg id="407"> I could only work on the case in the free hours. </seg>
<seg id="407">  </seg>
<seg id="408"> Look for evidence, demonstrate theory, whatever it is, and become the torment of that sullen son of a bitch. </seg>
<seg id="408">  </seg>
<seg id="409"> Wherever he goes, I go. Or I could commit the same amount of time and energy to follow the NASCAR circuit, son. Yeah, I'd love a lot. </seg>
<seg id="409">  </seg>
<seg id="410"> And I would be much happier if I chose the second. </seg>
<seg id="410">  </seg>
<seg id="411"> And just because I can not punish that Frankenstein for what he did, I tell you, as the Lord told John, that if he were to do it again, I'm sure he will not be here in Texas. </seg>
<seg id="411">  </seg>
<seg id="412"> - Were you on the same plane? - I'm 4th and he's 7th. </seg>
<seg id="412">  </seg>
<seg id="413"> - Who in the room? - In my. </seg>
<seg id="413">  </seg>
<seg id="414"> - Then what happened? - We kissed him in the lobby for 10 minutes and then I sent him to his room. - And how does this rock kiss this Rock? You do not know what a good one it is! It has soft lips, all to bite. </seg>
<seg id="414">  </seg>
<seg id="415"> - I love the soft lips! - Then it's really big, he turned me and he put me back and with his huge mannea touched my throat, he took my head back, he bent over me and kissed me from behind. </seg>
<seg id="415">  </seg>
<seg id="416"> - Fuck, it looks exciting! - Mh, it was exciting. </seg>
<seg id="416">  </seg>
<seg id="417"> And then nothing else? Did you send it away? </seg>
<seg id="417">  </seg>
<seg id="418"> - How did he get it? - But why are we stopping here? </seg>
<seg id="418">  </seg>
<seg id="419"> If I have to drive to take Zoe at the airport, I need a coffee bean! "Since you go to the bar, do you still get vodka and some sugar-free Red Bulls?" </seg>
<seg id="419">  </seg>
<seg id="420"> - You did not realize you were awake. - It's so, I sleep. </seg>
<seg id="420">  </seg>
<seg id="421"> Remember: Vodka, a few Red Bulls without sugar and the Red Apple Tans. </seg>
<seg id="421">  </seg>
<seg id="422"> - What a fuck! Mica I stopped to make you the expense! </seg>
<seg id="422">  </seg>
<seg id="423"> - Do you know how to get to the airport? - Sure. </seg>
<seg id="423">  </seg>
<seg id="424"> Then put yourself in the wheel, because after you drive. </seg>
<seg id="424">  </seg>
<seg id="425"> What a bastard! </seg>
<seg id="425">  </seg>
<seg id="426"> They do not have Red Bull without sugar. Only normal or G.O. juice unsweetened. </seg>
<seg id="426">  </seg>
<seg id="427"> - Cazzo, G.O. - Mr.O! </seg>
<seg id="427">  </seg>
<seg id="428"> Where the fuck are the keys? Ah, here it is. </seg>
<seg id="428">  </seg>
<seg id="429"> That bastards! I did not wanna wake you. </seg>
<seg id="429">  </seg>
<seg id="430"> You have nothing to do with it. That jerk hit my foot as it passed. </seg>
<seg id="430">  </seg>
<seg id="431"> I do not know, it made me shiver. </seg>
<seg id="431">  </seg>
<seg id="432"> Prick. </seg>
<seg id="432">  </seg>
<seg id="433"> Sure. </seg>
<seg id="433">  </seg>
<seg id="434"> Since I'm awake, I take some money at the ATM and make a nice cigarette. </seg>
<seg id="434">  </seg>
<seg id="435"> - Fuck you? - You saw that ... - What? Nothing honey. </seg>
<seg id="435">  </seg>
<seg id="436"> - Ready? - It's me! - Are you missing out? </seg>
<seg id="436">  </seg>
<seg id="437"> It's better to take your butt off Kim's car. </seg>
<seg id="437">  </seg>
<seg id="438"> - She too sat down before that. - His butts are not yours. </seg>
<seg id="438">  </seg>
<seg id="439"> All right. </seg>
<seg id="439">  </seg>
<seg id="440"> I should be on the number this month of Allure. </seg>
<seg id="440">  </seg>
<seg id="441"> - Do you have Allure? - The magazines near the window. </seg>
<seg id="441">  </seg>
<seg id="442"> Here you are! </seg>
<seg id="442">  </seg>
<seg id="443"> You're a real bastard. </seg>
<seg id="443">  </seg>
<seg id="444"> Arrive right away. </seg>
<seg id="444">  </seg>
<seg id="445"> And they are 16 and 15 of the rest. Thank you and goodbye. </seg>
<seg id="445">  </seg>
<seg id="446"> I have other fashion magazines for sale in the back. </seg>
<seg id="446">  </seg>
<seg id="447"> No, I'm not interested. That's enough. </seg>
<seg id="447">  </seg>
<seg id="448"> - Just for information. - Thanks anyway. - Good day. </seg>
<seg id="448">  </seg>
<seg id="449"> Look behind that I also have Italian Vogue. </seg>
<seg id="449">  </seg>
<seg id="450"> Of this month? </seg>
<seg id="450">  </seg>
<seg id="451"> This is what I have to tell. </seg>
<seg id="451">  </seg>
<seg id="452"> The Circle A boy has the number of this month's Italian Vogue. </seg>
<seg id="452">  </seg>
<seg id="453"> - I can not believe! - Strange but true. </seg>
<seg id="453">  </seg>
<seg id="454"> How could they have it? </seg>
<seg id="454">  </seg>
<seg id="455"> In fact they do not have it. Sell ​​his personal copy. </seg>
<seg id="455">  </seg>
<seg id="456"> - It's worth $ 27. - $ 27? </seg>
<seg id="456">  </seg>
<seg id="457"> What are your problems? It's like our shit shit. </seg>
<seg id="457">  </seg>
<seg id="458"> I found a number of Italian Vogue in Lebanon, Tennesse, and he does not ask Krugerrand to pay for it. I take it and divide it into three parts. </seg>
<seg id="458">  </seg>
<seg id="459"> - I, you and Kim? - No, Kim does not give a fuck to Italian Vogue. </seg>
<seg id="459">  </seg>
<seg id="460"> But Brandy will participate. And if not you, Tyson, the assistant. </seg>
<seg id="460">  </seg>
<seg id="461"> Okay, but if someone rips one of the pages I want, I do the color photocopies, and not in any copier, take her to the scenery department and the photocopies for good. </seg>
<seg id="461">  </seg>
<seg id="462"> I do the trick to Lindsey Lohan and she will miss for three days. For now there are no scenes with stunts, so Kim is free, and Lee is available for the next four days. </seg>
<seg id="462">  </seg>
<seg id="463"> - And how did they go? - Great big. </seg>
<seg id="463">  </seg>
<seg id="464"> We have a lot of fun. The director, Cecil Evans, is very sympathetic. </seg>
<seg id="464">  </seg>
<seg id="465"> - The movie is really cool and there are parties every night. - Sure. </seg>
<seg id="465">  </seg>
<seg id="466"> It is true, they will surely hunt down the job after this. </seg>
<seg id="466">  </seg>
<seg id="467"> Then, ladies, we talk about adventures. Who does stuff? </seg>
<seg id="467">  </seg>
<seg id="468"> - I'll talk about Lee and Tool. - Eh? - Oh, tool! </seg>
<seg id="468">  </seg>
<seg id="469"> - The name promises good. - It's a gunner! </seg>
<seg id="469">  </seg>
<seg id="470"> - It's really a pervert. - It's getting more and more interesting. </seg>
<seg id="470">  </seg>
<seg id="471"> What is its perversion? </seg>
<seg id="471">  </seg>
<seg id="472"> Look at me as I do the pipÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="472">  </seg>
<seg id="473"> Lee goes to the cup and Tool looks at her pissing. </seg>
<seg id="473">  </seg>
<seg id="474"> Tiky. Tiky. Tiky. You! </seg>
<seg id="474">  </seg>
<seg id="475"> Yeah, but now no more. Now she's doing it with The Rock. </seg>
<seg id="475">  </seg>
<seg id="476"> Are you fuckin 'The Rock ?! Not really The Rock, an electrician named Bruce. </seg>
<seg id="476">  </seg>
<seg id="477"> Kim calls it The Rock because it looks like The Rock and now we all call it The Rock. - It's a pseudo-star crew. </seg>
<seg id="477">  </seg>
<seg id="478"> There is one equal to Nicolas Cage and one that resembles Pee-Wee Herman. </seg>
<seg id="478">  </seg>
<seg id="479"> Kim, the cockpit department how are you? </seg>
<seg id="479">  </seg>
<seg id="480"> No cocks this round. Now I have a companion. </seg>
<seg id="480">  </seg>
<seg id="481"> - How long have you got this companion? Almost 3 months. </seg>
<seg id="481">  </seg>
<seg id="482"> - To whom did you frighten him? - I did not rub it! - Kim! - Well? Everyone knows they had a girlfriend. </seg>
<seg id="482">  </seg>
<seg id="483"> Nothing new, all Kim's boys are the boys of another. </seg>
<seg id="483">  </seg>
<seg id="484"> Girls, I did not rub it. And I have never frustrated anyone, they are they disappearing! </seg>
<seg id="484">  </seg>
<seg id="485"> And what about your hands, Abernathy? </seg>
<seg id="485">  </seg>
<seg id="486"> Abbie has the big Kahuna in her hands. </seg>
<seg id="486">  </seg>
<seg id="487"> - I had a cook for Cecil on the set. - Cotta on the set? But please! On the set you were like his wife. </seg>
<seg id="487">  </seg>
<seg id="488"> "I had" and "were" the keywords. </seg>
<seg id="488">  </seg>
<seg id="489"> You are still both taken, do not bury. </seg>
<seg id="489">  </seg>
<seg id="490"> If she is so in love with me, why does she shoot Daryl Hannah's counterpart? </seg>
<seg id="490">  </seg>
<seg id="491"> Yeah, men are bitches. Is not that fun? </seg>
<seg id="491">  </seg>
<seg id="492"> - ÃƒÃ † cosÃƒÂ¬ fun! - Do not do what's wrong with us. - You're just fucking your ass. - It's just a fucking counterpart. </seg>
<seg id="492">  </seg>
<seg id="493"> Beautiful, you have to overcome this shit. It was 2 weeks ago. </seg>
<seg id="493">  </seg>
<seg id="494"> Sure, if you put it this way ... </seg>
<seg id="494">  </seg>
<seg id="495"> I did not tell you the best part: If it's fucked up at my birthday. </seg>
<seg id="495">  </seg>
<seg id="496"> - Then this changes things. - Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="496">  </seg>
<seg id="497"> Did you know it was your party? The directors are always so busy. </seg>
<seg id="497">  </seg>
<seg id="498"> He ate a slice of my birthday cake and brought me a present. Yeah, I'd say he knew that. - Cabbage! What gift did you do? </seg>
<seg id="498">  </seg>
<seg id="499"> He made me a cassette. </seg>
<seg id="499">  </seg>
<seg id="500"> - Did you make a cassette? - SÃƒÂ¬. - Ah! </seg>
<seg id="500">  </seg>
<seg id="501"> - You did not burn a CD, did you make a cassette? - SÃƒÂ¬. - What a romantic thing! - I know what you're saying, so it's useless to find out. - For me it's a great demonstration of love. </seg>
<seg id="501">  </seg>
<seg id="502"> Feel it, I know you like it. Yeah, it's cool. But she's fucked another woman on my birthday. </seg>
<seg id="502">  </seg>
<seg id="503"> How do you not stay on my side? </seg>
<seg id="503">  </seg>
<seg id="504"> - That's right, it looks like a bad thing. - It's a shit! </seg>
<seg id="504">  </seg>
<seg id="505"> But below is there any other reason? </seg>
<seg id="505">  </seg>
<seg id="506"> - You two fucked? - Of course not. </seg>
<seg id="506">  </seg>
<seg id="507"> - Sorry, you call Abernathy? - Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="507">  </seg>
<seg id="508"> The answer to your question is: No, of course not. </seg>
<seg id="508">  </seg>
<seg id="509"> What does "No, of course not" mean? </seg>
<seg id="509">  </seg>
<seg id="510"> The reason why Cecil does not have a fixed girl for six years is because the girls are fucked. And if you are Cecil, do not become one of her girls. </seg>
<seg id="510">  </seg>
<seg id="511"> I do not say why I want to be her girlfriend, but if I wanted to be and I was fucked up, now I would not be her girlfriend, I would be one of her stories. </seg>
<seg id="511">  </seg>
<seg id="512"> And I'm getting a bit old for shit. </seg>
<seg id="512">  </seg>
<seg id="513"> - You did not do anything at all? - Of course he does. </seg>
<seg id="513">  </seg>
<seg id="514"> I made a foot massage and when we went to the movie, I let him hold his hand on his knees. </seg>
<seg id="514">  </seg>
<seg id="515"> Bella, you behave like a twelve-year-old, he's acting like a man. Let it smell at least! </seg>
<seg id="515">  </seg>
<seg id="516"> - Let's say things like they are: You do not aim for it. - No. - Do not blow it. - No. - You do not even hear him. - No. But the counterpart of Daryl Hannah does. Can we close the discussion on my sexual life? </seg>
<seg id="516">  </seg>
<seg id="517"> Truly the discussion was about Cecil's sex life, your treasure is nonexistent. </seg>
<seg id="517">  </seg>
<seg id="518"> I cry to both of you and your humor. </seg>
<seg id="518">  </seg>
<seg id="519"> Before claiming a big dick, darling, you have to deserve it, the dick. You can start by making a nice saw in his trailer bag Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="519">  </seg>
<seg id="520"> - They will not! - I know you will not do it, but you know who will do it? </seg>
<seg id="520">  </seg>
<seg id="521"> The whore who will eventually live with him in his huge villa. </seg>
<seg id="521">  </seg>
<seg id="522"> Feel, I'm not entirely in agreement with Kim, but it's also true that if you've kept it like you say with Cecil and suddenly you start to bite, you blow your brain! </seg>
<seg id="522">  </seg>
<seg id="523"> Zoe, Kim and I were in the Philippines at a rave outdoors. </seg>
<seg id="523">  </seg>
<seg id="524"> - What movie? - "Three Heads in Head # 3". </seg>
<seg id="524">  </seg>
<seg id="525"> To put it all, we were all three lost. - SÃƒÂ¬! </seg>
<seg id="525">  </seg>
<seg id="526"> - Go. - Let's go. </seg>
<seg id="526">  </seg>
<seg id="527"> Health. </seg>
<seg id="527">  </seg>
<seg id="528"> Then, Zoe, the genius comes up to take a picture of me. </seg>
<seg id="528">  </seg>
<seg id="529"> You do not see a fuck, it's dark to die. </seg>
<seg id="529">  </seg>
<seg id="530"> She is with the car in her hand and says: "Go a little further." And I'm going. Then: "Another little." And I'll go back a bit. Then: "Another little." And I'm moving. </seg>
<seg id="530">  </seg>
<seg id="531"> I realize I'm on the edge of a 2-meter-high concrete ditch, with inside a mountain of shit, stones, broken bottles, and giant mice. And if I was in that suck, I could break the bone of my neck. </seg>
<seg id="531">  </seg>
<seg id="532"> Then I start shouting: "Zoe, fuck, you just did not kill me!" </seg>
<seg id="532">  </seg>
<seg id="533"> We start laughing like crazy, we walk a little bit and Zoe starts to crawl and disappears. Do you know where it was going? Within that fucking ditch. </seg>
<seg id="533">  </seg>
<seg id="534"> - Good good. - Thank you, thank you very much. </seg>
<seg id="534">  </seg>
<seg id="535"> I remember taking a step and looking down and meanwhile, I thought, "This is the ditch that Abbie said." - Yeah! I'm plunged in. - And what did he do? </seg>
<seg id="535">  </seg>
<seg id="536"> Are you talking about Zoe, the cat? Anything. </seg>
<seg id="536">  </seg>
<seg id="537"> If I fell down, they would pull me out with a teaspoon. </seg>
<seg id="537">  </seg>
<seg id="538"> Zoe fell perfectly to his feet. </seg>
<seg id="538">  </seg>
<seg id="539"> But then I reflected on me and I was a little depressed. </seg>
<seg id="539">  </seg>
<seg id="540"> Zoe ends up in that ditch and nothing is done. </seg>
<seg id="540">  </seg>
<seg id="541"> In fact, we laugh over it. </seg>
<seg id="541">  </seg>
<seg id="542"> If I was finished I would be paralyzed. </seg>
<seg id="542">  </seg>
<seg id="543"> You can not reason like that. </seg>
<seg id="543">  </seg>
<seg id="544"> Each of us owns his talent, that's Zoe's talent. </seg>
<seg id="544">  </seg>
<seg id="545"> Of course. If we talk about physics, Zoe is great. Agility, reflexes, looseness ... </seg>
<seg id="545">  </seg>
<seg id="546"> - Few human beings flip Zoe on that forehead. - Kim, I love you! </seg>
<seg id="546">  </seg>
<seg id="547"> That said, before you become too envious of Zoe's ability, you did not understand the most important part of the story. </seg>
<seg id="547">  </seg>
<seg id="548"> You did not fall into the moat. Zoe sÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="548">  </seg>
<seg id="549"> Zoe even knew that there was a ditch because you told him, and the same thing fell. </seg>
<seg id="549">  </seg>
<seg id="550"> So Lee is right: We all have a lot of talent. - Why does not it look like a compliment? </seg>
<seg id="550">  </seg>
<seg id="551"> Kim, do you always have Roscoe? </seg>
<seg id="551">  </seg>
<seg id="552"> - Look here, slut. - Oh! I love it. - Me too. </seg>
<seg id="552">  </seg>
<seg id="553"> - Fuck is Roscoe? - The Roscoe is a gun. </seg>
<seg id="553">  </seg>
<seg id="554"> - Do you have a gun? - Ah-ah. </seg>
<seg id="554">  </seg>
<seg id="555"> - And you have permission to have it? - SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="555">  </seg>
<seg id="556"> When I was a secret service agent I was given one. </seg>
<seg id="556">  </seg>
<seg id="557"> I did not know you were ... </seg>
<seg id="557">  </seg>
<seg id="558"> Okay, I did not tell you, okay? Just look at me, I did not say it. God! </seg>
<seg id="558">  </seg>
<seg id="559"> - Did you know he had it? - SÃƒÂ¬. Do you want to know if I agree? No. </seg>
<seg id="559">  </seg>
<seg id="560"> Did I know that? SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="560">  </seg>
<seg id="561"> I do not know in what futuristic utopia you live, but in the world in which I live this bullshit serves. </seg>
<seg id="561">  </seg>
<seg id="562"> But you can not deny that today who has a gun tends to be killed far more than anyone who does not have it. </seg>
<seg id="562">  </seg>
<seg id="563"> And you can not deny that, as I often go to my laundry room at midnight, I can risk my ass! </seg>
<seg id="563">  </seg>
<seg id="564"> - Why do not you try to do it before? 'Fuck! I do the laundry when my dick goes to laundry. </seg>
<seg id="564">  </seg>
<seg id="565"> There are other things you can use instead of a gun: pepper spray. </seg>
<seg id="565">  </seg>
<seg id="566"> If an asshole tries to violate me, I do not want to irritate the skin. </seg>
<seg id="566">  </seg>
<seg id="567"> I want to kill him! </seg>
<seg id="567">  </seg>
<seg id="568"> Why do not you bring a knife? </seg>
<seg id="568">  </seg>
<seg id="569"> Do you know what happens to knives with the knife? </seg>
<seg id="569">  </seg>
<seg id="570"> They fired at him. </seg>
<seg id="570">  </seg>
<seg id="571"> Look, if one day they're going to become a famous actress, they will not take the gun. </seg>
<seg id="571">  </seg>
<seg id="572"> I'll pay a niggard for a gang and bring him the iron. </seg>
<seg id="572">  </seg>
<seg id="573"> If anything happens, I'll be watching, but until then I'm in war. </seg>
<seg id="573">  </seg>
<seg id="574"> So, Zoe, did you think what you want to do? </seg>
<seg id="574">  </seg>
<seg id="575"> Yeah, girls, I know exactly. </seg>
<seg id="575">  </seg>
<seg id="576"> Really? And what the fuck do you want to do? </seg>
<seg id="576">  </seg>
<seg id="577"> It would not make sense for me to stay in America without driving a muscle car. </seg>
<seg id="577">  </seg>
<seg id="578"> I want to drive a Dodge Challenger, enjoy the way and go to the ball! </seg>
<seg id="578">  </seg>
<seg id="579"> We can ask the car department of the movie. - Must a Dodge Challenger work? - And that's not enough. </seg>
<seg id="579">  </seg>
<seg id="580"> It must be a 70's Dodge Challenger with 440 engine. </seg>
<seg id="580">  </seg>
<seg id="581"> And how dare you do that? </seg>
<seg id="581">  </seg>
<seg id="582"> Quiet, beauty, I've arranged everything. </seg>
<seg id="582">  </seg>
<seg id="583"> When I decided to come, I went online and found out that the local newspaper here in Tennesse is the Lebanon News Sentinel. </seg>
<seg id="583">  </seg>
<seg id="584"> And at my home ... - Sorry, where do you live? Australian? </seg>
<seg id="584">  </seg>
<seg id="585"> - What do you mean by that? - Zoe is a New Zealander. You never have to, never say, give a Australian Kiwi. </seg>
<seg id="585">  </seg>
<seg id="586"> Unless you want to take a lot of wood. </seg>
<seg id="586">  </seg>
<seg id="587"> I did not know, I'm sorry ... </seg>
<seg id="587">  </seg>
<seg id="588"> Be quiet, we're just taking your ass. </seg>
<seg id="588">  </seg>
<seg id="589"> Auckland, to answer your question. </seg>
<seg id="589">  </seg>
<seg id="590"> Anyway, I subscribed to the newspaper a month ago. </seg>
<seg id="590">  </seg>
<seg id="591"> But why? What do you need a cafe magazine in New Zealand? </seg>
<seg id="591">  </seg>
<seg id="592"> If you close that mouthpiece, I try to tell you. </seg>
<seg id="592">  </seg>
<seg id="593"> I read the newspaper all month and checked ads looking for machines for sale. </seg>
<seg id="593">  </seg>
<seg id="594"> So just yesterday, right here in this city, there is one willing to sell a Dodge Challenger in the 1970s with a 440 engine painted in white. </seg>
<seg id="594">  </seg>
<seg id="595"> And how the fuck do you buy it? </seg>
<seg id="595">  </seg>
<seg id="596"> Maybe I'm stupid, but I'm not yet reincarnated. </seg>
<seg id="596">  </seg>
<seg id="597"> I mean that maybe I buy it, so it makes me a test drive. </seg>
<seg id="597">  </seg>
<seg id="598"> What reminds you of a white 70's Dodge Challenger? </seg>
<seg id="598">  </seg>
<seg id="599"> - Kowalski! - "Punto Zero" Kowalski, slut slut! </seg>
<seg id="599">  </seg>
<seg id="600"> That movie is a classic. If I get that asshole to drive me alone, with the open doors I fly that bastard! </seg>
<seg id="600">  </seg>
<seg id="601"> What's "Zero Point"? How, what's Zero Point? </seg>
<seg id="601">  </seg>
<seg id="602"> Abbie, I always do the part of the ignorant. </seg>
<seg id="602">  </seg>
<seg id="603"> It is one of the best American movies of all time! </seg>
<seg id="603">  </seg>
<seg id="604"> Truly, Zoe, many girls do not know "Zero Point". </seg>
<seg id="604">  </seg>
<seg id="605"> Sorry, did you tell many girls? And what the fuck would you be? </seg>
<seg id="605">  </seg>
<seg id="606"> Yeah, but we're car fanatics, so we saw it. </seg>
<seg id="606">  </seg>
<seg id="607"> You grew up looking at "Beautiful in pink." </seg>
<seg id="607">  </seg>
<seg id="608"> - I like "Belle in pink". </seg>
<seg id="608">  </seg>
<seg id="609"> - Here you see? Why did not you look at John Hughes's movies? </seg>
<seg id="609">  </seg>
<seg id="610"> I was looking at them. I'm a female, me. </seg>
<seg id="610">  </seg>
<seg id="611"> But I also looked at all those on the engines. </seg>
<seg id="611">  </seg>
<seg id="612"> "Zero Point", "Zozza Mary, Crazy Gary," "Out in 60 Seconds." </seg>
<seg id="612">  </seg>
<seg id="613"> The true one. Not that shit that Angelina Jolie did. </seg>
<seg id="613">  </seg>
<seg id="614"> In Auckland there is an open-air cinema that makes "Punto Zero", "A Merry Christmas", in short all the classics. It's a shame! </seg>
<seg id="614">  </seg>
<seg id="615"> What the fuck do you play? What do you want? Is she selling a 70's Dodge Challenger? </seg>
<seg id="615">  </seg>
<seg id="616"> For this, princesses. </seg>
<seg id="616">  </seg>
<seg id="617"> Fuck this, it's an absolute hack! </seg>
<seg id="617">  </seg>
<seg id="618"> Mythical, absolutely mythical! </seg>
<seg id="618">  </seg>
<seg id="619"> It's a real fairy tale. I apologize only for a moment, I would like to speak privately with my members. </seg>
<seg id="619">  </seg>
<seg id="620"> Take it easy, ladies. </seg>
<seg id="620">  </seg>
<seg id="621"> What are you waiting for? Ask him if he is driving you. - Now I'm talking to you, but first I have to ask you something. - Thing? </seg>
<seg id="621">  </seg>
<seg id="622"> If he lets us take the sun, I want to rethink the Ship's Mast. - Fuck, no! - Lower your voice! </seg>
<seg id="622">  </seg>
<seg id="623"> Forgive me for Ship's Mast. </seg>
<seg id="623">  </seg>
<seg id="624"> - Jesus Christ! - Do not blaspheme. - Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="624">  </seg>
<seg id="625"> So, what did you say last time? </seg>
<seg id="625">  </seg>
<seg id="626"> - I know what I said. - What did you say? </seg>
<seg id="626">  </seg>
<seg id="627"> - We did not have to do it anymore. - No, you did not say "we did not have to." </seg>
<seg id="627">  </seg>
<seg id="628"> You said, "We will never do it anymore." - SÃƒÂ¬, ma. - "But," a fuck, Zoe. </seg>
<seg id="628">  </seg>
<seg id="629"> You said that we would never have done that fucking game and that if I had tried to do what you wanted to do, I had to refuse, and I also had permission to physically prevent you from doing so, did you understand? Did you say it or did not you tell her? </seg>
<seg id="629">  </seg>
<seg id="630"> - Ma. - No, no. Reply, ugly bitch! </seg>
<seg id="630">  </seg>
<seg id="631"> - Did you say it or did not you tell her? - Yeah, I told you. Anyway ... I cry for you and "anyway". </seg>
<seg id="631">  </seg>
<seg id="632"> Okay, I know I said that and I know I was serious. </seg>
<seg id="632">  </seg>
<seg id="633"> - Yeah, you were serious. - Yeah, but I did not mean to do it in America. </seg>
<seg id="633">  </seg>
<seg id="634"> - But please! - Yeah, it's real, fuck. </seg>
<seg id="634">  </seg>
<seg id="635"> I meant we no longer had to do it in New Zealand or Australia. </seg>
<seg id="635">  </seg>
<seg id="636"> You're a big liar. </seg>
<seg id="636">  </seg>
<seg id="637"> Look, I know what I said and when I said it, but when I told her I did not know I would come here. </seg>
<seg id="637">  </seg>
<seg id="638"> And if I knew I'd come to America and be able to play Ship's Mast on a Challenger dick at the "Zero Point", I would definitely have added a "anyway." I got it? </seg>
<seg id="638">  </seg>
<seg id="639"> Okay, you will look strange, but I really understand. </seg>
<seg id="639">  </seg>
<seg id="640"> Anyway, just because you're convinced of these stupid bitches, does not mean I've drunk my brain. </seg>
<seg id="640">  </seg>
<seg id="641"> - They need two people for that fucking game and I refuse. - Ah. </seg>
<seg id="641">  </seg>
<seg id="642"> It will be your friend of heart. </seg>
<seg id="642">  </seg>
<seg id="643"> I do not need you if you're on the other side of the planet. </seg>
<seg id="643">  </seg>
<seg id="644"> - Do I scratch your back? - You would still cut me off. </seg>
<seg id="644">  </seg>
<seg id="645"> Yeah, but I got another thing in mind. </seg>
<seg id="645">  </seg>
<seg id="646"> From now on, as long as you are here, your slave-back-slave will be yours. </seg>
<seg id="646">  </seg>
<seg id="647"> You will do it whenever you want, you do not even have to ask me. </seg>
<seg id="647">  </seg>
<seg id="648"> You'll get me the order, you say, "Nice to do." </seg>
<seg id="648">  </seg>
<seg id="649"> You kick my back, you massage my feet and after the shower put me the moisturizer on the buttocks. I'm in. </seg>
<seg id="649">  </seg>
<seg id="650"> Let's see if the monster lets us try the car without him. </seg>
<seg id="650">  </seg>
<seg id="651"> If you leave her, you wait here, we'll be back soon. </seg>
<seg id="651">  </seg>
<seg id="652"> Thing? </seg>
<seg id="652">  </seg>
<seg id="653"> - I said: If the monster lets us try. - I heard what you said. Only I can not believe what you said. </seg>
<seg id="653">  </seg>
<seg id="654"> - You both have a face. - Why? </seg>
<seg id="654">  </seg>
<seg id="655"> Do not be fooled with me. I was awake all night, I'm still a bit drunk and I have a headache. </seg>
<seg id="655">  </seg>
<seg id="656"> I should be in the hotel to sleep, not crawling on the Tobacco Way, but as Zoe wants to drive a dick car from "Punto Zero", I'm here. </seg>
<seg id="656">  </seg>
<seg id="657"> And you have an ass to ask me, no, delete the last one, tell me that I have to make a conversation with Tom Joad while the jokes go to play? I cry, I do not listen to you. </seg>
<seg id="657">  </seg>
<seg id="658"> - It's not so. - So how is it, Kim? - We must leave you as a guarantee. </seg>
<seg id="658">  </seg>
<seg id="659"> The monster will never accept it if we leave it all away. </seg>
<seg id="659">  </seg>
<seg id="660"> I believe that only one pledge pledges as a guarantee. </seg>
<seg id="660">  </seg>
<seg id="661"> - You do not like what we want to do. - Drive a car? </seg>
<seg id="661">  </seg>
<seg id="662"> - This is something more. - CioÃ¨? Are you going fast? </seg>
<seg id="662">  </seg>
<seg id="663"> - Something more. - If you did not understand, we're doing a great favor, because we're doing a shit. But we're stunted, we do not have good sense. </seg>
<seg id="663">  </seg>
<seg id="664"> But you have good sense and anyone who has good sense will not do what we will do. </seg>
<seg id="664">  </seg>
<seg id="665"> - Who tells you I do not want to do that? - Abbie, you're a mom. - SÃƒÂ¬. </seg>
<seg id="665">  </seg>
<seg id="666"> We should be a mythical posse, but this is the excuse you use whenever you want to exclude me from something. </seg>
<seg id="666">  </seg>
<seg id="667"> What are you dreadful about doing and that I'm so little I'm not even able to understand? </seg>
<seg id="667">  </seg>
<seg id="668"> Look, since we try to rub the monster, it would be better not to go into the details while watching us. </seg>
<seg id="668">  </seg>
<seg id="669"> And then, darling, surely they will not let us. </seg>
<seg id="669">  </seg>
<seg id="670"> Okay, feel if you like it. </seg>
<seg id="670">  </seg>
<seg id="671"> I will convince him. But if I can, I come with you. </seg>
<seg id="671">  </seg>
<seg id="672"> - And how do you think they do? - This is my problem. </seg>
<seg id="672">  </seg>
<seg id="673"> But be sure the monster will say yes. </seg>
<seg id="673">  </seg>
<seg id="674"> How are you going to do it, a superpump? </seg>
<seg id="674">  </seg>
<seg id="675"> No! </seg>
<seg id="675">  </seg>
<seg id="676"> I'll tell Lee Lee will do a blowjob. </seg>
<seg id="676">  </seg>
<seg id="677"> - How does he do it? - It's not great, but let me do it. So, did you buy it? </seg>
<seg id="677">  </seg>
<seg id="678"> Okay, mama, listen. </seg>
<seg id="678">  </seg>
<seg id="679"> Do you want to skip it with the straights? Then you have to act like a pussy. </seg>
<seg id="679">  </seg>
<seg id="680"> If you come with us, you will not say "fuck" and "shit". </seg>
<seg id="680">  </seg>
<seg id="681"> - You sit back and I do not want to hear a breath, you know? - Clear. </seg>
<seg id="681">  </seg>
<seg id="682"> If you complain, we stop in the middle of the street, kick your ass and take you back. - Agree. </seg>
<seg id="682">  </seg>
<seg id="683"> Okay, do your magic. </seg>
<seg id="683">  </seg>
<seg id="684"> - Hello Sir. - Hello. - What's your name? - Jasper. </seg>
<seg id="684">  </seg>
<seg id="685"> - Hi, Jasper, I'm Abernathy. - Aber what? - Abernathy. </seg>
<seg id="685">  </seg>
<seg id="686"> - And how do you name it? - This is my name. </seg>
<seg id="686">  </seg>
<seg id="687"> - What the fuck is your name? - Call me Abbie too. - Okay, Abbie. </seg>
<seg id="687">  </seg>
<seg id="688"> Jasper, me and my friends would like to know if we can take the car for a test ride to see if we really like it. </seg>
<seg id="688">  </seg>
<seg id="689"> - Why should I do this shit? - To sell his car better. </seg>
<seg id="689">  </seg>
<seg id="690"> How do I know that you do not fuck her? </seg>
<seg id="690">  </seg>
<seg id="691"> For four reasons, Jasper. One: We're not thieves, two: Doing so would be rude, three: We're staying at the Days Inn in the city. </seg>
<seg id="691">  </seg>
<seg id="692"> Call the hotel, ask for directions. We booked throughout the month. </seg>
<seg id="692">  </seg>
<seg id="693"> In fact, Zoe no, but Kim and I do, so we can absolutely be traced. </seg>
<seg id="693">  </seg>
<seg id="694"> - Who is Kim, the Negro? - Yeah, Kim would be the color girl. </seg>
<seg id="694">  </seg>
<seg id="695"> Reason number four, which is the most important: As we take the car for a ride, she will have the great opportunity to do a thorough acquaintance with our friend Lee. </seg>
<seg id="695">  </seg>
<seg id="696"> I seem to have seen it. </seg>
<seg id="696">  </seg>
<seg id="697"> - She thinks she has seen her because she's a famous actress. - Ah! </seg>
<seg id="697">  </seg>
<seg id="698"> - Why is it so tanned? - We're shooting in a Hollywood movie, and it's a cheerleader movie and she's one of the cheerleaders. </seg>
<seg id="698">  </seg>
<seg id="699"> - A cheerleader movie? - A movie about cheerleaders. </seg>
<seg id="699">  </seg>
<seg id="700"> - But what is a porn? - Yeah, right. </seg>
<seg id="700">  </seg>
<seg id="701"> - But do not talk to her, she's very timid. - Timid? </seg>
<seg id="701">  </seg>
<seg id="702"> Lee, he's Jasper. Jasper, Lee. </seg>
<seg id="702">  </seg>
<seg id="703"> I recommend, kids, do not bother. </seg>
<seg id="703">  </seg>
<seg id="704"> See you, splendor. We come to take you later. </seg>
<seg id="704">  </seg>
<seg id="705"> Hi, Treasures. Do good. </seg>
<seg id="705">  </seg>
<seg id="706"> Gulp. </seg>
<seg id="706">  </seg>
<seg id="707"> Do you think what I think? </seg>
<seg id="707">  </seg>
<seg id="708"> - Yeah, I think so. - What are you thinking about? </seg>
<seg id="708">  </seg>
<seg id="709"> I'm thinking we told you to close that cock of mouth. </seg>
<seg id="709">  </seg>
<seg id="710"> - Where are you going now? - Do not move. - I run to piss. </seg>
<seg id="710">  </seg>
<seg id="711"> So, do you feel ready? </seg>
<seg id="711">  </seg>
<seg id="712"> - Safety? - I always do not want to do it before I do. </seg>
<seg id="712">  </seg>
<seg id="713"> - I do not know if you understand. - Of course I understand, because I do not want to do it. </seg>
<seg id="713">  </seg>
<seg id="714"> - Kim! - I'm just talking. </seg>
<seg id="714">  </seg>
<seg id="715"> - If you take away all the fun ... - I'm just talking. </seg>
<seg id="715">  </seg>
<seg id="716"> Do you want to start from above? </seg>
<seg id="716">  </seg>
<seg id="717"> But surely I start from above, I can not enjoy myself. </seg>
<seg id="717">  </seg>
<seg id="718"> Take. </seg>
<seg id="718">  </seg>
<seg id="719"> - No, no, I put it, the jacket. - But the jacket is mine. Look! </seg>
<seg id="719">  </seg>
<seg id="720"> No. The chances are you made me my slave. </seg>
<seg id="720">  </seg>
<seg id="721"> - Give it to me. - I'm going out on that cock fuck. Roof a dick! You're on the bonnet. </seg>
<seg id="721">  </seg>
<seg id="722"> Girls, a car is coming. - Give me the belt. - Oh! </seg>
<seg id="722">  </seg>
<seg id="723"> - But this is my favorite. - Fuck! </seg>
<seg id="723">  </seg>
<seg id="724"> - Fuck you, take that of Abernathy. - But ... Okay, we'll use his. </seg>
<seg id="724">  </seg>
<seg id="725"> - Belt, force. - No. ÃƒÃ † Prada. - Do not do the bitch, come on. - Magic words. </seg>
<seg id="725">  </seg>
<seg id="726"> - Please, out of my belt. - Just because you were pretty. </seg>
<seg id="726">  </seg>
<seg id="727"> - It's cute to be nice, Kim. - Brava. </seg>
<seg id="727">  </seg>
<seg id="728"> Do you know what? Do not even ask me the next time you get your hair. </seg>
<seg id="728">  </seg>
<seg id="729"> So do me the same. </seg>
<seg id="729">  </seg>
<seg id="730"> Why do you ask me when nobody sees you. </seg>
<seg id="730">  </seg>
<seg id="731"> You're not that bad. I do not give you some shit. </seg>
<seg id="731">  </seg>
<seg id="732"> Abernathy, now do not break the balls. I have other things for the mind. </seg>
<seg id="732">  </seg>
<seg id="733"> - How scary! - Look, I'm not six. </seg>
<seg id="733">  </seg>
<seg id="734"> - Do you mind, raise the windows? - No. </seg>
<seg id="734">  </seg>
<seg id="735"> Now, Abernathy, look what I do. </seg>
<seg id="735">  </seg>
<seg id="736"> It's out of the window! What the fuck do you do ?! </seg>
<seg id="736">  </seg>
<seg id="737"> Wow! </seg>
<seg id="737">  </seg>
<seg id="738"> Push that fucking pedal! Get gas! What if that's enough for that dry ass! </seg>
<seg id="738">  </seg>
<seg id="739"> Abernathy, move your front legs. </seg>
<seg id="739">  </seg>
<seg id="740"> All right. </seg>
<seg id="740">  </seg>
<seg id="741"> Oooh ... </seg>
<seg id="741">  </seg>
<seg id="742"> Let's see now, bitch, we run even more. </seg>
<seg id="742">  </seg>
<seg id="743"> - OMG! - What the hell is that? </seg>
<seg id="743">  </seg>
<seg id="744"> Fuck! </seg>
<seg id="744">  </seg>
<seg id="745"> Now! </seg>
<seg id="745">  </seg>
