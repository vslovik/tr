<seg id="1"> Hold on. I gotta come up. </seg>
<seg id="2"> I gotta take the world's biggest fucking piss. </seg>
<seg id="3"> We can't be late. We won't! </seg>
<seg id="4"> - Who's holding? - lf you're not then nobody. </seg>
<seg id="5"> We were kind of hoping you were. - Yeah. How are you not holding? - Jesus Christ Shanna. It is not my fucking job to supply y'all with weed when we go out. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Whoa whoa whoa whoa little lady. </seg>
<seg id="7"> You're getting angry kind of quick don't you think? </seg>
<seg id="8"> - l was just teasing you. - l'm not angry. It just would be nice if y'all didn't just count on me all the fucking time and surprise me every once in a while with pot. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Okay mean girl in a high school movie. Are you through having a tantrum? - l'm not having a tantrum. - Yes you are. </seg>
<seg id="10"> You've been in the car all of two seconds and you're already cursing at me. </seg>
<seg id="11"> - l am not cursing at you. - You said "Jesus Christ Shanna." </seg>
<seg id="12"> And then before the sentence was over you threw a "fucking" in there to emphasize your "irritatance." All right. Come on guys. Don't fight. I'll pay for it when we get some. </seg>
<seg id="13"> One: It is not about the money. It is about the pain in the ass of scoring. And two: We're not really fighting. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Arlene have you forgotten what hanging out with Jungle Julia's like? </seg>
<seg id="15"> That wasn't a fight. </seg>
<seg id="16"> That was Julia acting like a grumpy bitch and me calling her on it and indulging her at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="17"> That's how we tolerate each other after all these years. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Oh billboard. </seg>
<seg id="19"> So what's the plan man? Margaritas and Mexican food at Guero's. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Did you call Rafael and tell him we're coming? - Of course. </seg>
<seg id="21"> - You're so good. I know. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Okay is Christian Simonson gonna be there? </seg>
<seg id="23"> You bet your ass he is. He's gonna be there with Jesse Letterman. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Christian Simonson the filmmaker is in town. </seg>
<seg id="25"> He's got a big thing for Julia. If he had a big thing for me he'd fucking call me as opposed to disappearing for six months and he'd get his ass down here more often than he does and on my birthday give me a fucking phone call. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Oh billboard. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Yeah but you get those legs of yours around him and it's all over. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Yeah well when l'm redecorating his house in the hills that l am also living in I'll let you know it worked. </seg>
<seg id="29"> So margaritas and Mexican food at Guero's touch base with Chris and Jesse tell them about later and make damn sure they come. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Those other guys will be waiting for us to join them at the Texas Chili Parlor. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Oh shit. Speaking of which what happened with you and Nate last night? </seg>
<seg id="32"> Well you know not mu-- We just fucking met each other. </seg>
<seg id="33"> I mean if you don't bust their balls a little bit they're never gonna respect you. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Okay we're pretty clear on what it is you didn't do. </seg>
<seg id="35"> How about enlightening us on what it is you did do? </seg>
<seg id="36"> Nothing to write home about. </seg>
<seg id="37"> We just made out on the couch for about 20 minutes. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Dressed half-dressed or naked? </seg>
<seg id="39"> Dressed. I said we made out. We didn't do the thing. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Excuse me for living but what is "the thing"? </seg>
<seg id="41"> You know it's everything but. They call it "the thing"? </seg>
<seg id="42"> I call it "the thing." Do guys like the thing? </seg>
<seg id="43"> They like it better than no thing. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Okay l wanna get back to what it is you did do. </seg>
<seg id="45"> So you're making out on the couch with Nate right? - Correct. - Whose couch? - His or the one in your hotel room? - What am I stupid over here? Mine. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Were you making out sitting up or lying down? </seg>
<seg id="47"> We started sitting up. We worked our way to lying down. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Mmm the plot thickens. Who was on top? I was straddling him. </seg>
<seg id="49"> - What else? - That was it. So we made out for a little while on the couch and I said "Okay l'm gonna go to bed now so it's time for you to leave." </seg>
<seg id="50"> And then he starts to whine "Oh right now?" </seg>
<seg id="51"> And l said "Yep right now. Let's go." And he says "Well wait. What about this?" </seg>
<seg id="52"> And I said "No." He said "What do you mean no? You don't even know what l'm gonna say." </seg>
<seg id="53"> I said "l already know what you're gonna say and the answer's no." </seg>
<seg id="54"> He said "How can you say you know what I'm gonna say?" </seg>
<seg id="55"> I said "Because you're gonna say 'let's just go to sleep together. "'We don't gotta do nothing. "'Just cuddle sleep next to each other wake up in the morning together.' No you're gonna leave but I'll see you tomorrow." </seg>
<seg id="56"> Yeah fuck Nate. I mean he's cute and all </seg>
<seg id="57"> but Jesse Letterman's gonna be all over her. </seg>
<seg id="58"> - Jesse Letterman-- - Remember no hooking up tonight. </seg>
<seg id="59"> You can hang out with him you can make out with him but no hooking up with him because we are driving to Lake LBJ tonight and my daddy's pretty clear about one thing. </seg>
<seg id="60"> He said "l am letting you and your girlfriends stay at my lake house not you and a bunch of horny boys trying to get their fuck on with my daughter." </seg>
<seg id="61"> - Your dad talks like that? - Hell yeah! </seg>
<seg id="62"> It's not like he ain't gonna know either because when I'm staying at the lake house with my girlfriends in our bikinis Daddy just has a tendency to pop up and make sure we don't need anything. </seg>
<seg id="63"> Look he's totally harmless and cute as a bug's ear. </seg>
<seg id="64"> But you know when he's got a bunch of half-naked poontang walking the floor of his lake house he just likes to pay us a visit and make sure we got everything we need. </seg>
<seg id="65"> And if you flirt shamelessly with him like the six-foot baby giraffe in the backseat you got a puppy dog for life. </seg>
<seg id="66"> I have my own relationship with Ben and you're just jealous 'cause it don't include you. </seg>
<seg id="67"> - You call her dad Ben? - l'm not a child. That's his name. </seg>
<seg id="68"> So when are the boys showing up? They're gonna meet us at the Chili Parlor. </seg>
<seg id="69"> Maybe they can bring some pot. Fuck that. No. </seg>
<seg id="70"> I don't wanna be either A depending on their fucking ass or B depending on their ass. Uh-uh. We don't score ourselves we're gonna be stuck with them all fucking night. </seg>
<seg id="71"> Ooh try Lanna Frank. Best idea you had all day. </seg>
<seg id="72"> Oh hey that's your last billboard before Guero's. </seg>
<seg id="73"> Oh come on. Give me a break. </seg>
<seg id="74"> "Oh come on" my ass! We said every time. Okay. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Jules let me get a drag? Thanks. </seg>
<seg id="76"> - Hey. - Hey. </seg>
<seg id="77"> - You wanna join us? - For a second but l'm with some friends. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Oh. So you must be-- must be-- So you must be the infamous Butterfly. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Shh! She don't know nothing about it. </seg>
<seg id="80"> - Know about what? - When were y'all gonna tell her? </seg>
<seg id="81"> - Soon. - Tell me what? Yeah now thanks to you we gotta tell her sooner than later. </seg>
<seg id="82"> All right cut the shit. What the fuck is going on? </seg>
<seg id="83"> I said a little somethin'-somethin' about you on the air today. </seg>
<seg id="84"> Julia what the fuck did you say about me on the radio? </seg>
<seg id="85"> All I said was I had a sexy friend named Butterfly who was in from out of town for the weekend and we would be going out somewhere in Austin tonight and if they were out on the town maybe they'd see us. And l described you and I said that if they spotted you while we were out if they'd do something you'd do something. </seg>
<seg id="86"> Okay now Julia I'm serious. What did you say and what did you say l'd do? </seg>
<seg id="87"> Anyhoo l could explain what l said which would be boring or Marcy over here who is an incredible actress could act it out for you which I think will give you a better idea of what you have in store for you tonight. </seg>
<seg id="88"> Okay so just tell me your way. - So we'll act it out with Marcy? - Sure. </seg>
<seg id="89"> Okay give Marcy your drink. Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Okay so you're in a club or a bar and Marcy's a kind of cute or kind of hot or kind of sexy or better be fucking hysterically funny but not funny-looking guy who you could fuck. </seg>
<seg id="91"> - Got it. - Okay Marcy take it. </seg>
<seg id="92"> Howdy. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Hi there. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Excuse me but your name wouldn't be Butterfly would it? </seg>
<seg id="95"> Yes it is. lt seems you have me at a disadvantage. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Barry. Pleased to meet you Barry. - Y'all are getting me hot. - Shh! </seg>
<seg id="97"> So is uh Butterfly your real name? </seg>
<seg id="98"> Yes it is. And how'd you know my name Barry? </seg>
<seg id="99"> I listened to Jungle Julia's show this morning. </seg>
<seg id="100"> Oh you did did you? Oh yeah. l listen to her show every morning. </seg>
<seg id="101"> Oh you do do you? Yeah. She's like the coolest lady in town. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Don't you think she's got a big ass? Nah man. </seg>
<seg id="103"> I like her ass that way. </seg>
<seg id="104"> She got a black girl's ass. </seg>
<seg id="105"> Well that's what she always says but natural fact she doesn't really have a black girl's ass. - She's got a big ass. - Okay what the fuck are you doing? </seg>
<seg id="106"> Oh look who wants to get to the point all of a sudden. Okay we'll get to the point. </seg>
<seg id="107"> But for your information skinny bitch black men and a whole lot of motherfucking white men have had plenty fun adoring my ass. </seg>
<seg id="108"> I don't wear their teeth marks on my butt for nothing. </seg>
<seg id="109"> All right if you're not gonna buy me a drink can I have mine back? No. Okay okay okay okay. </seg>
<seg id="110"> So Butterfly can I buy you a drink? - l'd love one. - What can l get you? I'll take a margarita. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Here you go. </seg>
<seg id="112"> So after they buy you a drink when they raise their glass to toast they look you dead in the eye and repeat this poem: "The woods are lovely dark and deep "and l have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep. </seg>
<seg id="113"> "Did you hear me Butterfly? </seg>
<seg id="114"> Miles to go before you sleep." </seg>
<seg id="115"> And then if they say that... you gotta give them a lap dance. What? </seg>
<seg id="116"> If they call you Butterfly buy you a drink repeat that poem you gotta give them a lap dance. That's bullshit. I ain't giving them nothing. Well you can do it or not but if you don't everybody in Austin's gonna think you're a chickenshit. And l don't think you want everybody in Austin thinking you're a chickenshit. </seg>
<seg id="117"> I ain't giving nobody no lap dance 'cause of what you said. </seg>
<seg id="118"> Oh come on. It's gonna be funny. Yeah everything's funny to you two when it's happening to me. </seg>
<seg id="119"> Look you don't have to do it for anybody you don't want. </seg>
<seg id="120"> l said you'd do it for the first guy who says it. So some geek comes over trying to be cool just tell him you already did it at another place earlier. </seg>
<seg id="121"> No harm no foul but you get a free drink out of it. But maybe a little later in the evening you've had a few drinks you're kind of loosey-goosey you're safe with your girls then some kind of cute kind of hot kind of sexy hysterically funny but not funny-looking guy comes up and says it then maybe you did it earlier maybe you didn't. </seg>
<seg id="122"> Where the hell is Lanna Frank? That's a good fucking question. </seg>
<seg id="123"> Lanna Frank! Where are you? </seg>
<seg id="124"> Well come over already. We're waiting for you. </seg>
<seg id="125"> Shit! Hold on! </seg>
<seg id="126"> So where are you? </seg>
<seg id="127"> Come over already. We're waiting for you. </seg>
<seg id="128"> No we're not coming over there. You come over here like you said you would. </seg>
<seg id="129"> So is it "Shawna" and the girls at the lake house this weekend? </seg>
<seg id="130"> - "Shawna"? - Oh fuck! I-- </seg>
<seg id="131"> No. Now there is one thing that every girl in the whole world whose name is Shanna has in common with each other we all hate the name Shawna and we really hate it when people call us Shawna. </seg>
<seg id="132"> Just remember it's Shanna Banana not Shawna Banawna. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Okay but at some point in the evening l had fuckability stock. </seg>
<seg id="134"> Yeah. l mean... it wasn't bullish but... </seg>
<seg id="135"> Okay Warren's sending over shots. And you know the house rule: </seg>
<seg id="136"> If he sends over shots you've gotta do them. - What? - Hey them's the rules baby. Warren says it we do it! </seg>
<seg id="137"> l love that philosophy: "Warren says it we do it." </seg>
<seg id="138"> - So let's do it! - What is it? </seg>
<seg id="139"> Hey shot first questions later. Here we go! Post time! </seg>
<seg id="140"> Mmm! </seg>
<seg id="141"> Whoo-hoo! </seg>
<seg id="142"> Now is that a tasty beverage or is that a tasty beverage? </seg>
<seg id="143"> What the fuck is it? </seg>
<seg id="144"> Chartreuse the only liquor so good they named a color after it. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Who's down for dos Chartreuse? </seg>
<seg id="146"> Not me. - l'm going out for a smoke. </seg>
<seg id="147"> But careful where you keep that hot flame all right? </seg>
<seg id="148"> Drinks. What can I get you? Shanna Banana? </seg>
<seg id="149"> Another big-ass Long Island iced tea. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Bombay Sapphire and tonic no ice. Good boy. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Oh hey Punky uh one of the lights is off in the parking lot. Flip it. </seg>
<seg id="152"> - Oh Jesus Christ! - Whoa! </seg>
<seg id="153"> You scared the fuck out of me you shitty asshole! </seg>
<seg id="154"> l swear Arlene I was not trying to scare you. </seg>
<seg id="155"> I just got lucky. Oh hardy-fucking-har. Go inside. - Wait a minute. - Why? - l was thinking we could make out. - What on a porch? Not even in the bar but in front of the entrance? </seg>
<seg id="156"> - Forget it. - No in my car. </seg>
<seg id="157"> What out there? It's wet as fucking 'Nam out there. Not in my car it's not. </seg>
<seg id="158"> Look you won't get wet. I promise you. </seg>
<seg id="159"> You know most guys wouldn't brag about that. </seg>
<seg id="160"> Ha-ha-ha. You know what l mean. </seg>
<seg id="161"> Look l know you guys are going to Lake LBJ and we can't come. I wanna make out! Okay just stop with the whining. lt's not attractive. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Okay but I don't want it super-fucking obvious </seg>
<seg id="163"> to everybody in the bar l've been gone so we'll go in your car we'll make out for six minutes and that's it. </seg>
<seg id="164"> - Deal? - Great. </seg>
<seg id="165"> No no no. Deal or no deal? If you're gonna whine when l pull the plug in six minutes we can just walk back inside the fucking bar right now. </seg>
<seg id="166"> - Deal. No whining. - And no begging. And no begging. When you say done it's done. </seg>
<seg id="167"> I'm gonna remember you said that. Okay let's go. </seg>
<seg id="168"> Oh you got two jobs: kiss good and make sure my hair don't get wet. </seg>
<seg id="169"> Now look you can't look like you're trying to get her out of here before Christian Simonson shows up </seg>
<seg id="170"> but you've got to get her out of here before Christian Simonson shows up. </seg>
<seg id="171"> But what's the point? They're going to Shanna's daddy's house at Lake LBJ and it's no guys-- absolutely no guys. </seg>
<seg id="172"> Okay so after we bring the girls drinks in fairly rapid order but not obvious we order two more rounds of shots. You think they're gonna fall for that? </seg>
<seg id="173"> We'll be very convincing. Now it's time to turn up the volume. No more fucking around. We go to Jäger shots. </seg>
<seg id="174"> Man they're not gonna drink Jäger shots. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Dude as long as a guy's buying the booze a fucking bitch'll drink anything. </seg>
<seg id="176"> Come on dude we can at least get one shot of Jäger down these fucking bitches' throats. </seg>
<seg id="177"> After that we'll see if they got another Jäger shot in them. </seg>
<seg id="178"> You never know. That could be the shot that puts them past the point of "fuck it." </seg>
<seg id="179"> Then all of a sudden "no guys at the lake house" turns into "a couple of guys at the lake house." My point exactly. </seg>
<seg id="180"> l know l can at least get Shanna "Suck My" Banana to do a fucking Buttery Nipple shot. </seg>
<seg id="181"> What's Julia's sweet shot? - Key lime pie. - Oh come on. Even fucking Leroy Brown'd do one more for dessert. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Dude check it out. I wonder if B.J. brought the Bear with him. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Jesus! </seg>
<seg id="184"> Dude fucking cut himself falling out of his time machine. </seg>
<seg id="185"> Could l get a chicken suit for Stroker Ace please? </seg>
<seg id="186"> And where did you two disappear to? I had to get something out of the car and Nate was gentlemanly enough to escort me with his umbrella. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Ah good for you Nate. You see that pretty girl sitting by herself at the bar? </seg>
<seg id="188"> Who the dirty hippie? Meow. She's not a hippie. </seg>
<seg id="189"> She might as well be a hippie. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Thank you Timmy boy. Well do you know what just happened to her? </seg>
<seg id="191"> No. But I know she's a skinny fake-blonde bitch. </seg>
<seg id="192"> Oh l'm sorry. You were telling a story. What about her? </seg>
<seg id="193"> Hey Warren is there anybody in this place you could vouch for to give me a ride home? </seg>
<seg id="194"> Fair lady your chariot awaits. You've been eavesdropping? </seg>
<seg id="195"> Oh eavesdropping and can't help but hear. I think I belong in the latter category. </seg>
<seg id="196"> So uh Icy Hot are you offering me a ride home? </seg>
<seg id="197"> l'm offering you a lift if when l'm ready to leave you are too. </seg>
<seg id="198"> And when are you thinking about leaving? </seg>
<seg id="199"> Truthfully I'm not thinking about it. But when l do you will be the first to know. </seg>
<seg id="200"> Will you be able to uh drive later? </seg>
<seg id="201"> I know looks can be deceiving but I'm a teetotaler. </seg>
<seg id="202"> I've been drinking club soda and lime all night and now l'm building up to my big drink. </seg>
<seg id="203"> Which is what? Virgin piña colada. </seg>
<seg id="204"> Okay. Why would someone who doesn't drink spend hours at a bar drinking water? </seg>
<seg id="205"> A bar offers all kind of things other than alcohol. </seg>
<seg id="206"> Mmm. Really? Like what? </seg>
<seg id="207"> Women nacho grande platters the fellowship of some fascinating individuals like Warren here. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Alcohol is just a lubricant for all the individual encounters that a barroom offers. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Ooh. Is that cowboy wisdom? I'm not a cowboy Pam. </seg>
<seg id="210"> I'm a stuntman. But that's a very easy mistake to make. </seg>
<seg id="211"> How do you know my name? </seg>
<seg id="212"> When you were talking with Warren couldn't help but overhear. </seg>
<seg id="213"> Fair enough. So what's your name Icy? </seg>
<seg id="214"> Stuntman Mike. Stuntman Mike's your name? </seg>
<seg id="215"> You ask anybody. </seg>
<seg id="216"> Hey Warren who is this guy? Stuntman Mike. </seg>
<seg id="217"> - And who the hell is Stuntman Mike? - He's a stuntman. </seg>
<seg id="218"> You know Pam I think it's time for my big drink. </seg>
<seg id="219"> Well Stuntman Mike since I have a tab here can l buy you that virgin piña colada? </seg>
<seg id="220"> Thank you Pam. That would be lovely. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Warren a uh virgin piña colada for my stuntman friend </seg>
<seg id="222"> and I'll have another Cadillac Cabo Wabo margarita. </seg>
<seg id="223"> Cabo Wabo virgin. </seg>
<seg id="224"> That table. Seems to keep um getting your attention. Is that the girl from the billboard outside? - Yep. - She sure is a striking-looking woman. </seg>
<seg id="225"> It's got gin tequila-- </seg>
<seg id="226"> - Look at that hair. - Lots of leave-in conditioner. </seg>
<seg id="227"> - ls that jealousy l detect? - Hardly. </seg>
<seg id="228"> But if you wanna get with uh Jungle Julia there's a real easy way to do that. - Really? - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="229"> - What would that be? - Get famous. </seg>
<seg id="230"> You won't have to find her. She'll find you. </seg>
<seg id="231"> And you don't even wanna know what she did for that billboard. </seg>
<seg id="232"> Enjoy it cocksucker. You've earned it. </seg>
<seg id="233"> What did she ever do to you? </seg>
<seg id="234"> We went to school together from kindergarten through high school. </seg>
<seg id="235"> That's what she did to me. </seg>
<seg id="236"> She was her height right now at 12. She was a monster. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Half the guys she still fucks from the old class she used to beat up and terrorize in the fifth grade. </seg>
<seg id="238"> l see. And she used to beat you up and take your chocolate milk huh? </seg>
<seg id="239"> That pituitary case? Might've kicked my ass a couple of times. </seg>
<seg id="240"> Sorry. l'm built like a girl not a black man. But I'd die before I ever gave Julia Lucai my chocolate milk. </seg>
<seg id="241"> Hey are you famous or something? </seg>
<seg id="242"> Or something. No no no. Really. </seg>
<seg id="243"> Hey what do you do? Really? </seg>
<seg id="244"> What I do is work my ass off to get my own record label off the ground. </seg>
<seg id="245"> But why that girl wanted a picture of me is because l'm a local deejay. </seg>
<seg id="246"> Wait a minute. </seg>
<seg id="247"> You got a billboard by Big Kahuna Burger don't you? Yeah. I got one there too Zatoichi. Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="248"> Jungle Julia Lucai. Stuntman Mike McKay. </seg>
<seg id="249"> Well good to meet you Stuntman Mike. </seg>
<seg id="250"> Now my friends and I are gonna continue to get our weed on. </seg>
<seg id="251"> - Would you care for some? - Thank you Julia. But just the same no thanks. </seg>
<seg id="252"> - Suit yourself. - But you know-- </seg>
<seg id="253"> Aw shit. Oh God. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Sorry. lt's nothing. </seg>
<seg id="255"> What the fuck was that? </seg>
<seg id="256"> Actually l do want you to have a shot. </seg>
<seg id="257"> You got some voucher here. </seg>
<seg id="258"> I asked him what movies you worked on. No fucking clue. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Well technically l really don't know if he's ever done anything for sure. </seg>
<seg id="260"> I mean he shows me an episode of High Chaparall a guy falls off a horse he says it's him. </seg>
<seg id="261"> You know the show The Virginian? </seg>
<seg id="262"> Yeah well there was another actor on that show-- Gary Clarke-- and I looked like him a bit. </seg>
<seg id="263"> Obviously before I cut myself shaving. </seg>
<seg id="264"> Oh I like it. </seg>
<seg id="265"> Well damn if you ain't so sweet you make sugar taste just like salt. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Anyway I did a lot of Virginians doubling Gary Clarke. </seg>
<seg id="267"> And uh then that show turned into The Men of Shiloh they brought on Lee Majors and l doubled him. </seg>
<seg id="268"> From that point on I specialized mostly in car stunts. </seg>
<seg id="269"> Yeah I did damn near the whole third season of Vegas. </seg>
<seg id="270"> I was Robert Urich's driving double. </seg>
<seg id="271"> And then Bob did another show-- Gavilan and he brought me with him on that till... </seg>
<seg id="272"> And after that... </seg>
<seg id="273"> Do you know any of these shows or people I'm talking about? </seg>
<seg id="274"> Sorry. - No. - No. </seg>
<seg id="275"> So how exactly does one become a stuntman Stuntman Mike? </seg>
<seg id="276"> Well in Hollywood anybody fool enough to throw himself down a flight of stairs can usually find somebody to pay him for it. </seg>
<seg id="277"> But really l got into the business the way most people get in the stunt business. - How's that? - My brother got me in it. - Well who's your brother? - Stuntman Bob. </seg>
<seg id="278"> - I'm ready to blaze. - Finally. Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="279"> - You need to catch up with us. - Now the party can start. </seg>
<seg id="280"> Yep. Anyhoo l'm sorry. Will you forgive me? </seg>
<seg id="281"> But you have to be real nice to me for the whole rest of the time l'm here. </seg>
<seg id="282"> - Promise. You ready to go to the lake? - Mm-hmm. </seg>
<seg id="283"> How about your little friend? You wanna bring him? I thought no boys. If you really want him to come Shanna won't mind. </seg>
<seg id="284"> So how about it? Boys or just us girls? Us girls. Good idea. </seg>
<seg id="285"> Ladies. </seg>
<seg id="286"> Thanks. Cheers Butterfly. </seg>
<seg id="287"> "The woods are lovely dark and deep "and I have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep. </seg>
<seg id="288"> "Did you hear me Butterfly? </seg>
<seg id="289"> Miles to go before you sleep." </seg>
<seg id="290"> Sorry Stuntman Burt-- Mike. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Mike. She already broke off that dance. Is that true? </seg>
<seg id="292"> Did l miss my chance? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Do I frighten you? </seg>
<seg id="294"> Is it my scar? </seg>
<seg id="295"> It's your car. Ah. Yeah I know. </seg>
<seg id="296"> Sorry. It's my mom's car. </seg>
<seg id="297"> Have you been following us? No. But that's what I love about Austin. It's just so damn small. </seg>
<seg id="298"> - You've seen this guy before? - l saw him outside of Guero's. </seg>
<seg id="299"> And l saw you outside Guero's too. </seg>
<seg id="300"> You saw my car l saw your legs. </seg>
<seg id="301"> Now look I ain't stalking y'all but I didn't say I wasn't a wolf. </seg>
<seg id="302"> So you really weren't following us? I'm not following you Butterfly. </seg>
<seg id="303"> I just got lucky. </seg>
<seg id="304"> So how about that lap dance? </seg>
<seg id="305"> Sorry. lt was a one-time-only offer and she did it earlier this evening at Anton's. </seg>
<seg id="306"> - No she didn't. - How do you know? </seg>
<seg id="307"> I'm good that way. And you look a little touchéd. </seg>
<seg id="308"> - What's "touchéd"? - Wounded slightly. </seg>
<seg id="309"> Why should I be wounded? Because you expected guys to be pestering you all night but from your look I can tell nobody pestered you at all. That kind of hurt your feelings a little bit didn't it? There are few things as fetching as a bruised ego on a beautiful angel. </seg>
<seg id="310"> So... how about that lap dance? </seg>
<seg id="311"> I think I'm gonna have to give you a rain check. </seg>
<seg id="312"> Well since you'll be leaving in the next couple of days that rain check will be worthless. </seg>
<seg id="313"> But that's okay. </seg>
<seg id="314"> I understand if I make you uncomfortable. </seg>
<seg id="315"> You're still a nice girl and I still like you. </seg>
<seg id="316"> But I must warn you of something. </seg>
<seg id="317"> You know how people say... </seg>
<seg id="318"> "You're okay in my book" or "ln my book that's no good"? </seg>
<seg id="319"> Well l actually have a book. And everybody I ever meet goes in this book. </seg>
<seg id="320"> And now l've met you and you're going in the book. </seg>
<seg id="321"> Except l'm afraid I must file you... under "chickenshit." </seg>
<seg id="322"> And what if l did it? </seg>
<seg id="323"> Well I definitely couldn't file you under "chickenshit" then now could I? </seg>
<seg id="324"> What's your name again? Stuntman Mike. </seg>
<seg id="325"> Well Stuntman Mike l'm Butterfly. My friend Jungle Julia over here says that jukebox inside is pretty impressive. </seg>
<seg id="326"> - Yeah it is. - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="327"> Why don't you go get ready for your lap dance? </seg>
<seg id="328"> What about "kind of cute kind of hot kind of sexy hysterically funny but not funny-looking guy who you could fuck" did you not understand? </seg>
<seg id="329"> I think you got Mike laid tonight. </seg>
<seg id="330"> - He's old enough to be my dad-- - I can still hear you. </seg>
<seg id="331"> - Bye. - Bye-bye. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Wow that's fucking scary. Yeah well I wanted it to be impressive. </seg>
<seg id="333"> Scary tends to impress. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Is it safe? Oh it's better than safe. It's death proof. </seg>
<seg id="335"> How do you make a car death proof? Well that's what stuntmen do. You've seen a movie where a car gets into some smash-up there ain't no way in hell anybody's walking away from? </seg>
<seg id="336"> Yeah. Well how do you think they accomplish that? </seg>
<seg id="337"> CGI? </seg>
<seg id="338"> Well unfortunately Pam nowadays more often than not you're right. </seg>
<seg id="339"> But back in the all-or-nothing days the Vanishing Point days the Dirty Mary Crazy Larry days the White Line Fever days-- real cars smashing into real cars with real dumb people driving them. </seg>
<seg id="340"> So you give the stunt team the car you want to smash up take her and reinforce that fucker everywhere and voilà you got yourself a death-proof automobile. </seg>
<seg id="341"> That makes sense. I just didn't know you could make a car death proof. </seg>
<seg id="342"> Hell I can drive this baby into a brick wall doing 125 miles an hour just for the experience. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Why is your passenger seat in a box? Well this is a movie car. </seg>
<seg id="344"> Sometimes when you're shooting a crash director wants to put a camera in the car. You know shoot the crash from the inside. </seg>
<seg id="345"> That's where you put the camera. They call it a crash box. Here. </seg>
<seg id="346"> There you go. </seg>
<seg id="347"> You know when you asked to drive me home you didn't mention your car didn't have a passenger seat. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Yeah well actually I didn't ask to drive you home. You asked me for a ride and l said yes. But look at the bright side Pam. I won't be getting fresh putting my hand on your knee. That is the bright side. </seg>
<seg id="349"> I thought so. </seg>
<seg id="350"> Well Pam which way you going? - Left or right? - Right. Ah that's too bad. Why? </seg>
<seg id="351"> Well because there was a 50-50 shot on whether you'd be going left or right. </seg>
<seg id="352"> You see we're both going left. You could've just as easily been going left too and if that was the case it would've been a while before you started getting scared. </seg>
<seg id="353"> But since you're going the other way I'm afraid... you're gonna have to start getting scared...immediately. </seg>
<seg id="354"> What the fuck? </seg>
<seg id="355"> Cocksucking motherfucker! Just fucking let me out of here! </seg>
<seg id="356"> I'll fucking rip your fucking-- Stop the fucking car! </seg>
<seg id="357"> Okay here's the thing. I get it. </seg>
<seg id="358"> I-- l know it's a joke and it's super-funny. </seg>
<seg id="359"> Um but if you just stop right now you know and-- and-- and let me out I'll never tell anybody because l know it's a joke. </seg>
<seg id="360"> I know all about jokes. I promise everything will be fine. </seg>
<seg id="361"> Just-- Just-- Just let me out please and-- and-- Hey Pam </seg>
<seg id="362"> remember when I said this car was death proof? </seg>
<seg id="363"> Well that wasn't a lie. </seg>
<seg id="364"> This car is 100% death proof. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Only to get the benefit of it honey you really need to be sitting in my seat. </seg>
<seg id="366"> Now I gotta catch me my other girlfriends. </seg>
<seg id="367"> No no no no.lt's Dave Dee Dozy Beaky Mitch and Tich. </seg>
<seg id="368"> So you got it? Thanks honey. You're gonna play it next song right? </seg>
<seg id="369"> Good boy. </seg>
<seg id="370"> Growl. </seg>
<seg id="371"> Bye-bye. </seg>
<seg id="372"> Who do you wanna hear? Dave Dee Dozy Beaky Mitch and Tich. </seg>
<seg id="373"> Who? Dave Dee Dozy Beaky Mitch and Tich. </seg>
<seg id="374"> Who the fuck are they? For your information Pete Townshend at one point almost quit The Who and if he had he would've ended up in this group thus making it Dave Dee Dozy Beaky Mitch Tich and Pete. And if you ask me he should have. That's my boy! I wanna hear this part of the song louder! </seg>
<seg id="375"> Do you remember anything? </seg>
<seg id="376"> Uh l don't remember. </seg>
<seg id="377"> Dr. Block. </seg>
<seg id="378"> Well what's the patient's prognosis Dr. Block? </seg>
<seg id="379"> I don't really see it's any of your business. Come on now sis. You just tell us. </seg>
<seg id="380"> How bad is he? </seg>
<seg id="381"> He got banged up real good. Busted nose broken collarbone smashed up his left index finger. Is that it? </seg>
<seg id="382"> He was real lucky. </seg>
<seg id="383"> That'll be all? Why that's more than enough and I wanna thank you Dr. Block. </seg>
<seg id="384"> Son of a bitch! </seg>
<seg id="385"> So Pop what do you think? Well son number one what I think is so goddamn ghoulish I hesitate to speak it out loud. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Well give it a shot. Well what we have here is a case of vehicular homicide. </seg>
<seg id="387"> That old boy in there murdered them pretty little gals. </seg>
<seg id="388"> I mean he used a car and not a hatchet but they dead just the same. </seg>
<seg id="389"> Well what are you gonna do? Not a goddamn thing. </seg>
<seg id="390"> The DA says ain't no crime here. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Every one of them gals was swimming in alcohol and floating on weed. And old Hooper in there came out clean as a whistle. </seg>
<seg id="392"> Now you actually think that he premeditatedly murdered them gals? </seg>
<seg id="393"> Well I can't prove it but since thinking don't cost nothing I can think it and I do. </seg>
<seg id="394"> Yeah but Pop he got pretty banged up hisself. </seg>
<seg id="395"> Well hell yeah he got banged up but God damn! Them pretty little gals look like a goddamn giant chewed 'em up and spit 'em out. </seg>
<seg id="396"> Any of 'em survive? Shit. </seg>
<seg id="397"> Two tons of metal flesh and bone and plain old Newton... They all princess died. </seg>
<seg id="398"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="399"> Well l'd guestimate it's a sex thing. </seg>
<seg id="400"> The only way l can figure it. </seg>
<seg id="401"> High-velocity impact twisted metal busted glass all four souls taken exactly at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="402"> Probably the only way that diabolical degenerate can shoot his goo. </seg>
<seg id="403"> Yeah l think the only thing we can dream of getting that bastard on is vehicular manslaughter for the hitchhiker in the death box. That was just plain old goddamn reckless endangerment. </seg>
<seg id="404"> But I got me a goddamn bartender gonna testify that old Stuntman Mike didn't drink a drop all night and his passenger was left stranded by her date in the goddamn rain no less and she asked him for the fucking ride. </seg>
<seg id="405"> Now on paper it's gonna look like he's just trying to help her out. </seg>
<seg id="406"> I mean that's the way the jury's gonna see it. So what are you gonna do Pop? </seg>
<seg id="407"> Well l can take it upon myself to work the case you know in my off hours. </seg>
<seg id="408"> Search for evidence you know to prove my theory. Alert authorities. Dog that rotten son of a bitch. </seg>
<seg id="409"> Wherever he goes I go. Or I can spend the same goddamn amount of time and energy following the NASCAR circuit. Hmm. I thought about it a lot. </seg>
<seg id="410"> I think l'd have a hell of lot happier life if I did the latter. </seg>
<seg id="411"> And just because I can't punish old... Frankenstein in there for what he's done I'm gonna tell you like the Lord told John. If he ever does it again I can make goddamn sure he don't do it in Texas. </seg>
<seg id="412"> - So are you on the same floor with him? - No he's on the 4th and l'm on the 7th. </seg>
<seg id="413"> - Who's in whose room? - He's in mine. </seg>
<seg id="414"> - And so what happened then? - That was pretty much it. We made out in the hall for about 10 minutes and then I sent him off to his room. - So how's The Rock as a kisser? - Mmm he's damn good! He's got them mushy lips and fingertips. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Mmm l love them mushy lips. And he's a big guy so he spins me around so my back's up against him. Then he takes his big hand and he puts it on my throat tilts my head back and leans over me kisses me from behind. </seg>
<seg id="416"> - Damn that sounds sexy! - Mmm it was sexy. </seg>
<seg id="417"> But then that was it? You sent him off? </seg>
<seg id="418"> How'd he take it? Wait a minute. What are we doing here? </seg>
<seg id="419"> lf I'm gonna power through and pick up Zoë at the airport I need a big-ass cup of coffee. Since you're getting that can you get some more vodka and some more sugar-free Red Bull? </seg>
<seg id="420"> We didn't know you were awake. I'm not awake. l'm asleep. </seg>
<seg id="421"> But get some more vodka and some more sugar-free Red Bull anyway. And some Red Apple Tans. </seg>
<seg id="422"> Damn! I didn't stop to get you bitches groceries! </seg>
<seg id="423"> - You remember how to get to the airport don't you? - Uh-huh. </seg>
<seg id="424"> Well then you should get behind the wheel 'cause you gonna drive. </seg>
<seg id="425"> Motherfuckers! </seg>
<seg id="426"> They ain't got sugar-free Red Bull. They got regular Red Bull and sugar-free G.O. juice. </seg>
<seg id="427"> - G.O. - G.O.! </seg>
<seg id="428"> Where the hell are my keys? Oh here they are. </seg>
<seg id="429"> Oh sorry. l didn't mean to give you a concert there. </seg>
<seg id="430"> No it wasn't you. That guy bumped into my feet when he walked by. </seg>
<seg id="431"> I don't know why but that kind of creeped me out. </seg>
<seg id="432"> Little dick. </seg>
<seg id="433"> Clearly. </seg>
<seg id="434"> Since I'm up I might as well hit the ATM. Get me a fucking smoke. </seg>
<seg id="435"> What? Did you just see the-- What? Nothing honey. </seg>
<seg id="436"> Yello. It's me. Miss me? </seg>
<seg id="437"> Oh you best get your ass off Kim's car. </seg>
<seg id="438"> I've seen Kim sit on it before. Her ass ain't your ass. </seg>
<seg id="439"> Okay. </seg>
<seg id="440"> So I think I'm in this month's issue of Allure. </seg>
<seg id="441"> You got Allure? Magazines by the window. </seg>
<seg id="442"> Here you are! </seg>
<seg id="443"> You hot mama you. </seg>
<seg id="444"> See you in a second. </seg>
<seg id="445"> And you get 15 and change back. Thank you very much. </seg>
<seg id="446"> You know l got other fashion magazines for sale behind the counter. </seg>
<seg id="447"> No that's okay. This'll be all. </seg>
<seg id="448"> - Thought I'd ask. - Thanks anyway. Have a good one. </seg>
<seg id="449"> I got this month's issue of Italian Vogue. </seg>
<seg id="450"> This month's? </seg>
<seg id="451"> Listen to this. </seg>
<seg id="452"> The Circle A clerk has this month's issue of Italian Vogue. </seg>
<seg id="453"> - No way. - Way. </seg>
<seg id="454"> l can't believe a fucking Circle A carries Italian Vogue. </seg>
<seg id="455"> It doesn't. It's his own personal copy. </seg>
<seg id="456"> He'll let it go for 27 bucks. Twenty-seven bucks? </seg>
<seg id="457"> What the fuck do you care? We're talking about fucking per diem here. </seg>
<seg id="458"> Look we found an issue of Italian Vogue in Lebanon Tennessee. We're lucky he's not asking for fucking Krugerrands. I'm getting it and we're splitting it three ways. </seg>
<seg id="459"> What me you and Kim? No Kim doesn't give a shit about Italian Vogue. </seg>
<seg id="460"> But Brandy will come in with us and if she won't Tysla her sister will. </seg>
<seg id="461"> Okay. But if anybody tears out any sheets I want you gotta make color Xerox of those pages. And l'm not talking fucking Kinko's here either okay? You take it to the art department you have them do it fucking right. </seg>
<seg id="462"> Well l'm doing Lindsay Lohan's makeup and she's off for the next three days there's no stunts being filmed during that time so Kim's free and Lee's on a "will notify" for the next four days. </seg>
<seg id="463"> So how's the shoot going? Great. We're having the best time. </seg>
<seg id="464"> The director Cecil Evans is so much fun. </seg>
<seg id="465"> We're making the coolest movie and partying all the time. </seg>
<seg id="466"> Hell yeah. The next job after this one is definitely gonna suck. </seg>
<seg id="467"> So let's hear it ladies. Set romances. Who's getting it off? </seg>
<seg id="468"> That would be Lee and Toolbox. Oh Toolbox. Name sounds promising. </seg>
<seg id="469"> - He's a grip. - What he is is a pervert. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Well he just keeps sounding better and better. </seg>
<seg id="471"> What's his perversion? </seg>
<seg id="472"> He likes to watch me pee. </seg>
<seg id="473"> Lee is sitting on the toilet and Toolbox is watching her pee. </seg>
<seg id="474"> P-I-S-S-l-N-G. </seg>
<seg id="475"> Yeah but not no more. Now she's getting it on with The Rock. </seg>
<seg id="476"> - You're having one off with The Rock? - Not the real Rock. He's this electrician named Bruce. </seg>
<seg id="477"> And Kim started calling him The Rock 'cause he kind of looks like The Rock so now we all just call him The Rock. Oh yeah. This is an all-star crew. </seg>
<seg id="478"> We got a guy who looks like Nick Cage and a guy who looks like Pee-wee Herman too. </seg>
<seg id="479"> Kim dick department. Let's hear it. </seg>
<seg id="480"> Mm-mm. No dick this trip. I got a man. </seg>
<seg id="481"> - How long have you had this boyfriend? - About three months. </seg>
<seg id="482"> Who'd you steal him from? - Nobody. - Kim! Wha-- What? He totally had a girlfriend. </seg>
<seg id="483"> All of Kim's boyfriends start out as somebody else's boyfriend. </seg>
<seg id="484"> I did not steal him. I didn't steal any of them. They just...jumped ship. </seg>
<seg id="485"> So what's your story Abernathy? </seg>
<seg id="486"> Oh Abbie's got the big kahuna. </seg>
<seg id="487"> I had a set crush on Cecil. Set crush? Nigga please! You were his set wife. </seg>
<seg id="488"> "Were" and "had" being the key words here. </seg>
<seg id="489"> Bitch you two are still into each other and you know it. </seg>
<seg id="490"> Yeah well if he's so in love with me then whey did he fuck Daryl Hannah's stand-in? </seg>
<seg id="491"> Ho-ho-ho! Yes men are dogs. Oh it's so funny! </seg>
<seg id="492"> Oh it's so funny! Oh stop acting all hurt. Your ass just mad. Yeah he's a stand-in fucker. </seg>
<seg id="493"> Bitch you need to get over that shit. That was two weeks ago. </seg>
<seg id="494"> Oh well now that you put it like that. </seg>
<seg id="495"> Oh l haven't told you the best part. He fucked her on my birthday. </seg>
<seg id="496"> Oh that's a horse of a different color. Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="497"> Did he know it was your birthday? He's the director. He's kind of busy. </seg>
<seg id="498"> He ate a piece of my birthday cake and he got me a present. Yeah l think he knew. Well what did he get you? </seg>
<seg id="499"> He made me a tape. </seg>
<seg id="500"> He made you a tape? - Yeah. - Wait. </seg>
<seg id="501"> He didn't burn you a CD. He made you a tape? - Yeah. - Oh that is so romantic. Yes. I know what you're gonna say so don't even go there. That sounds like the test of true love to me. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Look I know you guys like him. He's likable but he fucked another woman on my birthday. </seg>
<seg id="503"> How can you not be on my side? </seg>
<seg id="504"> Well l admit that sounds bad. It is bad! </seg>
<seg id="505"> It just sounds like there's a little more to it than that. </seg>
<seg id="506"> - Were you two fucking? - Hell no. </seg>
<seg id="507"> Hello. Is your name Abernathy? Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="508"> The answer to your question is no of course not. </seg>
<seg id="509"> What do you mean "No of course not"? </seg>
<seg id="510"> The reason Cecil hasn't had a girlfriend in six years is because girls will fuck him. And if you fuck Cecil you don't become one of his girlfriends. </seg>
<seg id="511"> Not to say I want to be his girlfriend but if l did want to be his girlfriend if I fucked him I wouldn't be his girlfriend. I'd be one of his regulars. </seg>
<seg id="512"> And l'm just getting too fucking old for that shit. </seg>
<seg id="513"> Have you let him do anything? Yes! </seg>
<seg id="514"> I've let him give me a foot massage and when we go to the movies I've let him hold my hand. </seg>
<seg id="515"> Bitch you might be acting like you 12 years old but he just acting like a man. You need to break that nigga off a piece. </seg>
<seg id="516"> Let me get this straight. - You're not fucking him... - Mm-mm. - you're not sucking him... - Mm-mm. you're not giving him any tongue but Daryl Hannah's stand-in is. Okay can we just take my sex life off the table? </seg>
<seg id="517"> Actually uh it was Cecil's sex life that was on the table and your lack of one. </seg>
<seg id="518"> Ohhh! Fuck both of you and your little high five. </seg>
<seg id="519"> Before you can claim a nigga you got to claim a nigga and you can start by giving that motherfucker a hand job in the back of the van on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="520"> I'm not gonna do that. I know you won't. But you know who will. </seg>
<seg id="521"> The bitch that ends up living in that big-ass mansion of his. </seg>
<seg id="522"> Now I gotta say I haven't entirely agreed with everything Kim said but it is true: if you stretch shit out like you have with Cecil and you suddenly get dirty on them it blows their mind. </seg>
<seg id="523"> So Zoë Kim and I are in the Philippines at an outdoor rave. </seg>
<seg id="524"> - What were you working on? - Three Kicks to the Head Part Three. </seg>
<seg id="525"> And admittedly we're a little fucked-up. </seg>
<seg id="526"> - Cheers to that. - Word. </seg>
<seg id="527"> Cheers. </seg>
<seg id="528"> So Zoë the genius wants to take a picture of me. </seg>
<seg id="529"> It's dark as hell and you can't see shit. </seg>
<seg id="530"> So she's got her camera and keeps saying "Step back a little" so I do. Then "A little further" so l step back a little further. Then "A little more" so l do. </seg>
<seg id="531"> Then I realize I'm right at the edge of a seven-foot concrete ditch with God knows how many rocks and broken bottles and rats in it and if l fell in that fucking thing I'd probably would've broken my fucking neck. </seg>
<seg id="532"> So l'm yelling at her "Zoë you almost killed me!" </seg>
<seg id="533"> So we laugh about it and walk a little further and Zoë starts fucking around and damn if she doesn't fall in the fucking ditch. </seg>
<seg id="534"> Nice. Nice. Thank you. Yep. Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="535"> I remember taking a step and looking down. Just as l'm thinking "There's that ditch Abbie was talking about" bam l'm in the fucking ditch you know? What happened? </seg>
<seg id="536"> What with Zoë the cat? Nothing. </seg>
<seg id="537"> If I fell in that fucking thing they would've had to helicopter me out of there. </seg>
<seg id="538"> Zoë just lands on her feet. </seg>
<seg id="539"> But then later I started feeling a little bad about myself. </seg>
<seg id="540"> Zoë falls in the ditch and it's nothing. </seg>
<seg id="541"> We're laughing about it. </seg>
<seg id="542"> If I fell in that fucking thing I probably would've been fucking paralyzed. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Oh honey you can't think like that. </seg>
<seg id="544"> You know we all have our individual talents and that just happens to be one of Zoë's. </seg>
<seg id="545"> - Yeah. - Well... physically speaking Zoë is amazing. I mean agility reflexes nimbleness. </seg>
<seg id="546"> There's few human beings that can fuck with Zoë on that front. Oh Kim l like you too. </seg>
<seg id="547"> Having said that before you get too envious of Zoë's prowess you're missing the most important part of that story. </seg>
<seg id="548"> You didn't fall in the ditch Zoë did. </seg>
<seg id="549"> Zoë even knew there was a ditch there because you told her and she still fell in. </seg>
<seg id="550"> So Lee's right. We all have our talents. Hey l resemble that remark. </seg>
<seg id="551"> So Kim you still pack a roscoe? </seg>
<seg id="552"> Check it out bitch. - Ooh nice one mate. - I know this. </seg>
<seg id="553"> - What's a roscoe? - A roscoe is a pistol. </seg>
<seg id="554"> - You carry a gun? - Uh-huh. </seg>
<seg id="555"> - You have a license to carry it? - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="556"> When I became a Secret Service agent they gave me a license. </seg>
<seg id="557"> Oh l didn't know you were-- </seg>
<seg id="558"> Okay l didn't say it all right? Stop looking at me. l didn't say it. God! </seg>
<seg id="559"> Did you know Kim carried a gun? Yes. Now do I approve? No. </seg>
<seg id="560"> Do I know? Yes. </seg>
<seg id="561"> Look I don't know what futuristic utopia you live in but the world I live in a bitch need a gun. </seg>
<seg id="562"> You can't get around the fact that people who carry guns tend to get shot more than people who don't. </seg>
<seg id="563"> And you can't get around the fact that if l go down to the laundry room in my building at midnight enough times I might get my ass raped. </seg>
<seg id="564"> Don't do your laundry at midnight. Fuck that. I wanna do my laundry whenever the fuck I wanna do my laundry. </seg>
<seg id="565"> There are other things you can carry other than a gun. </seg>
<seg id="566"> Pepper spray. Uh motherfucker try to rape me I don't wanna give him a skin rash. </seg>
<seg id="567"> I wanna shut that nigga down. </seg>
<seg id="568"> How about a knife at least? </seg>
<seg id="569"> Yeah. You know what happens to motherfuckers carry knives? </seg>
<seg id="570"> They get shot! </seg>
<seg id="571"> Look if l ever become a famous actress I won't carry a gun. </seg>
<seg id="572"> I'll hire me a do-dirt nigga and he'll carry the gun. </seg>
<seg id="573"> And when shit goes down l'll sit back and laugh. But until that day it's Wild West motherfucker. </seg>
<seg id="574"> So Zoë you thought about what you want to do first? </seg>
<seg id="575"> It just so happens I know exactly what l wanna do. </seg>
<seg id="576"> Oh really? And what would that be? </seg>
<seg id="577"> To me there's no point in being in America unless you can drive a Detroit muscle car. </seg>
<seg id="578"> And l wanna drive a Dodge Challenger. Fuck me swinging balls out. </seg>
<seg id="579"> Um well I guess we can talk to Transpo. But does it have to be a Dodge Challenger? Not just that. </seg>
<seg id="580"> It has to be a 1970 Dodge Challenger with a 440 engine. </seg>
<seg id="581"> How in the fuck do you expect to do that? </seg>
<seg id="582"> No worries mate. I've got it all worked out. </seg>
<seg id="583"> When I knew l was coming here l went online and found out that the local paper here in Tennessee is the Lebanon News Sentinel. </seg>
<seg id="584"> - So back home-- - l'm sorry. Where's home? Australia right? </seg>
<seg id="585"> What do you mean by that mate? Zoë's from New Zealand and you never-- I repeat never-- call a Kiwi an Aussie. </seg>
<seg id="586"> That is unless you want your ass kicked. </seg>
<seg id="587"> I'm so sorry. I really am. </seg>
<seg id="588"> Oh it's okay. We're just taking the piss out of you mate. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Auckland to answer your question. </seg>
<seg id="590"> Anyway l subscribed to the local paper a month ago. </seg>
<seg id="591"> Now why the fuck you want a local redneck newspaper in New Zealand? </seg>
<seg id="592"> Pipe down and I'll tell you. </seg>
<seg id="593"> I've been getting the paper for the last month and I've been checking the classified at the back looking at cars for sale. </seg>
<seg id="594"> So as of yesterday for sale in this town some dude is selling a stock with a 440 engine and a white paint job. </seg>
<seg id="595"> And you wanna buy it? </seg>
<seg id="596"> Kim l may be stupid but I'm not bloody stupid. </seg>
<seg id="597"> I wanna say I wanna buy it so he'll let me test-drive it. </seg>
<seg id="598"> A 1970 Dodge Challenger with a white paint job. </seg>
<seg id="599"> - Oh uh Kowalski. - Kowalski from Vanishing Point. </seg>
<seg id="600"> - Mate it's a fucking classic! - Mmm I get it. If I can get this guy to let me drive it without him I will blow the doors off that bitch. </seg>
<seg id="601"> - What's Vanishing Point? - Oh God. "What's Vanishing Point?" </seg>
<seg id="602"> Abs I'm supposed to be the illiterate one. </seg>
<seg id="603"> lt's just one of the best American movies ever made. </seg>
<seg id="604"> Actually Zoë most girls wouldn't know Vanishing Point. </seg>
<seg id="605"> Excuse me. "Most girls"? What the fuck are you two? </seg>
<seg id="606"> Yeah well we're gearheads. Of course we watched it. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Y'all grew up watching that Pretty in Pink shit. </seg>
<seg id="608"> Oh I like Pretty in Pink. </seg>
<seg id="609"> What so you didn't watch John Hughes movies? </seg>
<seg id="610"> Of course l did. I'm a girl. </seg>
<seg id="611"> But l also watched car shit too. </seg>
<seg id="612"> - Vanishing Point Dirty Mary Crazy Larry... - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Gone in 60 Seconds-- </seg>
<seg id="613"> The real one not that Angelina Jolie bullshit. </seg>
<seg id="614"> We have an outdoors theater in Auckland. It plays Vanishing Point Big Wednesday all the classics. </seg>
<seg id="615"> What do you horny gals want? Hey you got a 1970 Dodge Challenger for sale? </seg>
<seg id="616"> Right up here ladies. </seg>
<seg id="617"> This shit is off the fucking hook! </seg>
<seg id="618"> Fucking legendary mate. </seg>
<seg id="619"> Sweet ass. Well if you'll excuse me for a moment I'd just like to have a word alone with my business associate. </seg>
<seg id="620"> - You ladies take your time. </seg>
<seg id="621"> What are you waiting for? Ask him to let you drive it by yourself. - I... I intend to but first I need to ask you something. What? </seg>
<seg id="622"> If he lets us take it out on our own I wanna play ship's mast. - Oh hell no! - Would you keep it down? </seg>
<seg id="623"> - Ain't no way I'm doing ship's mast. - For Christ sakes-- </seg>
<seg id="624"> - Don't blaspheme. - Sorry. </seg>
<seg id="625"> Now what did you say after the last time? </seg>
<seg id="626"> - Look l know what l said-- - What did you say? </seg>
<seg id="627"> - I know I said we shouldn't do this again - No. You didn't say we shouldn't. </seg>
<seg id="628"> You said we ain't ever gonna do that again. - Yeah but -"But" my ass! </seg>
<seg id="629"> You said not only are we never gonna play ship's mast again but you also said if you ever do what you trying to do now to not only refuse but that I had permission to physically restrain your ass if necessary. Now did you or did you not say that? </seg>
<seg id="630"> - Well. - No no no no. Answer the question motherfucker. </seg>
<seg id="631"> Did you or did you not say that? Yes I said that. However... Whatever with your "however." </seg>
<seg id="632"> Look I know l said it and I know I meant it. </seg>
<seg id="633"> Damn skippy you meant it. Yeah but when l said it I didn't mean in America. </seg>
<seg id="634"> - Oh nigga please! - Really-- </seg>
<seg id="635"> I meant we should never play ship's mast again in New Zealand or Australia. </seg>
<seg id="636"> You are such a liar. </seg>
<seg id="637"> Look I know what l said when I said it. But when I said it l didn't know I'd ever come to America. </seg>
<seg id="638"> And when I said it if l had known I was going to come to America and had the opportunity to play ship's mast with a fucking Vanishing Point Challenger I would've added a "however." Right? </seg>
<seg id="639"> Okay oddly enough I actually understood that. </seg>
<seg id="640"> However just because you talked yourself into some stupid shit doesn't mean I have lost my goddamn mind. </seg>
<seg id="641"> You need two people to play ship's mast and I ain't playing. </seg>
<seg id="642"> I'll be your best friend. </seg>
<seg id="643"> l don't need me no best friend lives on the other side of planet Earth. </seg>
<seg id="644"> - I'll crack your back. - You'll crack it anyway. </seg>
<seg id="645"> Well of course I'll crack it anyway. </seg>
<seg id="646"> But now while l'm here I'll be your back-cracking slave. </seg>
<seg id="647"> Whenever you want it you got it. You don't even have to ask for it. </seg>
<seg id="648"> You just order me to do it. Just be like... </seg>
<seg id="649"> "Bitch get over here and get busy." - You crack my back you'll give me foot massages... - Mm-hmm. Mmm. and after a shower you put moisturizer on my butt. Deal. </seg>
<seg id="650"> So we're gonna see if this guy'll let us take the car out without him. </seg>
<seg id="651"> If he does you wait here with Lee and we'll be back in a moment. </seg>
<seg id="652"> What? </seg>
<seg id="653"> I said we're gonna see if this guy'll let us take the car out without him. I heard what you said. I just can't believe what you said. </seg>
<seg id="654"> You know you two got some fucking balls. What? </seg>
<seg id="655"> Don't play dumbass with me. I've been up all night. I'm still a little drunk and I have a hangover. </seg>
<seg id="656"> l should be in my hotel room asleep not fucking around here on Tobacco Road. But because Zoë wanted to drive some fucking Vanishing Point car I'm here. </seg>
<seg id="657"> Now you two got the balls to ask me no scratch that, tell me l gotta go make conversation with Tom Joad while the cool kids get to go out and play? </seg>
<seg id="658"> Bullshit on that. - lt ain't like that. - Then what's it like Kim? </seg>
<seg id="659"> You guys are our collateral. He is never gonna go for it if we all go. </seg>
<seg id="660"> I really think one human being will be collateral enough. </seg>
<seg id="661"> You're not gonna wanna do what we're doing. What drive a car? </seg>
<seg id="662"> - Mmm. - We're doing more than that. What drive it fast? </seg>
<seg id="663"> We're doing more than that. Actually we're paying you a compliment 'cause we gonna do some stupid shit. But that's okay. We're stunt people. We ain't got good sense. </seg>
<seg id="664"> But you got good sense and anybody with good sense ain't gonna wanna do what we're doing. </seg>
<seg id="665"> How do you know I don't wanna do it? - 'Cause you're a mom. - Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="666"> You know we're supposed to be this big posse but that's the excuse you guys use whenever you want to exclude me from something. </seg>
<seg id="667"> So what is it you two daredevils are doing that I'm just so uncool I couldn't possibly understand? </seg>
<seg id="668"> You know we're kind of conning this guy so maybe it's best that we don't go into detail about it while he's watching us. </seg>
<seg id="669"> Besides he's probably not gonna let us do it anyway. </seg>
<seg id="670"> Okay. How about this? </seg>
<seg id="671"> I'll talk him into it. But if l talk him into it I go along. </seg>
<seg id="672"> - How you gonna do that? - Eh that's my problem. </seg>
<seg id="673"> But don't worry. He'll say yes. </seg>
<seg id="674"> What are you gonna do blow him? </seg>
<seg id="675"> No! </seg>
<seg id="676"> l'm gonna insinuate that Lee's gonna blow him. </seg>
<seg id="677"> That's good. Not really. But let me handle it. We got a deal? </seg>
<seg id="678"> Okay Mommy listen up. </seg>
<seg id="679"> You wanna hang with the cool kids you got to be cool. </seg>
<seg id="680"> We take you along you don't say shit.You don't even say crap. </seg>
<seg id="681"> You just sit in the back and I don't wanna hear a peep out of your ass you understand? - Got it. </seg>
<seg id="682"> You start nagging us we're pulling over to the side of the road kicking your ass out and picking you up later. </seg>
<seg id="683"> Agreed. Okay. Go work your magic. </seg>
<seg id="684"> - Hello sir. - Hello! - Hello. What's your name? - Jasper. </seg>
<seg id="685"> Hello Jasper. I'm Abernathy. - Aber... what? - Abernathy. </seg>
<seg id="686"> - What's your first name? - That is my first name. </seg>
<seg id="687"> What kind of first name is that? You know what? Just call me Abbie. Okay Abbie. </seg>
<seg id="688"> Jasper we were wondering if my friends and I could take the car out for a little test-drive out on our own. You know just to see if we're comfortable in it. </seg>
<seg id="689"> Why would I do something stupid like that? To better sell your automobile. </seg>
<seg id="690"> How do I know y'all ain't just gonna steal it? </seg>
<seg id="691"> Four reasons actually. One we're not thieves. Two that would be rude. Three we're staying at the Days lnn in town. </seg>
<seg id="692"> You can call the hotel check with management. We're registered for the next month. </seg>
<seg id="693"> Actually Zoë's not. But Kim and I are so we're totally track-downable. </seg>
<seg id="694"> Who's Kim? The colored girl? Yes. Kim would be the girl of color. </seg>
<seg id="695"> And reason number four and the most important while we're taking the car out for a little spin that'll give you a better opportunity to get acquainted with our other friend Lee. </seg>
<seg id="696"> Why does she look kind of familiar? </seg>
<seg id="697"> That would be because she's a famous actress. Oh. </seg>
<seg id="698"> Why is she dressed like that? Well you see we're making a Hollywood movie in town and it's a cheerleader movie and she's one of the cheerleaders. </seg>
<seg id="699"> What's a cheerleader movie? A movie about cheerleaders. </seg>
<seg id="700"> Is it a porno movie? Yes it is. </seg>
<seg id="701"> But don't mention it. She's shy. </seg>
<seg id="702"> Lee this is Jasper. Jasper Lee. </seg>
<seg id="703"> Now you two kids stay out of trouble. </seg>
<seg id="704"> Hey good-lookin' be back to pick you up later. </seg>
<seg id="705"> Ta-ta! </seg>
<seg id="706"> Gulp. </seg>

<seg id="714"> - Kim... - I'm just saying. </seg>
<seg id="715"> Look if you're gonna take the piss out of it. I'm just saying. </seg>
<seg id="716"> You wanna start out on top? </seg>

<seg id="718"> Here are your gloves. </seg>
<seg id="719"> No no no no. I'm wearing the jacket. This is my jacket. </seg>
<seg id="720"> Um ain't you 'posed to be my slave or some shit? </seg>

<seg id="722"> Y'all I think I hear a car coming! Give me your belt. Oh. </seg>
<seg id="723"> But this is my cute shit. - Well. - Fuck that. </seg>
<seg id="724"> Get Abernathy's belt. Fine. We'll use Abbie's belt. </seg>
<seg id="725"> - Give me your belt. - No. - Prada. - Come on give her the belt. Magic word. </seg>
<seg id="726"> Please give her the belt. Just 'cause you asked nicely. </seg>
<seg id="727"> - lt's nice to be nice Kim! - Whatever. </seg>
<seg id="728"> You know what? Don't even fucking think about asking me next time you want me to do your hair. </seg>
<seg id="729"> Your ass gonna do it. </seg>
<seg id="730"> Yeah and you'll ask "pretty please" bitch because that's what you do when no one else is looking. </seg>
<seg id="731"> You ain't that fucking hard. I ain't getting that shit. </seg>
