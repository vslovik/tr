1
Wait, wait!
2
I have to do a pisciata, the biggest pisciata in the world!
3
- So let's go! - Stay calm!
4
- Who has the stuff? - No one, if you do not have it.
5
- I was hoping to bring you. - Yeah, why do not you have the stuff? Holy Christ, Shanna, it's not my fucking job supplying you all the grass when we leave!
6
Brake, sir!
7
You get angry a little too fast. I was just teasing you.
8
But who gets angry ?! Perhaps it would be nice if you did not mind me all the fucking times and if you were surprised by bringing it to me every now and then!
9
Okay, you look bad in a kids movie. - Finish the whims? - I'm not doing the whims. - Yes, on the other hand!
10
You're in the car for two seconds and I swear!
11
I did not say swearing. Yeah, dear, you said, "Holy Christ, Shanna!"
12
And before finishing the sentence you put a "fuck" to emphasize your irritation. - All right, I buy it when we find it.
13
One: I'm not the money the problem, but the break of balls to go find the grass, and two: We are not arguing.
14
Arlene, have you forgotten that it means going around with Jungle Julia?
15
This is not arguing.
16
This is Julia who acts as a pesky bitch and I reproach and are indulgent at the same time.
17
So what we are after all these years.
18
Billboard!
19
So, what's the plan, beauty? - Margarita and Mexican food from Guero's.
20
- Did you call Rafael to tell him we're coming? - SÃƒÂ¬.
21
- How good are you! - I know!
22
We hear, tonight will also see Christian Simonson?
23
You can bet your ass, he comes with Jesse Letterman.
24
Christian Simonson, the director, is in the city!
25
- And he has a cake for Julia. "If he had a crush on me, he would call me instead of disappearing for 6 months and would move his ass more often to come here and make a phone call on my birthday.
26
Billboard!
27
Yeah, but if you try to put your beautiful legs on it, it's done.
28
Only when I'm going to sell her home on the hill where I will live, I'll call you to tell you it worked.
29
Then, Margarita and Mexican food from Guero's, hear Christian and Jesse, tell him later and make sure they come.
30
Others expect us to reach Texas Chili Parlor.
31
Fuck! About the others, what did you and Nate do last night?
32
What do you want to do? We just met, fuck!
33
If you do not slit the balls a while, when they respect you?
34
All right, it's clear what you did not do.
35
Why do not you enlighten us about what you did?
36
Just nothing special.
37
We kissed on the couch for 20 minutes.
38
Clothes, naked or nude?
39
Clothes! We kissed, we did not do "the fact".
40
Sorry if I break the balls, but what would be the "fact"?
41
- "The fact" would be all the rest. - And you call it "the fact"?
42
- I call it "the fact". - Do you guys like that call it "the fact"?
43
Surely more than the "no".
44
Okay, now I want to go back to what you did.
45
"You and Nate kissed on the couch. - That's right. - At home or at your hotel? - Do you look like a scum? From me!
46
Did you sit or lie down on the couch?
47
We started sitting and then lying down.
48
- Mh! The game is tough! Who was on it? - I'm riding.
49
- Nothing else? "We kissed some more on the couch, then I said," Now I have to go to bed, so you have to go. "
50
And he began to cry: "Right now?"
51
And I: "Yeah, right now, go away." And he: "I make a proposal for you."
52
And I: "No," and he: "Why do not you, you do not know what I mean."
53
And I: "I know what you mean and the answer is no."
54
And he: "How do you know what I mean?"
55
And I: "You are about to say, 'we can sleep together, we do nothing,' '' just two cuddles, we sleep near, tomorrow we wake up together. ' "No, you go now and tomorrow morning we'll see you."
56
Frighten by Nate! It's cute!
57
For me, Jesse Letterman drowned her all night.
58
- Jesse Letterman? - Remember, you can not tow tonight.
59
If you go, you can come out afterwards, you can kiss them but do not bring them down because we have to go to Lake LBJ tonight and my dad has been clear on one thing, he said:
60
"Tonight I will allow you and your dear friends to stay at my home on the lake," not to you and to the twisted boys "who want to fuck my daughter."
61
- You talk so? - SÃƒÂ¬. - Here!
62
And there is not even a way to hide it because every time I'm at the lake with my girlfriends and we're in bikini, look at pop falls to see if there's nothing left to it!
63
- Girls, it's totally harmless and cute like an insect's ear!
64
But when he knows that there are a bunch of nudes that sneak in his home to the lake, he likes to come and check if there is nothing missing.
65
And if you foolishly make the thread, just like our giraffe here behind, win a puppy for a lifetime.
66
I have a whole relationship with Ben and you are jealous because he does not include you.
67
- Do you call his dad Ben? - Of course I'm not a little girl.
68
- Boys when they see you? - We meet at the Chili Parlor.
69
- Maybe they take some grass - not even for fucking.
70
I do not want to, A, depend on those cackles, n, B, get rid of those cats. If we do not find it, we're stuck with them all the fuck in the evening.
71
- Let's try with Lanna Frank. - This one is an idea, good.
72
Look, your last bill before Guero's!
73
What balls, you got me stew!
74
What a fucking ball! We had said "every time". - All right.
75
- Julia, I finish it. - Thank you.
76
- Hello. - Hello.
77
- Are you sitting with us? - Second one, they're with friends.
78
Oh! You must be the infamous Butterfly.
79
Shhh! Zitta, she still does not know anything!
80
- Nothing about it? - And when do you tell her? - Then!
81
- Thing? - Thank you, we'll have to tell you more then.
82
Bitch! What the fuck's going on?
83
Today on the radio I said something about you live.
84
Julia, tell me what fuck you said about me on the radio.
85
I just said that a friend named Butterfly came to see me for the weekend and we'd be going around Austin tonight and if anyone was in the area we could meet you and I described how you did and said that if someone was watching you in the city, then if you did one thing, you would have done one thing.
86
Julia, am I serious, what did you say and what did you say I would do?
87
Let's just say so: I could say what I said, but it would be boring, or Marcy here, being an amazing actress, could play it for us, which would give you a more accurate idea of ​​what we have in store for you tonight .
88
- Okay, tell me how you like. - Do we play Marcy? - Sure!
89
- Give Marcy your glass. - Thank you.
90
So you are in a bar or in a bar and Marcy is a cute, very sexy, very sexy guy, or maybe a boy to die for, but not funny.
91
- Anyway, it's one you picked up. - Clear. - Go, Marcy, it's up to you.
92
EhilÃƒÂ ...
93
How are you?
94
Sorry, but are not you what's called Butterfly, by chance?
95
- Yeah, right. And if you tell me your name, let's down. - Barry.
96
- Very pleased, Barry. - Get me excited! Shhh!
97
Listen, and ... Butterfly is your real name?
98
Yeah, sure. And how do you know my name, Barry?
99
I heard Jungle Julia broadcast this morning.
100
- Are you listening to him? Really! - Yeah, I hear it every morning.
101
- Every morning, but come on! - Yeah, Julia is the most pompous woman in the city.
102
- Do not you think your ass is a little bigger in your opinion? - No, shit.
103
My ass looks like me a lot.
104
What you find is a nice black ass.
105
It's what she always says, but the truth that she does not have a nice black ass at all, she only has two huge lashes. - What the fuck are you talking about ?!
106
- What do I say? I'm going to go, darling. - Okay, let's go:
107
For your information, shit shit, lots of blacks, and lots of white bastards if I've spared a world to worship my ass.
108
I still have the marks of their teeth on my back.
109
- If you do not offer me a drink, did I give up my glass? - Well, okay, okay.
110
"Then, Butterfly, do we have a drink?" - With extreme pleasure. - What are we doing? - What about a Margarita?
111
Eccotelo.
112
After they have offered you to drink and raise your glass for a toast, you have to look right in your eyes and repeat this poem: "The forest is magnificent, deep in dusk" and I promise to keep "" miles away to go before sleeping ".
113
Did you hear, Butterfly?
114
"Miles to go before sleeping".
115
So if they tell you this, you have to do a lap dance. - That?!
116
If they call you Butterfly, they offer you drink and say poetry, you do a lap dance! - Fanculo! I do nothing! You can do it or not, but if you do not, here in Austin you think you're a cacassotto, and I do not think you want someone to think about it.
117
I do not just lap dance because you said that.
118
- Come on, it's funny! - It's funny if these shit touches me!
119
Look, you do not have to do it to anyone, if you do not.
120
I said you would have done it to the first one who says poetry, so if somebody comes to you to make a fig, tell him that you've done it before in another place.
121
No harm, no problem, and we also remedies for free drinking. But maybe tonight, a little later, when you have drunk a bit, you feel relaxed, safe between your friends ... If a cute, very sexy, sexy, spicy guy dies, but not funny look and tell you poetry, maybe you did it before or maybe you did not.
122
Lanna Frank, where are you? - Fuck this, that's a good question!
123
Lanna Frank! Where are you?
124
Come here, we're waiting for you.
125
Fuck! Wait.
126
Where are you?
127
All right, come on, we're waiting for you.
128
Forget it, we do not come to you. Come on, as you said.
129
- How's the story, Shauna and the girls at the lake on the weekend? - Shauna?
130
Oh! Shit, I ...
131
No! There is only one thing that girls from all over the world who call themselves Shanna have in common with each other: We share the name Shauna and hate the people who call us so.
132
Do not forget, I'm Shanna Banana, not Shauna Banona.
133
Yeah, but before my crap my cock was climbing?
134
Yeah, not really up there, but ...
135
- Guys, Warren sends you a shot. You know the rules of the house:
136
If he sends the shot, you need to get them. - Why? - Hey, that's the rules, baby. Warren says, we do.
137
How I love this philosophy: Warren says, we do.
138
- Then, guys, let's do it! - SÃƒÂ¬. - What's the matter?
139
Zitta, first drinks, then questions. Get the horses off!
140
Ah!
141
Ah!
142
Is it a fantastic thing or is not it a fantastic thing?
143
But what the fucking stuff is?
144
Chartreuse, the only liqueur so good that has given its name to a color.
145
Who is ready for dos Chartreuse?
146
Too much. I'm going out to get a cigarette.
147
Do not get too close to the lighter, huh?
148
- Drink that we bring you? - Shanna Banana?
149
Another Long lsland ice tea giant.
150
Bombay Sapphire tonic, no ice. Strong, huh? But good kids!
151
Plate, one of the parking lights is off. Why do not you light it up?
152
- Ah! - Oh! - Jesus Christ!
153
I'm fucking scared, you're a big dick!
154
I swear, Arlene, I did not want to scare you.
155
- I only had a great luck. - What the fuck! - Let's go inside. - Wait. - Why? - Why do not we give a nice kiss? Where, here? Are you stupid? Not even at the bar, in front of the entrance?
156
- No, in my car. - LÃ¤ out?
157
- Rain that seems to be in Vietnam. - In the car it does not rain.
158
Look, I do not get you wet. I can assure you.
159
It is the first time I feel a man boast of this.
160
Ah, ah, ah! You know what I meant.
161
Since you go to Lake LBJ and that we can not come, let us give a kiss! - Yeah, but stop crying.
162
You make me even more crap.
163
Okay, but I do not want him to know all the damn bar, so we go in the car and kiss for exactly 6 minutes, are you?
164
- Sure. - No, no, are you or not?
165
If you start to rush when I leave after 6 minutes, it's better to go back to the bar right away. - I'm in. Do not fry.
166
- And do not pray. - And do not pray. When you say "finished" it's over.
167
Looks like I remember it. Let's go.
168
You have two tasks: Kiss well and do not wet my hair.
169
You do not have to try to take it away before Christian Simonson arrives.
170
You have to take her away before Christian Simonson arrives!
171
That changes? They are from Shanna's father and the kids are absolutely forbidden.
172
Then, having brought the girls to drink, in quick succession but without pointing to us, we order two more rounds of shot. - Do you think they're scolding you?
173
We will be very convincing. And it is time to raise the volume. We play heavy, we go to JÃƒÂ © germeister.
174
What the fuck are you saying? Women do not drink JÃƒÂ¤ germeister.
175
As long as a male pays for a drink, a whore will drink anything.
176
Let's get off at least a lap of JÃƒÂ¤ germeister in those gorges.
177
And then let's see if they do another.
178
You never know, they might say, "Who cares?"
179
And then "no kids at the lake home" becomes "two guys at the lake home". - That's right.
180
You will see that Shanna will suck the banana and get a Buttery Nipple.
181
- Does Julia like sweet liquor like? - Key Lime Pie. What a fucking shit! No one resists a sweet liqueur.
182
Fuck! Look at that, it looks BJ. What if he also brought the monkey.
183
Jesus Christ!
184
That guy got scared by falling from the time machine.
185
Warren, do you give me a chicken soup for Stroker Ace, please?
186
Where were you two? - I got something in the car. Nate accompanied me with her umbrella and I did not get wet.
187
- Good for you, Nate! - You see that pretty girl alone at the counter?
188
- Who, the poor hippie? - Meow! It's not a hippie.
189
It has the hippie air.
190
You're a treasure, Timmy. Well, you know what happened to her?
191
No, but I know it's a dry bun with her dyed hair.
192
Did you want to tell her story? What happened to her?
193
Warren? Do I recommend someone here to make a pass?
194
My lady, my carriage is her. What are you doing, ears?
195
There is "eavesdropping" and "impossible to hear". I think I belong to the second category.
196
If I understand, Icy Hot, do you offer me a tear?
197
I'm offering you a tear, if when I leave, you're ready too.
198
- And when do you think you're going away? - I'm not really thinking about it.
199
But as soon as I do, you'll be the first to know.
200
And will you be able to drive afterwards?
201
I know the appearances deceive, but I really are timid.
202
I did not drink tonic water and lime all night, and now I'm preparing for my big cocktail.
203
- That would? - Virgin Pina Colada.
204
Okay, why does a person who does not drink alcohol spend hours in a bar drinking almost water?
205
A bar offers a mountain of things beyond the alcohol.
206
Mh! You say? Eg?
207
Women. A plate of Nacho Grande. The company of several fascinating individuals like Warren, for example. I love it.
208
Alcohol is just the lubricant for the encounters that a bar can offer.
209
- What, cowboy philosophy? - I'm not a cowboy, Pam.
210
I'm a stuntman. But it is a very, very easy mistake to make.
211
How do you know my name?
212
When you talked to Warren, I could not hear it.
213
There may be. And how do you call me, Icy?
214
- Stuntman Mike. - Stuntman Mike is your name?
215
Ask him who you want.
216
- Warren, who is this here? - Stuntman Mike!
217
- Ah! And who the fuck is Stuntman Mike? - A stuntman.
218
We're there, Pam. It's the moment of my big cocktail.
219
Well, Stuntman Mike, since I have an open account here, can I offer you Pina Colada non-alcoholic?
220
"No doubt, Pam, very pleased. - Warren?
221
A Virgin Pina Colada for my friend stuntman
222
and for me another Cadillac Cabo Wabo Margarita.
223
Cabo Wabo, Virgin.
224
That table seems to have sucked all your attention. - That girl's the billboard out here? - SÃƒÂ¬. There is nothing to say, it's a beautiful girl.
225
We have jin, tequila, whiskey ...
226
- And what hair! - Embalmed, all balm.
227
- Do I have some jealousy or badness? - It's wrong.
228
If you want to get involved with Jungle Julia, there's a very simple way, you know? - Seriously? - Ah. ah.
229
- And what would that be? - To be famous.
230
Even if you do not look for it, they'll find you.
231
And it is better that you do not know what he did for that billboard.
232
To yours, sucker. 'Fuck!
233
What will I ever do to you?
234
We went to school together, from kindergarten to high school.
235
That's what he did to me.
236
It was high as well as 12 years old! It was a giant, a monster!
237
Half of the boys still broke today, at school kicking them and terrorizing them.
238
I see. Did she even give you and rub the chocolate milk?
239
That Godzilla bitches? I'll kick a couple of times.
240
I am a girl, not a nice nerone, but not to give in to Julia Lucai, I would have been killed.
241
Hello! You look like a famous one.
242
- Do you look like that? - No, no, seriously.
243
- Do a little bit, what are you doing? - Seriously?
244
I put my ass on to take off my record label.
245
But why that girl wanted my picture, it's because I'm a DJ zone.
246
Wait a moment.
247
- There's a billboard in front of Big Kahuna Burger, right? - SÃƒÂ¬. There is one here too, Zatoichi. GiÃƒÂ!
248
- Jungle Julia Lucai. - Stuntman Mike McKay. - Good!
249
Pleased to meet you, Stuntman Mike.
250
Now, sorry, but I and my friends are still doing this. Want a shot?
251
Thanks, Julia. As if I had accepted, but no, thank you.
252
- As you want. - You know that...
253
Porca troia!
254
Sorry, nothing.
255
But what the hell is that?
256
- And that's what I did!
257
What a nice guarantor you have!
258
I asked him what movies you did and he said he did not know a fuck.
259
Technically I do not know if he really did anything.
260
He once made me see a "On Arizona's borders", there was one who fell from horseback, saying he was him.
261
Do you know the "Virginian" show?
262
- SÃƒÂ¬. "There was another actor on that show, Gary Clarke, and I looked a little like him.
263
Obviously before I cut myself while I was shaving.
264
For me it's sexy!
265
Do you know you're so sweet that you make sugar look like salt?
266
Anyway, I did "The Virgin" as a counterpart to Gary Clarke.
267
And when they made the second set, Lee Majors came and I also made his own stand-up.
268
From there, I specialize in car accidents.
269
Yeah, I did almost all the third series of "Vegas".
270
I was the contingent of Robert Urich.
271
Then Bob made another series, "Gavilan", and he also brought me to that, so far, well ...
272
After that...
273
At least one of these series I just named, you know that?
274
- Not even one. - I'm sorry. - No.
275
Wait, explain a little. How is one becoming a stuntman, Stuntman Mike?
276
In Hollywood all those who are so stupid to throw themselves down the stairs, find one who pays them to do so.
277
But I did not go around like everyone else doing stunts. - CioÃ¨? - My brother helped me. - Who is your brother? - Stuntman Bob.
278
- I'm ready to play. - Go, get it back.
279
- We have a few laps of advantage. - Let the party begin! - SÃƒÂ¬.
280
Anyway I'm sorry. Do you want to forgive me?
281
But you'll have to be pretty with me for as long as I'm in town.
282
- Promised. Ready to go to the lake? - Mh-mh.
283
- Want to bring your friend? - You said only women. If you do, Shanna will not have any problems. What do you want to do?
284
- Even men or women alone? - Only women. - Good idea.
285
Lord ...
286
- Thank you. - Health, Butterfly.
287
"The forest is magnificent, deep in dusk". "And I've promised to keep miles and miles before going to sleep."
288
Did you hear me, Butterfly?
289
"Miles to go before sleeping".
290
- I'm sorry, Stuntman Burt. - Mike.
291
- Mike. The dances are over. - ÃƒÃ † la veritÃƒÂ?
292
So, I missed my chance.
293
Do I scare you?
294
For the scar?
295
- For the car. - Yeah, I know, sorry.
296
It's the mother's car.
297
- What did you do, are you crazy? - No! But that's what I like about Austin, which is so damn small.
298
- Have you seen him yet? - I saw him out of Guero's.
299
Yeah, I also saw you out of Guero's.
300
You saw my car and I got your legs.
301
I'm not kidding you, but I do not want to eat you for that.
302
- Do you think you really believe it? - I'm not following you, Butterfly.
303
I've been lucky.
304
Then? What do you do with our lap dance?
305
I'm sorry, the offer was saying "once only", and she has already made it out of Anthony's.
306
- It's not true. - What do you know about it?
307
I'm good at certain things. And you have the air a little touch.
308
- What does "touch" mean? - Sore throat.
309
- Why should I be hurt? "Because you were expecting people to torment you all night, but from your gaze I would say that nobody has tormented you. And this hurt your feelings a bit. Few things are as fascinating as the ego wounded by a beautiful angel.
310
Then? What do you do with our lap dance?
311
You will have to book for the next time.
312
But since it's part of a couple of days, I do not think we'll be there next time.
313
But he does not do anything.
314
I can see if my presence embarrasses you.
315
You are, however, a pretty girl and I like it.
316
I need to tell you something, though.
317
Do you know what people say?
318
"You are filed, I've got you now," or "I've got you in the archives now."
319
Well, let me have a phone book here. And all those I know are in this section.
320
And now I've met you and you also end up in the phone book.
321
Yeah, but I'm afraid I'll have to put you under the word "cacasotto".
322
What if I do it?
323
Then I could not put you under the word "cacasotto", what do you say?
324
- How did you say you called? - Stuntman Mike.
325
Well, Mike Stuntman, I'm Butterfly and my friend Jungle Julia says the jukebox is very much stocked.
326
- Yeah, he's right. - Eh, yes.
327
Why do not you go prepare for your lap dance?
328
I said, "A cute, very sexy, sexy guy," "lousy, but not funny, which, let's say, you picked up." Then you did not understand anything.
329
Tonight is fucking old Mike.
330
"With the years he has, he might be my father. - I still feel, darling.
331
Hello. Bye Bye.
332
- Fuck, she's really scared! - Yeah, I wanted something awesome.
333
Fear tends to impress.
334
- And is it safe? - No, it's more than safe. It's a death proof.
335
How do you make a dead-end machine? Well, it's the job of a stuntman. Do you see those movies where the machines make accidents that nobody could get out of?
336
- SÃƒÂ¬. - And how do you realize them?
337
At the PC?
338
Yes, sadly, Pam, today most of the time is as you say.
339
But at the time or nothing, at the time of "Zero Point", "Zozza Mary, crazy Gary", of "Violence on the Highway", real cars fluttered against real machines, with real idiots driving them.
340
At that time, you gave the stunt the car you wanted to smash, they reinforced that bastard everywhere and voilÃƒÂ¤, they drove out a beautiful dead-end machine.
341
It does not look like shit, I did not know there were dead-end machines.
342
I can crumble it into a brick wall going 200 kilometers an hour, just to see that it does.
343
Fuck, but here the passenger puts it in box, why?
344
Because it's a movie car. Sometimes when an accident occurs, the filmmaker puts us the camera to film the incident from the inside.
345
And here's the room, it's called "crash box". Here it is.
346
Have a seat.
347
When you asked me to accompany you, you did not say you did not have the place to go by car.
348
Truly, I did not ask you to accompany you. You asked me for a walk and I said yes. Look at the positive side: I can not try putting one hand on my knee. Yeah, it's the only positive side.
349
I knew it.
350
"Then, Pam, where do you go, left or right?" - Right. - It's a pity. - Why?
351
Because there was 50% of the possibilities to go left as right.
352
We, on the other hand, will go both to the left. You could have chosen to go to the left and it would take a while to start scaring.
353
But since you're on the other side, I'm afraid you'll have to start afraid immediately.
354
Fuck you ?!
355
Stronzo succulent, bastard! Get me out of here!
356
I break your car! Stop this fucking machine!
357
Okay ... Look ... I understand.
358
It's all a joke. It's too funny.
359
But please, let me get down. I hurt myself. I do not tell anyone, I swear to you. I know it's a joke.
360
Please, I promise I will not tell anyone.
361
- Let me down, please. - Hey, Pam!
362
Do you remember when I said the car was deadly?
363
It was not a lie.
364
This machine is 100% dead-end.
365
But to enjoy this advantage, darling, you should be sitting exactly where I am.
366
And now it's the turn of my other friendly friends.
367
No, no, no, I'm Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich.
368
You got it? Thanks, honey. You put it right now, right?
369
Great.
370
Wow!
371
Bye Bye.
372
- What do you want to hear? - Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick and Tich.
373
- Who? - Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick and Tich.
374
- And who the fuck are they? - For your information, Pete Townshend at some point was about to leave the Who and if he did, he would end up in this group, so they would become Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick, Tich, and Pete. It was better if he went there. Yeah, he got us! More, make me feel stronger!
375
Did not see anything?
376
No, I do not remember.
377
Dr. Davis in the clinic.
378
Tell me, what is the patient's prognosis, Dr. Block?
379
- I do not think they are his business. - Come on, sister, just say enough.
380
How bad is it?
381
That type is beautifully ruined: Broken nose, broken teeth, broken clavicle, and the left index is also rubbed. - Is it still alive?
382
He was lucky.
383
- Need anything else? - No, it's more than enough. Thank you, Dr. Block.
384
Son of a bitch!
385
- So, daddy, what do you think? - You know, son number one, what I think is a damned macabre that I can say aloud.
386
- Try it anyway, pa. - We have a case of vehicle murder.
387
Our old man killed those pretty girls.
388
He used a car and not a hatch, but they were dead too.
389
- What are you going to do, huh? - They will not do anything, damn it!
390
The prosecutor says there is no crime.
391
Each of those poor girls was swimming in the alcohol, fluctuating in the grass, and the old Hooper of lÃƒÂ, instead, is cleaned like a lamb.
392
But you are sure? Do you really think he killed those girls?
393
I can not prove it. But since thinking does not cost anything, I can think so, so I think so.
394
Yeah, but he's too bad.
395
Yeah, it's bad, but damn it, those pretty girls seemed to chew and then spit out a fucking giant.
396
- How come no one survived? - Fuck!
397
Two tons of metal, flesh and bone, and old dear Newton. How did the fuck survive?
398
PerchÃƒÂ ©?
399
See, I can assume it's a sex thing.
400
There can not be anything else.
401
Impact at high speed, twisted plates, broken glasses, four souls taken at the same instant.
402
Perhaps just so, the degenerate man can shoot his gelatinous stuff.
403
We can only accuse that carburetor of a car driver with that box of death, that is, the old dear public corruption.
404
But a damned bartender has come over who will testify that Stuntman Mike did not drink all evening and that his passenger had been relieved by his boyfriend in a damn rain and asked her for a walk.
405
On paper, he looks like he wants to give her a hand.
406
- So, so he'll see the jury. - So what do you do, huh?
407
I could only work on the case in the free hours.
408
Look for evidence, demonstrate theory, whatever it is, and become the torment of that sullen son of a bitch.
409
Wherever he goes, I go. Or I could commit the same amount of time and energy to follow the NASCAR circuit, son. Yeah, I'd love a lot.
410
And I would be much happier if I chose the second.
411
And just because I can not punish that Frankenstein for what he did, I tell you, as the Lord told John, that if he were to do it again, I'm sure he will not be here in Texas.
412
- Were you on the same plane? - I'm 4th and he's 7th.
413
- Who in the room? - In my.
414
- Then what happened? - We kissed him in the lobby for 10 minutes and then I sent him to his room. - And how does this rock kiss this Rock? You do not know what a good one it is! It has soft lips, all to bite.
415
- I love the soft lips! - Then it's really big, he turned me and he put me back and with his huge mannea touched my throat, he took my head back, he bent over me and kissed me from behind.
416
- Fuck, it looks exciting! - Mh, it was exciting.
417
And then nothing else? Did you send it away?
418
- How did he get it? - But why are we stopping here?
419
If I have to drive to take Zoe at the airport, I need a coffee bean! "Since you go to the bar, do you still get vodka and some sugar-free Red Bulls?"
420
- You did not realize you were awake. - It's so, I sleep.
421
Remember: Vodka, a few Red Bulls without sugar and the Red Apple Tans.
422
- What a fuck! Mica I stopped to make you the expense!
423
- Do you know how to get to the airport? - Sure.
424
Then put yourself in the wheel, because after you drive.
425
What a bastard!
426
They do not have Red Bull without sugar. Only normal or G.O. juice unsweetened.
427
- Cazzo, G.O. - Mr.O!
428
Where the fuck are the keys? Ah, here it is.
429
That bastards! I did not wanna wake you.
430
You have nothing to do with it. That jerk hit my foot as it passed.
431
I do not know, it made me shiver.
432
Prick.
433
Sure.
434
Since I'm awake, I take some money at the ATM and make a nice cigarette.
435
- Fuck you? - You saw that ... - What? Nothing honey.
436
- Ready? - It's me! - Are you missing out?
437
It's better to take your butt off Kim's car.
438
- She too sat down before that. - His butts are not yours.
439
All right.
440
I should be on the number this month of Allure.
441
- Do you have Allure? - The magazines near the window.
442
Here you are!
443
You're a real bastard.
444
Arrive right away.
445
And they are 16 and 15 of the rest. Thank you and goodbye.
446
I have other fashion magazines for sale in the back.
447
No, I'm not interested. That's enough.
448
- Just for information. - Thanks anyway. - Good day.
449
Look behind that I also have Italian Vogue.
450
Of this month?
451
This is what I have to tell.
452
The Circle A boy has the number of this month's Italian Vogue.
453
- I can not believe! - Strange but true.
454
How could they have it?
455
In fact they do not have it. Sell ​​his personal copy.
456
- It's worth $ 27. - $ 27?
457
What are your problems? It's like our shit shit.
458
I found a number of Italian Vogue in Lebanon, Tennesse, and he does not ask Krugerrand to pay for it. I take it and divide it into three parts.
459
- I, you and Kim? - No, Kim does not give a fuck to Italian Vogue.
460
But Brandy will participate. And if not you, Tyson, the assistant.
461
Okay, but if someone rips one of the pages I want, I do the color photocopies, and not in any copier, take her to the scenery department and the photocopies for good.
462
I do the trick to Lindsey Lohan and she will miss for three days. For now there are no scenes with stunts, so Kim is free, and Lee is available for the next four days.
463
- And how did they go? - Great big.
464
We have a lot of fun. The director, Cecil Evans, is very sympathetic.
465
- The movie is really cool and there are parties every night. - Sure.
466
It is true, they will surely hunt down the job after this.
467
Then, ladies, we talk about adventures. Who does stuff?
468
- I'll talk about Lee and Tool. - Eh? - Oh, tool!
469
- The name promises good. - It's a gunner!
470
- It's really a pervert. - It's getting more and more interesting.
471
What is its perversion?
472
Look at me as I do the pipÃƒÂ¬.
473
Lee goes to the cup and Tool looks at her pissing.
474
Tiky. Tiky. Tiky. You!
475
Yeah, but now no more. Now she's doing it with The Rock.
476
Are you fuckin 'The Rock ?! Not really The Rock, an electrician named Bruce.
477
Kim calls it The Rock because it looks like The Rock and now we all call it The Rock. - It's a pseudo-star crew.
478
There is one equal to Nicolas Cage and one that resembles Pee-Wee Herman.
479
Kim, the cockpit department how are you?
480
No cocks this round. Now I have a companion.
481
- How long have you got this companion? Almost 3 months.
482
- To whom did you frighten him? - I did not rub it! - Kim! - Well? Everyone knows they had a girlfriend.
483
Nothing new, all Kim's boys are the boys of another.
484
Girls, I did not rub it. And I have never frustrated anyone, they are they disappearing!
485
And what about your hands, Abernathy?
486
Abbie has the big Kahuna in her hands.
487
- I had a cook for Cecil on the set. - Cotta on the set? But please! On the set you were like his wife.
488
"I had" and "were" the keywords.
489
You are still both taken, do not bury.
490
If she is so in love with me, why does she shoot Daryl Hannah's counterpart?
491
Yeah, men are bitches. Is not that fun?
492
- ÃƒÃ † cosÃƒÂ¬ fun! - Do not do what's wrong with us. - You're just fucking your ass. - It's just a fucking counterpart.
493
Beautiful, you have to overcome this shit. It was 2 weeks ago.
494
Sure, if you put it this way ...
495
I did not tell you the best part: If it's fucked up at my birthday.
496
- Then this changes things. - Thank you.
497
Did you know it was your party? The directors are always so busy.
498
He ate a slice of my birthday cake and brought me a present. Yeah, I'd say he knew that. - Cabbage! What gift did you do?
499
He made me a cassette.
500
- Did you make a cassette? - SÃƒÂ¬. - Ah!
501
- You did not burn a CD, did you make a cassette? - SÃƒÂ¬. - What a romantic thing! - I know what you're saying, so it's useless to find out. - For me it's a great demonstration of love.
502
Feel it, I know you like it. Yeah, it's cool. But she's fucked another woman on my birthday.
503
How do you not stay on my side?
504
- That's right, it looks like a bad thing. - It's a shit!
505
But below is there any other reason?
506
- You two fucked? - Of course not.
507
- Sorry, you call Abernathy? - Sorry.
508
The answer to your question is: No, of course not.
509
What does "No, of course not" mean?
510
The reason why Cecil does not have a fixed girl for six years is because the girls are fucked. And if you are Cecil, do not become one of her girls.
511
I do not say why I want to be her girlfriend, but if I wanted to be and I was fucked up, now I would not be her girlfriend, I would be one of her stories.
512
And I'm getting a bit old for shit.
513
- You did not do anything at all? - Of course he does.
514
I made a foot massage and when we went to the movie, I let him hold his hand on his knees.
515
Bella, you behave like a twelve-year-old, he's acting like a man. Let it smell at least!
516
- Let's say things like they are: You do not aim for it. - No. - Do not blow it. - No. - You do not even hear him. - No. But the counterpart of Daryl Hannah does. Can we close the discussion on my sexual life?
517
Truly the discussion was about Cecil's sex life, your treasure is nonexistent.
518
I cry to both of you and your humor.
519
Before claiming a big dick, darling, you have to deserve it, the dick. You can start by making a nice saw in his trailer bag Tuesday.
520
- They will not! - I know you will not do it, but you know who will do it?
521
The whore who will eventually live with him in his huge villa.
522
Feel, I'm not entirely in agreement with Kim, but it's also true that if you've kept it like you say with Cecil and suddenly you start to bite, you blow your brain!
523
Zoe, Kim and I were in the Philippines at a rave outdoors.
524
- What movie? - "Three Heads in Head # 3".
525
To put it all, we were all three lost. - SÃƒÂ¬!
526
- Go. - Let's go.
527
Health.
528
Then, Zoe, the genius comes up to take a picture of me.
529
You do not see a fuck, it's dark to die.
530
She is with the car in her hand and says: "Go a little further." And I'm going. Then: "Another little." And I'll go back a bit. Then: "Another little." And I'm moving.
531
I realize I'm on the edge of a 2-meter-high concrete ditch, with inside a mountain of shit, stones, broken bottles, and giant mice. And if I was in that suck, I could break the bone of my neck.
532
Then I start shouting: "Zoe, fuck, you just did not kill me!"
533
We start laughing like crazy, we walk a little bit and Zoe starts to crawl and disappears. Do you know where it was going? Within that fucking ditch.
534
- Good good. - Thank you, thank you very much.
535
I remember taking a step and looking down and meanwhile, I thought, "This is the ditch that Abbie said." - Yeah! I'm plunged in. - And what did he do?
536
Are you talking about Zoe, the cat? Anything.
537
If I fell down, they would pull me out with a teaspoon.
538
Zoe fell perfectly to his feet.
539
But then I reflected on me and I was a little depressed.
540
Zoe ends up in that ditch and nothing is done.
541
In fact, we laugh over it.
542
If I was finished I would be paralyzed.
543
You can not reason like that.
544
Each of us owns his talent, that's Zoe's talent.
545
Of course. If we talk about physics, Zoe is great. Agility, reflexes, looseness ...
546
- Few human beings flip Zoe on that forehead. - Kim, I love you!
547
That said, before you become too envious of Zoe's ability, you did not understand the most important part of the story.
548
You did not fall into the moat. Zoe sÃƒÂ¬.
549
Zoe even knew that there was a ditch because you told him, and the same thing fell.
550
So Lee is right: We all have a lot of talent. - Why does not it look like a compliment?
551
Kim, do you always have Roscoe?
552
- Look here, slut. - Oh! I love it. - Me too.
553
- Fuck is Roscoe? - The Roscoe is a gun.
554
- Do you have a gun? - Ah-ah.
555
- And you have permission to have it? - SÃƒÂ¬.
556
When I was a secret service agent I was given one.
557
I did not know you were ...
558
Okay, I did not tell you, okay? Just look at me, I did not say it. God!
559
- Did you know he had it? - SÃƒÂ¬. Do you want to know if I agree? No.
560
Did I know that? SÃƒÂ¬.
561
I do not know in what futuristic utopia you live, but in the world in which I live this bullshit serves.
562
But you can not deny that today who has a gun tends to be killed far more than anyone who does not have it.
563
And you can not deny that, as I often go to my laundry room at midnight, I can risk my ass!
564
- Why do not you try to do it before? 'Fuck! I do the laundry when my dick goes to laundry.
565
There are other things you can use instead of a gun: pepper spray.
566
If an asshole tries to violate me, I do not want to irritate the skin.
567
I want to kill him!
568
Why do not you bring a knife?
569
Do you know what happens to knives with the knife?
570
They fired at him.
571
Look, if one day they're going to become a famous actress, they will not take the gun.
572
I'll pay a niggard for a gang and bring him the iron.
573
If anything happens, I'll be watching, but until then I'm in war.
574
So, Zoe, did you think what you want to do?
575
Yeah, girls, I know exactly.
576
Really? And what the fuck do you want to do?
577
It would not make sense for me to stay in America without driving a muscle car.
578
I want to drive a Dodge Challenger, enjoy the way and go to the ball!
579
We can ask the car department of the movie. - Must a Dodge Challenger work? - And that's not enough.
580
It must be a 70's Dodge Challenger with 440 engine.
581
And how dare you do that?
582
Quiet, beauty, I've arranged everything.
583
When I decided to come, I went online and found out that the local newspaper here in Tennesse is the Lebanon News Sentinel.
584
And at my home ... - Sorry, where do you live? Australian?
585
- What do you mean by that? - Zoe is a New Zealander. You never have to, never say, give a Australian Kiwi.
586
Unless you want to take a lot of wood.
587
I did not know, I'm sorry ...
588
Be quiet, we're just taking your ass.
589
Auckland, to answer your question.
590
Anyway, I subscribed to the newspaper a month ago.
591
But why? What do you need a cafe magazine in New Zealand?
592
If you close that mouthpiece, I try to tell you.
593
I read the newspaper all month and checked ads looking for machines for sale.
594
So just yesterday, right here in this city, there is one willing to sell a Dodge Challenger in the 1970s with a 440 engine painted in white.
595
And how the fuck do you buy it?
596
Maybe I'm stupid, but I'm not yet reincarnated.
597
I mean that maybe I buy it, so it makes me a test drive.
598
What reminds you of a white 70's Dodge Challenger?
599
- Kowalski! - "Punto Zero" Kowalski, slut slut!
600
That movie is a classic. If I get that asshole to drive me alone, with the open doors I fly that bastard!
601
What's "Zero Point"? How, what's Zero Point?
602
Abbie, I always do the part of the ignorant.
603
It is one of the best American movies of all time!
604
Truly, Zoe, many girls do not know "Zero Point".
605
Sorry, did you tell many girls? And what the fuck would you be?
606
Yeah, but we're car fanatics, so we saw it.
607
You grew up looking at "Beautiful in pink."
608
- I like "Belle in pink".
609
- Here you see? Why did not you look at John Hughes's movies?
610
I was looking at them. I'm a female, me.
611
But I also looked at all those on the engines.
612
"Zero Point", "Zozza Mary, Crazy Gary," "Out in 60 Seconds."
613
The true one. Not that shit that Angelina Jolie did.
614
In Auckland there is an open-air cinema that makes "Punto Zero", "A Merry Christmas", in short all the classics. It's a shame!
615
What the fuck do you play? What do you want? Is she selling a 70's Dodge Challenger?
616
For this, princesses.
617
Fuck this, it's an absolute hack!
618
Mythical, absolutely mythical!
619
It's a real fairy tale. I apologize only for a moment, I would like to speak privately with my members.
620
Take it easy, ladies.
621
What are you waiting for? Ask him if he is driving you. - Now I'm talking to you, but first I have to ask you something. - Thing?
622
If he lets us take the sun, I want to rethink the Ship's Mast. - Fuck, no! - Lower your voice!
623
Forgive me for Ship's Mast.
624
- Jesus Christ! - Do not blaspheme. - Sorry.
625
So, what did you say last time?
626
- I know what I said. - What did you say?
627
- We did not have to do it anymore. - No, you did not say "we did not have to."
628
You said, "We will never do it anymore." - SÃƒÂ¬, ma. - "But," a fuck, Zoe.
629
You said that we would never have done that fucking game and that if I had tried to do what you wanted to do, I had to refuse, and I also had permission to physically prevent you from doing so, did you understand? Did you say it or did not you tell her?
630
- Ma. - No, no. Reply, ugly bitch!
631
- Did you say it or did not you tell her? - Yeah, I told you. Anyway ... I cry for you and "anyway".
632
Okay, I know I said that and I know I was serious.
633
- Yeah, you were serious. - Yeah, but I did not mean to do it in America.
634
- But please! - Yeah, it's real, fuck.
635
I meant we no longer had to do it in New Zealand or Australia.
636
You're a big liar.
637
Look, I know what I said and when I said it, but when I told her I did not know I would come here.
638
And if I knew I'd come to America and be able to play Ship's Mast on a Challenger dick at the "Zero Point", I would definitely have added a "anyway." I got it?
639
Okay, you will look strange, but I really understand.
640
Anyway, just because you're convinced of these stupid bitches, does not mean I've drunk my brain.
641
- They need two people for that fucking game and I refuse. - Ah.
642
It will be your friend of heart.
643
I do not need you if you're on the other side of the planet.
644
- Do I scratch your back? - You would still cut me off.
645
Yeah, but I got another thing in mind.
646
From now on, as long as you are here, your slave-back-slave will be yours.
647
You will do it whenever you want, you do not even have to ask me.
648
You'll get me the order, you say, "Nice to do."
649
You kick my back, you massage my feet and after the shower put me the moisturizer on the buttocks. I'm in.
650
Let's see if the monster lets us try the car without him.
651
If you leave her, you wait here, we'll be back soon.
652
Thing?
653
- I said: If the monster lets us try. - I heard what you said. Only I can not believe what you said.
654
- You both have a face. - Why?
655
Do not be fooled with me. I was awake all night, I'm still a bit drunk and I have a headache.
656
I should be in the hotel to sleep, not crawling on the Tobacco Way, but as Zoe wants to drive a dick car from "Punto Zero", I'm here.
657
And you have an ass to ask me, no, delete the last one, tell me that I have to make a conversation with Tom Joad while the jokes go to play? I cry, I do not listen to you.
658
- It's not so. - So how is it, Kim? - We must leave you as a guarantee.
659
The monster will never accept it if we leave it all away.
660
I believe that only one pledge pledges as a guarantee.
661
- You do not like what we want to do. - Drive a car?
662
- This is something more. - CioÃ¨? Are you going fast?
663
- Something more. - If you did not understand, we're doing a great favor, because we're doing a shit. But we're stunted, we do not have good sense.
664
But you have good sense and anyone who has good sense will not do what we will do.
665
- Who tells you I do not want to do that? - Abbie, you're a mom. - SÃƒÂ¬.
666
We should be a mythical posse, but this is the excuse you use whenever you want to exclude me from something.
667
What are you dreadful about doing and that I'm so little I'm not even able to understand?
668
Look, since we try to rub the monster, it would be better not to go into the details while watching us.
669
And then, darling, surely they will not let us.
670
Okay, feel if you like it.
671
I will convince him. But if I can, I come with you.
672
- And how do you think they do? - This is my problem.
673
But be sure the monster will say yes.
674
How are you going to do it, a superpump?
675
No!
676
I'll tell Lee Lee will do a blowjob.
677
- How does he do it? - It's not great, but let me do it. So, did you buy it?
678
Okay, mama, listen.
679
Do you want to skip it with the straights? Then you have to act like a pussy.
680
If you come with us, you will not say "fuck" and "shit".
681
- You sit back and I do not want to hear a breath, you know? - Clear.
682
If you complain, we stop in the middle of the street, kick your ass and take you back. - Agree.
683
Okay, do your magic.
684
- Hello Sir. - Hello. - What's your name? - Jasper.
685
- Hi, Jasper, I'm Abernathy. - Aber what? - Abernathy.
686
- And how do you name it? - This is my name.
687
- What the fuck is your name? - Call me Abbie too. - Okay, Abbie.
688
Jasper, me and my friends would like to know if we can take the car for a test ride to see if we really like it.
689
- Why should I do this shit? - To sell his car better.
690
How do I know that you do not fuck her?
691
For four reasons, Jasper. One: We're not thieves, two: Doing so would be rude, three: We're staying at the Days Inn in the city.
692
Call the hotel, ask for directions. We booked throughout the month.
693
In fact, Zoe no, but Kim and I do, so we can absolutely be traced.
694
- Who is Kim, the Negro? - Yeah, Kim would be the color girl.
695
Reason number four, which is the most important: As we take the car for a ride, she will have the great opportunity to do a thorough acquaintance with our friend Lee.
696
I seem to have seen it.
697
- She thinks she has seen her because she's a famous actress. - Ah!
698
- Why is it so tanned? - We're shooting in a Hollywood movie, and it's a cheerleader movie and she's one of the cheerleaders.
699
- A cheerleader movie? - A movie about cheerleaders.
700
- But what is a porn? - Yeah, right.
701
- But do not talk to her, she's very timid. - Timid?
702
Lee, he's Jasper. Jasper, Lee.
703
I recommend, kids, do not bother.
704
See you, splendor. We come to take you later.
705
Hi, Treasures. Do good.
706
Gulp.
707
Do you think what I think?
708
- Yeah, I think so. - What are you thinking about?
709
I'm thinking we told you to close that cock of mouth.
710
- Where are you going now? - Do not move. - I run to piss.
711
So, do you feel ready?
712
- Safety? - I always do not want to do it before I do.
713
- I do not know if you understand. - Of course I understand, because I do not want to do it.
714
- Kim! - I'm just talking.
715
- If you take away all the fun ... - I'm just talking.
716
Do you want to start from above?
717
But surely I start from above, I can not enjoy myself.
718
Take.
719
- No, no, I put it, the jacket. - But the jacket is mine. Look!
720
No. The chances are you made me my slave.
721
- Give it to me. - I'm going out on that cock fuck. Roof a dick! You're on the bonnet.
722
Girls, a car is coming. - Give me the belt. - Oh!
723
- But this is my favorite. - Fuck!
724
- Fuck you, take that of Abernathy. - But ... Okay, we'll use his.
725
- Belt, force. - No. ÃƒÃ † Prada. - Do not do the bitch, come on. - Magic words.
726
- Please, out of my belt. - Just because you were pretty.
727
- It's cute to be nice, Kim. - Brava.
728
Do you know what? Do not even ask me the next time you get your hair.
729
So do me the same.
730
Why do you ask me when nobody sees you.
731
You're not that bad. I do not give you some shit.
732
Abernathy, now do not break the balls. I have other things for the mind.
733
- How scary! - Look, I'm not six.
734
- Do you mind, raise the windows? - No.
735
Now, Abernathy, look what I do.
736
It's out of the window! What the fuck do you do ?!
737
Wow!
738
Push that fucking pedal! Get gas! What if that's enough for that dry ass!
739
Abernathy, move your front legs.
740
All right.
741
Oooh ...
742
Let's see now, bitch, we run even more.
743
- OMG! - What the hell is that?
744
Fuck!
745
Now!
746
- Did you tell him something? - Nothing, I swear.
747
- Shit!
748
- Forgive me for everything! - Forgive me, now thrust, fuck!
749
Go away!
750
Shit! I do not see a fuck, I do not see a fuck!
751
- Do a little bit, do you excite yourself? - You're a fucking whore!
752
Wrap it up, fuck it!
753
Get ready to fly, bitch!
754
- No! - Zoe, do not give up!
755
It's glued to us, you got it behind us.
756
Hey!
757
Hey, lord, this is a shame!
758
Well, adiÃƒÂ²s!
759
Oh, fuck!
760
Bitch!
761
Run, bastard, run! Get out, big bitch!
762
What the hell did I think? She is Zoe, the cat woman!
763
We got close, eh?
764
Dov'ÃƒÂ¨? Where the maniac is over?
765
I fired him and the bastard if he spun it.
766
- Do we want to go get it? - Of course he does.
767
Look ... You're coming down, huh?
768
Do not say shit.
769
Let's dry it.
770
- Okay, put your ass back then. - All right.
771
Bastard son of a bitch!
772
- One moment. - But where the hell are you going? - I'll do it immediately.
773
Let's see ... This! Now we can go, okay?
774
Yeah, fuck, if it's okay. Come here, load that stuff.
775
Just do it! Just do it! Just do it!
776
And now what are you doing, do not you laugh? Do not you have fun, old dick?
777
Where do you go, old shit? Where do you go?
778
You wanted to sow, shit shit, but here we are, behind your ass!
779
Next! Here we are! Cha Cha arrives!
780
- You were just a shit shit! - Yeah, sorry. - That? - I did not want to do anything, I just wanted to play.
781
Ah! He just wanted to play! Well, I do not play with you.
782
Do not run away, do not run away, bastard!
783
It's not a blind road. It's not a blind road.
784
Help!
785
Help!
786
- Asshole!
787
