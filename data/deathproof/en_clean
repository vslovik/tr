1
Hold on. I gotta come up.
2
I gotta take the world's biggest fucking piss.
3
We can't be late. We won't!
4
- Who's holding? - lf you're not then nobody.
5
We were kind of hoping you were. - Yeah. How are you not holding? - Jesus Christ Shanna. It is not my fucking job to supply y'all with weed when we go out.
6
Whoa whoa whoa whoa little lady.
7
You're getting angry kind of quick don't you think?
8
- l was just teasing you. - l'm not angry. It just would be nice if y'all didn't just count on me all the fucking time and surprise me every once in a while with pot.
9
Okay mean girl in a high school movie. Are you through having a tantrum? - l'm not having a tantrum. - Yes you are.
10
You've been in the car all of two seconds and you're already cursing at me.
11
- l am not cursing at you. - You said "Jesus Christ Shanna."
12
And then before the sentence was over you threw a "fucking" in there to emphasize your "irritatance." All right. Come on guys. Don't fight. I'll pay for it when we get some.
13
One: It is not about the money. It is about the pain in the ass of scoring. And two: We're not really fighting.
14
Arlene have you forgotten what hanging out with Jungle Julia's like?
15
That wasn't a fight.
16
That was Julia acting like a grumpy bitch and me calling her on it and indulging her at the same time.
17
That's how we tolerate each other after all these years.
18
Oh billboard.
19
So what's the plan man? Margaritas and Mexican food at Guero's.
20
Did you call Rafael and tell him we're coming? - Of course.
21
- You're so good. I know.
22
Okay is Christian Simonson gonna be there?
23
You bet your ass he is. He's gonna be there with Jesse Letterman.
24
Christian Simonson the filmmaker is in town.
25
He's got a big thing for Julia. If he had a big thing for me he'd fucking call me as opposed to disappearing for six months and he'd get his ass down here more often than he does and on my birthday give me a fucking phone call.
26
Oh billboard.
27
Yeah but you get those legs of yours around him and it's all over.
28
Yeah well when l'm redecorating his house in the hills that l am also living in I'll let you know it worked.
29
So margaritas and Mexican food at Guero's touch base with Chris and Jesse tell them about later and make damn sure they come.
30
Those other guys will be waiting for us to join them at the Texas Chili Parlor.
31
Oh shit. Speaking of which what happened with you and Nate last night?
32
Well you know not mu-- We just fucking met each other.
33
I mean if you don't bust their balls a little bit they're never gonna respect you.
34
Okay we're pretty clear on what it is you didn't do.
35
How about enlightening us on what it is you did do?
36
Nothing to write home about.
37
We just made out on the couch for about 20 minutes.
38
Dressed half-dressed or naked?
39
Dressed. I said we made out. We didn't do the thing.
40
Excuse me for living but what is "the thing"?
41
You know it's everything but. They call it "the thing"?
42
I call it "the thing." Do guys like the thing?
43
They like it better than no thing.
44
Okay l wanna get back to what it is you did do.
45
So you're making out on the couch with Nate right? - Correct. - Whose couch? - His or the one in your hotel room? - What am I stupid over here? Mine.
46
Were you making out sitting up or lying down?
47
We started sitting up. We worked our way to lying down.
48
Mmm the plot thickens. Who was on top? I was straddling him.
49
- What else? - That was it. So we made out for a little while on the couch and I said "Okay l'm gonna go to bed now so it's time for you to leave."
50
And then he starts to whine "Oh right now?"
51
And l said "Yep right now. Let's go." And he says "Well wait. What about this?"
52
And I said "No." He said "What do you mean no? You don't even know what l'm gonna say."
53
I said "l already know what you're gonna say and the answer's no."
54
He said "How can you say you know what I'm gonna say?"
55
I said "Because you're gonna say 'let's just go to sleep together. "'We don't gotta do nothing. "'Just cuddle sleep next to each other wake up in the morning together.' No you're gonna leave but I'll see you tomorrow."
56
Yeah fuck Nate. I mean he's cute and all
57
but Jesse Letterman's gonna be all over her.
58
- Jesse Letterman-- - Remember no hooking up tonight.
59
You can hang out with him you can make out with him but no hooking up with him because we are driving to Lake LBJ tonight and my daddy's pretty clear about one thing.
60
He said "l am letting you and your girlfriends stay at my lake house not you and a bunch of horny boys trying to get their fuck on with my daughter."
61
- Your dad talks like that? - Hell yeah!
62
It's not like he ain't gonna know either because when I'm staying at the lake house with my girlfriends in our bikinis Daddy just has a tendency to pop up and make sure we don't need anything.
63
Look he's totally harmless and cute as a bug's ear.
64
But you know when he's got a bunch of half-naked poontang walking the floor of his lake house he just likes to pay us a visit and make sure we got everything we need.
65
And if you flirt shamelessly with him like the six-foot baby giraffe in the backseat you got a puppy dog for life.
66
I have my own relationship with Ben and you're just jealous 'cause it don't include you.
67
- You call her dad Ben? - l'm not a child. That's his name.
68
So when are the boys showing up? They're gonna meet us at the Chili Parlor.
69
Maybe they can bring some pot. Fuck that. No.
70
I don't wanna be either A depending on their fucking ass or B depending on their ass. Uh-uh. We don't score ourselves we're gonna be stuck with them all fucking night.
71
Ooh try Lanna Frank. Best idea you had all day.
72
Oh hey that's your last billboard before Guero's.
73
Oh come on. Give me a break.
74
"Oh come on" my ass! We said every time. Okay.
75
Jules let me get a drag? Thanks.
76
- Hey. - Hey.
77
- You wanna join us? - For a second but l'm with some friends.
78
Oh. So you must be-- must be-- So you must be the infamous Butterfly.
79
Shh! She don't know nothing about it.
80
- Know about what? - When were y'all gonna tell her?
81
- Soon. - Tell me what? Yeah now thanks to you we gotta tell her sooner than later.
82
All right cut the shit. What the fuck is going on?
83
I said a little somethin'-somethin' about you on the air today.
84
Julia what the fuck did you say about me on the radio?
85
All I said was I had a sexy friend named Butterfly who was in from out of town for the weekend and we would be going out somewhere in Austin tonight and if they were out on the town maybe they'd see us. And l described you and I said that if they spotted you while we were out if they'd do something you'd do something.
86
Okay now Julia I'm serious. What did you say and what did you say l'd do?
87
Anyhoo l could explain what l said which would be boring or Marcy over here who is an incredible actress could act it out for you which I think will give you a better idea of what you have in store for you tonight.
88
Okay so just tell me your way. - So we'll act it out with Marcy? - Sure.
89
Okay give Marcy your drink. Thank you.
90
Okay so you're in a club or a bar and Marcy's a kind of cute or kind of hot or kind of sexy or better be fucking hysterically funny but not funny-looking guy who you could fuck.
91
- Got it. - Okay Marcy take it.
92
Howdy.
93
Hi there.
94
Excuse me but your name wouldn't be Butterfly would it?
95
Yes it is. lt seems you have me at a disadvantage.
96
Barry. Pleased to meet you Barry. - Y'all are getting me hot. - Shh!
97
So is uh Butterfly your real name?
98
Yes it is. And how'd you know my name Barry?
99
I listened to Jungle Julia's show this morning.
100
Oh you did did you? Oh yeah. l listen to her show every morning.
101
Oh you do do you? Yeah. She's like the coolest lady in town.
102
Don't you think she's got a big ass? Nah man.
103
I like her ass that way.
104
She got a black girl's ass.
105
Well that's what she always says but natural fact she doesn't really have a black girl's ass. - She's got a big ass. - Okay what the fuck are you doing?
106
Oh look who wants to get to the point all of a sudden. Okay we'll get to the point.
107
But for your information skinny bitch black men and a whole lot of motherfucking white men have had plenty fun adoring my ass.
108
I don't wear their teeth marks on my butt for nothing.
109
All right if you're not gonna buy me a drink can I have mine back? No. Okay okay okay okay.
110
So Butterfly can I buy you a drink? - l'd love one. - What can l get you? I'll take a margarita.
111
Here you go.
112
So after they buy you a drink when they raise their glass to toast they look you dead in the eye and repeat this poem: "The woods are lovely dark and deep "and l have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep.
113
"Did you hear me Butterfly?
114
Miles to go before you sleep."
115
And then if they say that... you gotta give them a lap dance. What?
116
If they call you Butterfly buy you a drink repeat that poem you gotta give them a lap dance. That's bullshit. I ain't giving them nothing. Well you can do it or not but if you don't everybody in Austin's gonna think you're a chickenshit. And l don't think you want everybody in Austin thinking you're a chickenshit.
117
I ain't giving nobody no lap dance 'cause of what you said.
118
Oh come on. It's gonna be funny. Yeah everything's funny to you two when it's happening to me.
119
Look you don't have to do it for anybody you don't want.
120
l said you'd do it for the first guy who says it. So some geek comes over trying to be cool just tell him you already did it at another place earlier.
121
No harm no foul but you get a free drink out of it. But maybe a little later in the evening you've had a few drinks you're kind of loosey-goosey you're safe with your girls then some kind of cute kind of hot kind of sexy hysterically funny but not funny-looking guy comes up and says it then maybe you did it earlier maybe you didn't.
122
Where the hell is Lanna Frank? That's a good fucking question.
123
Lanna Frank! Where are you?
124
Well come over already. We're waiting for you.
125
Shit! Hold on!
126
So where are you?
127
Come over already. We're waiting for you.
128
No we're not coming over there. You come over here like you said you would.
129
So is it "Shawna" and the girls at the lake house this weekend?
130
- "Shawna"? - Oh fuck! I--
131
No. Now there is one thing that every girl in the whole world whose name is Shanna has in common with each other we all hate the name Shawna and we really hate it when people call us Shawna.
132
Just remember it's Shanna Banana not Shawna Banawna.
133
Okay but at some point in the evening l had fuckability stock.
134
Yeah. l mean... it wasn't bullish but...
135
Okay Warren's sending over shots. And you know the house rule:
136
If he sends over shots you've gotta do them. - What? - Hey them's the rules baby. Warren says it we do it!
137
l love that philosophy: "Warren says it we do it."
138
- So let's do it! - What is it?
139
Hey shot first questions later. Here we go! Post time!
140
Mmm!
141
Whoo-hoo!
142
Now is that a tasty beverage or is that a tasty beverage?
143
What the fuck is it?
144
Chartreuse the only liquor so good they named a color after it.
145
Who's down for dos Chartreuse?
146
Not me. - l'm going out for a smoke.
147
But careful where you keep that hot flame all right?
148
Drinks. What can I get you? Shanna Banana?
149
Another big-ass Long Island iced tea.
150
Bombay Sapphire and tonic no ice. Good boy.
151
Oh hey Punky uh one of the lights is off in the parking lot. Flip it.
152
- Oh Jesus Christ! - Whoa!
153
You scared the fuck out of me you shitty asshole!
154
l swear Arlene I was not trying to scare you.
155
I just got lucky. Oh hardy-fucking-har. Go inside. - Wait a minute. - Why? - l was thinking we could make out. - What on a porch? Not even in the bar but in front of the entrance?
156
- Forget it. - No in my car.
157
What out there? It's wet as fucking 'Nam out there. Not in my car it's not.
158
Look you won't get wet. I promise you.
159
You know most guys wouldn't brag about that.
160
Ha-ha-ha. You know what l mean.
161
Look l know you guys are going to Lake LBJ and we can't come. I wanna make out! Okay just stop with the whining. lt's not attractive.
162
Okay but I don't want it super-fucking obvious
163
to everybody in the bar l've been gone so we'll go in your car we'll make out for six minutes and that's it.
164
- Deal? - Great.
165
No no no. Deal or no deal? If you're gonna whine when l pull the plug in six minutes we can just walk back inside the fucking bar right now.
166
- Deal. No whining. - And no begging. And no begging. When you say done it's done.
167
I'm gonna remember you said that. Okay let's go.
168
Oh you got two jobs: kiss good and make sure my hair don't get wet.
169
Now look you can't look like you're trying to get her out of here before Christian Simonson shows up
170
but you've got to get her out of here before Christian Simonson shows up.
171
But what's the point? They're going to Shanna's daddy's house at Lake LBJ and it's no guys-- absolutely no guys.
172
Okay so after we bring the girls drinks in fairly rapid order but not obvious we order two more rounds of shots. You think they're gonna fall for that?
173
We'll be very convincing. Now it's time to turn up the volume. No more fucking around. We go to Jäger shots.
174
Man they're not gonna drink Jäger shots.
175
Dude as long as a guy's buying the booze a fucking bitch'll drink anything.
176
Come on dude we can at least get one shot of Jäger down these fucking bitches' throats.
177
After that we'll see if they got another Jäger shot in them.
178
You never know. That could be the shot that puts them past the point of "fuck it."
179
Then all of a sudden "no guys at the lake house" turns into "a couple of guys at the lake house." My point exactly.
180
l know l can at least get Shanna "Suck My" Banana to do a fucking Buttery Nipple shot.
181
What's Julia's sweet shot? - Key lime pie. - Oh come on. Even fucking Leroy Brown'd do one more for dessert.
182
Dude check it out. I wonder if B.J. brought the Bear with him.
183
Jesus!
184
Dude fucking cut himself falling out of his time machine.
185
Could l get a chicken suit for Stroker Ace please?
186
And where did you two disappear to? I had to get something out of the car and Nate was gentlemanly enough to escort me with his umbrella.
187
Ah good for you Nate. You see that pretty girl sitting by herself at the bar?
188
Who the dirty hippie? Meow. She's not a hippie.
189
She might as well be a hippie.
190
Thank you Timmy boy. Well do you know what just happened to her?
191
No. But I know she's a skinny fake-blonde bitch.
192
Oh l'm sorry. You were telling a story. What about her?
193
Hey Warren is there anybody in this place you could vouch for to give me a ride home?
194
Fair lady your chariot awaits. You've been eavesdropping?
195
Oh eavesdropping and can't help but hear. I think I belong in the latter category.
196
So uh Icy Hot are you offering me a ride home?
197
l'm offering you a lift if when l'm ready to leave you are too.
198
And when are you thinking about leaving?
199
Truthfully I'm not thinking about it. But when l do you will be the first to know.
200
Will you be able to uh drive later?
201
I know looks can be deceiving but I'm a teetotaler.
202
I've been drinking club soda and lime all night and now l'm building up to my big drink.
203
Which is what? Virgin piña colada.
204
Okay. Why would someone who doesn't drink spend hours at a bar drinking water?
205
A bar offers all kind of things other than alcohol.
206
Mmm. Really? Like what?
207
Women nacho grande platters the fellowship of some fascinating individuals like Warren here.
208
Alcohol is just a lubricant for all the individual encounters that a barroom offers.
209
Ooh. Is that cowboy wisdom? I'm not a cowboy Pam.
210
I'm a stuntman. But that's a very easy mistake to make.
211
How do you know my name?
212
When you were talking with Warren couldn't help but overhear.
213
Fair enough. So what's your name Icy?
214
Stuntman Mike. Stuntman Mike's your name?
215
You ask anybody.
216
Hey Warren who is this guy? Stuntman Mike.
217
- And who the hell is Stuntman Mike? - He's a stuntman.
218
You know Pam I think it's time for my big drink.
219
Well Stuntman Mike since I have a tab here can l buy you that virgin piña colada?
220
Thank you Pam. That would be lovely.
221
Warren a uh virgin piña colada for my stuntman friend
222
and I'll have another Cadillac Cabo Wabo margarita.
223
Cabo Wabo virgin.
224
That table. Seems to keep um getting your attention. Is that the girl from the billboard outside? - Yep. - She sure is a striking-looking woman.
225
It's got gin tequila--
226
- Look at that hair. - Lots of leave-in conditioner.
227
- ls that jealousy l detect? - Hardly.
228
But if you wanna get with uh Jungle Julia there's a real easy way to do that. - Really? - Yeah.
229
- What would that be? - Get famous.
230
You won't have to find her. She'll find you.
231
And you don't even wanna know what she did for that billboard.
232
Enjoy it cocksucker. You've earned it.
233
What did she ever do to you?
234
We went to school together from kindergarten through high school.
235
That's what she did to me.
236
She was her height right now at 12. She was a monster.
237
Half the guys she still fucks from the old class she used to beat up and terrorize in the fifth grade.
238
l see. And she used to beat you up and take your chocolate milk huh?
239
That pituitary case? Might've kicked my ass a couple of times.
240
Sorry. l'm built like a girl not a black man. But I'd die before I ever gave Julia Lucai my chocolate milk.
241
Hey are you famous or something?
242
Or something. No no no. Really.
243
Hey what do you do? Really?
244
What I do is work my ass off to get my own record label off the ground.
245
But why that girl wanted a picture of me is because l'm a local deejay.
246
Wait a minute.
247
You got a billboard by Big Kahuna Burger don't you? Yeah. I got one there too Zatoichi. Yeah.
248
Jungle Julia Lucai. Stuntman Mike McKay.
249
Well good to meet you Stuntman Mike.
250
Now my friends and I are gonna continue to get our weed on.
251
- Would you care for some? - Thank you Julia. But just the same no thanks.
252
- Suit yourself. - But you know--
253
Aw shit. Oh God.
254
Sorry. lt's nothing.
255
What the fuck was that?
256
Actually l do want you to have a shot.
257
You got some voucher here.
258
I asked him what movies you worked on. No fucking clue.
259
Well technically l really don't know if he's ever done anything for sure.
260
I mean he shows me an episode of High Chaparall a guy falls off a horse he says it's him.
261
You know the show The Virginian?
262
Yeah well there was another actor on that show-- Gary Clarke-- and I looked like him a bit.
263
Obviously before I cut myself shaving.
264
Oh I like it.
265
Well damn if you ain't so sweet you make sugar taste just like salt.
266
Anyway I did a lot of Virginians doubling Gary Clarke.
267
And uh then that show turned into The Men of Shiloh they brought on Lee Majors and l doubled him.
268
From that point on I specialized mostly in car stunts.
269
Yeah I did damn near the whole third season of Vegas.
270
I was Robert Urich's driving double.
271
And then Bob did another show-- Gavilan and he brought me with him on that till...
272
And after that...
273
Do you know any of these shows or people I'm talking about?
274
Sorry. - No. - No.
275
So how exactly does one become a stuntman Stuntman Mike?
276
Well in Hollywood anybody fool enough to throw himself down a flight of stairs can usually find somebody to pay him for it.
277
But really l got into the business the way most people get in the stunt business. - How's that? - My brother got me in it. - Well who's your brother? - Stuntman Bob.
278
- I'm ready to blaze. - Finally. Yeah.
279
- You need to catch up with us. - Now the party can start.
280
Yep. Anyhoo l'm sorry. Will you forgive me?
281
But you have to be real nice to me for the whole rest of the time l'm here.
282
- Promise. You ready to go to the lake? - Mm-hmm.
283
How about your little friend? You wanna bring him? I thought no boys. If you really want him to come Shanna won't mind.
284
So how about it? Boys or just us girls? Us girls. Good idea.
285
Ladies.
286
Thanks. Cheers Butterfly.
287
"The woods are lovely dark and deep "and I have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep.
288
"Did you hear me Butterfly?
289
Miles to go before you sleep."
290
Sorry Stuntman Burt-- Mike.
291
Mike. She already broke off that dance. Is that true?
292
Did l miss my chance?
293
Do I frighten you?
294
Is it my scar?
295
It's your car. Ah. Yeah I know.
296
Sorry. It's my mom's car.
297
Have you been following us? No. But that's what I love about Austin. It's just so damn small.
298
- You've seen this guy before? - l saw him outside of Guero's.
299
And l saw you outside Guero's too.
300
You saw my car l saw your legs.
301
Now look I ain't stalking y'all but I didn't say I wasn't a wolf.
302
So you really weren't following us? I'm not following you Butterfly.
303
I just got lucky.
304
So how about that lap dance?
305
Sorry. lt was a one-time-only offer and she did it earlier this evening at Anton's.
306
- No she didn't. - How do you know?
307
I'm good that way. And you look a little touchéd.
308
- What's "touchéd"? - Wounded slightly.
309
Why should I be wounded? Because you expected guys to be pestering you all night but from your look I can tell nobody pestered you at all. That kind of hurt your feelings a little bit didn't it? There are few things as fetching as a bruised ego on a beautiful angel.
310
So... how about that lap dance?
311
I think I'm gonna have to give you a rain check.
312
Well since you'll be leaving in the next couple of days that rain check will be worthless.
313
But that's okay.
314
I understand if I make you uncomfortable.
315
You're still a nice girl and I still like you.
316
But I must warn you of something.
317
You know how people say...
318
"You're okay in my book" or "ln my book that's no good"?
319
Well l actually have a book. And everybody I ever meet goes in this book.
320
And now l've met you and you're going in the book.
321
Except l'm afraid I must file you... under "chickenshit."
322
And what if l did it?
323
Well I definitely couldn't file you under "chickenshit" then now could I?
324
What's your name again? Stuntman Mike.
325
Well Stuntman Mike l'm Butterfly. My friend Jungle Julia over here says that jukebox inside is pretty impressive.
326
- Yeah it is. - Yeah.
327
Why don't you go get ready for your lap dance?
328
What about "kind of cute kind of hot kind of sexy hysterically funny but not funny-looking guy who you could fuck" did you not understand?
329
I think you got Mike laid tonight.
330
- He's old enough to be my dad-- - I can still hear you.
331
- Bye. - Bye-bye.
332
Wow that's fucking scary. Yeah well I wanted it to be impressive.
333
Scary tends to impress.
334
Is it safe? Oh it's better than safe. It's death proof.
335
How do you make a car death proof? Well that's what stuntmen do. You've seen a movie where a car gets into some smash-up there ain't no way in hell anybody's walking away from?
336
Yeah. Well how do you think they accomplish that?
337
CGI?
338
Well unfortunately Pam nowadays more often than not you're right.
339
But back in the all-or-nothing days the Vanishing Point days the Dirty Mary Crazy Larry days the White Line Fever days-- real cars smashing into real cars with real dumb people driving them.
340
So you give the stunt team the car you want to smash up take her and reinforce that fucker everywhere and voilà you got yourself a death-proof automobile.
341
That makes sense. I just didn't know you could make a car death proof.
342
Hell I can drive this baby into a brick wall doing 125 miles an hour just for the experience.
343
Why is your passenger seat in a box? Well this is a movie car.
344
Sometimes when you're shooting a crash director wants to put a camera in the car. You know shoot the crash from the inside.
345
That's where you put the camera. They call it a crash box. Here.
346
There you go.
347
You know when you asked to drive me home you didn't mention your car didn't have a passenger seat.
348
Yeah well actually I didn't ask to drive you home. You asked me for a ride and l said yes. But look at the bright side Pam. I won't be getting fresh putting my hand on your knee. That is the bright side.
349
I thought so.
350
Well Pam which way you going? - Left or right? - Right. Ah that's too bad. Why?
351
Well because there was a 50-50 shot on whether you'd be going left or right.
352
You see we're both going left. You could've just as easily been going left too and if that was the case it would've been a while before you started getting scared.
353
But since you're going the other way I'm afraid... you're gonna have to start getting scared...immediately.
354
What the fuck?
355
Cocksucking motherfucker! Just fucking let me out of here!
356
I'll fucking rip your fucking-- Stop the fucking car!
357
Okay here's the thing. I get it.
358
I-- l know it's a joke and it's super-funny.
359
Um but if you just stop right now you know and-- and-- and let me out I'll never tell anybody because l know it's a joke.
360
I know all about jokes. I promise everything will be fine.
361
Just-- Just-- Just let me out please and-- and-- Hey Pam
362
remember when I said this car was death proof?
363
Well that wasn't a lie.
364
This car is 100% death proof.
365
Only to get the benefit of it honey you really need to be sitting in my seat.
366
Now I gotta catch me my other girlfriends.
367
No no no no.lt's Dave Dee Dozy Beaky Mitch and Tich.
368
So you got it? Thanks honey. You're gonna play it next song right?
369
Good boy.
370
Growl.
371
Bye-bye.
372
Who do you wanna hear? Dave Dee Dozy Beaky Mitch and Tich.
373
Who? Dave Dee Dozy Beaky Mitch and Tich.
374
Who the fuck are they? For your information Pete Townshend at one point almost quit The Who and if he had he would've ended up in this group thus making it Dave Dee Dozy Beaky Mitch Tich and Pete. And if you ask me he should have. That's my boy! I wanna hear this part of the song louder!
375
Do you remember anything?
376
Uh l don't remember.
377
Dr. Block.
378
Well what's the patient's prognosis Dr. Block?
379
I don't really see it's any of your business. Come on now sis. You just tell us.
380
How bad is he?
381
He got banged up real good. Busted nose broken collarbone smashed up his left index finger. Is that it?
382
He was real lucky.
383
That'll be all? Why that's more than enough and I wanna thank you Dr. Block.
384
Son of a bitch!
385
So Pop what do you think? Well son number one what I think is so goddamn ghoulish I hesitate to speak it out loud.
386
Well give it a shot. Well what we have here is a case of vehicular homicide.
387
That old boy in there murdered them pretty little gals.
388
I mean he used a car and not a hatchet but they dead just the same.
389
Well what are you gonna do? Not a goddamn thing.
390
The DA says ain't no crime here.
391
Every one of them gals was swimming in alcohol and floating on weed. And old Hooper in there came out clean as a whistle.
392
Now you actually think that he premeditatedly murdered them gals?
393
Well I can't prove it but since thinking don't cost nothing I can think it and I do.
394
Yeah but Pop he got pretty banged up hisself.
395
Well hell yeah he got banged up but God damn! Them pretty little gals look like a goddamn giant chewed 'em up and spit 'em out.
396
Any of 'em survive? Shit.
397
Two tons of metal flesh and bone and plain old Newton... They all princess died.
398
Why?
399
Well l'd guestimate it's a sex thing.
400
The only way l can figure it.
401
High-velocity impact twisted metal busted glass all four souls taken exactly at the same time.
402
Probably the only way that diabolical degenerate can shoot his goo.
403
Yeah l think the only thing we can dream of getting that bastard on is vehicular manslaughter for the hitchhiker in the death box. That was just plain old goddamn reckless endangerment.
404
But I got me a goddamn bartender gonna testify that old Stuntman Mike didn't drink a drop all night and his passenger was left stranded by her date in the goddamn rain no less and she asked him for the fucking ride.
405
Now on paper it's gonna look like he's just trying to help her out.
406
I mean that's the way the jury's gonna see it. So what are you gonna do Pop?
407
Well l can take it upon myself to work the case you know in my off hours.
408
Search for evidence you know to prove my theory. Alert authorities. Dog that rotten son of a bitch.
409
Wherever he goes I go. Or I can spend the same goddamn amount of time and energy following the NASCAR circuit. Hmm. I thought about it a lot.
410
I think l'd have a hell of lot happier life if I did the latter.
411
And just because I can't punish old... Frankenstein in there for what he's done I'm gonna tell you like the Lord told John. If he ever does it again I can make goddamn sure he don't do it in Texas.
412
- So are you on the same floor with him? - No he's on the 4th and l'm on the 7th.
413
- Who's in whose room? - He's in mine.
414
- And so what happened then? - That was pretty much it. We made out in the hall for about 10 minutes and then I sent him off to his room. - So how's The Rock as a kisser? - Mmm he's damn good! He's got them mushy lips and fingertips.
415
Mmm l love them mushy lips. And he's a big guy so he spins me around so my back's up against him. Then he takes his big hand and he puts it on my throat tilts my head back and leans over me kisses me from behind.
416
- Damn that sounds sexy! - Mmm it was sexy.
417
But then that was it? You sent him off?
418
How'd he take it? Wait a minute. What are we doing here?
419
lf I'm gonna power through and pick up Zoë at the airport I need a big-ass cup of coffee. Since you're getting that can you get some more vodka and some more sugar-free Red Bull?
420
We didn't know you were awake. I'm not awake. l'm asleep.
421
But get some more vodka and some more sugar-free Red Bull anyway. And some Red Apple Tans.
422
Damn! I didn't stop to get you bitches groceries!
423
- You remember how to get to the airport don't you? - Uh-huh.
424
Well then you should get behind the wheel 'cause you gonna drive.
425
Motherfuckers!
426
They ain't got sugar-free Red Bull. They got regular Red Bull and sugar-free G.O. juice.
427
- G.O. - G.O.!
428
Where the hell are my keys? Oh here they are.
429
Oh sorry. l didn't mean to give you a concert there.
430
No it wasn't you. That guy bumped into my feet when he walked by.
431
I don't know why but that kind of creeped me out.
432
Little dick.
433
Clearly.
434
Since I'm up I might as well hit the ATM. Get me a fucking smoke.
435
What? Did you just see the-- What? Nothing honey.
436
Yello. It's me. Miss me?
437
Oh you best get your ass off Kim's car.
438
I've seen Kim sit on it before. Her ass ain't your ass.
439
Okay.
440
So I think I'm in this month's issue of Allure.
441
You got Allure? Magazines by the window.
442
Here you are!
443
You hot mama you.
444
See you in a second.
445
And you get 15 and change back. Thank you very much.
446
You know l got other fashion magazines for sale behind the counter.
447
No that's okay. This'll be all.
448
- Thought I'd ask. - Thanks anyway. Have a good one.
449
I got this month's issue of Italian Vogue.
450
This month's?
451
Listen to this.
452
The Circle A clerk has this month's issue of Italian Vogue.
453
- No way. - Way.
454
l can't believe a fucking Circle A carries Italian Vogue.
455
It doesn't. It's his own personal copy.
456
He'll let it go for 27 bucks. Twenty-seven bucks?
457
What the fuck do you care? We're talking about fucking per diem here.
458
Look we found an issue of Italian Vogue in Lebanon Tennessee. We're lucky he's not asking for fucking Krugerrands. I'm getting it and we're splitting it three ways.
459
What me you and Kim? No Kim doesn't give a shit about Italian Vogue.
460
But Brandy will come in with us and if she won't Tysla her sister will.
461
Okay. But if anybody tears out any sheets I want you gotta make color Xerox of those pages. And l'm not talking fucking Kinko's here either okay? You take it to the art department you have them do it fucking right.
462
Well l'm doing Lindsay Lohan's makeup and she's off for the next three days there's no stunts being filmed during that time so Kim's free and Lee's on a "will notify" for the next four days.
463
So how's the shoot going? Great. We're having the best time.
464
The director Cecil Evans is so much fun.
465
We're making the coolest movie and partying all the time.
466
Hell yeah. The next job after this one is definitely gonna suck.
467
So let's hear it ladies. Set romances. Who's getting it off?
468
That would be Lee and Toolbox. Oh Toolbox. Name sounds promising.
469
- He's a grip. - What he is is a pervert.
470
Well he just keeps sounding better and better.
471
What's his perversion?
472
He likes to watch me pee.
473
Lee is sitting on the toilet and Toolbox is watching her pee.
474
P-I-S-S-l-N-G.
475
Yeah but not no more. Now she's getting it on with The Rock.
476
- You're having one off with The Rock? - Not the real Rock. He's this electrician named Bruce.
477
And Kim started calling him The Rock 'cause he kind of looks like The Rock so now we all just call him The Rock. Oh yeah. This is an all-star crew.
478
We got a guy who looks like Nick Cage and a guy who looks like Pee-wee Herman too.
479
Kim dick department. Let's hear it.
480
Mm-mm. No dick this trip. I got a man.
481
- How long have you had this boyfriend? - About three months.
482
Who'd you steal him from? - Nobody. - Kim! Wha-- What? He totally had a girlfriend.
483
All of Kim's boyfriends start out as somebody else's boyfriend.
484
I did not steal him. I didn't steal any of them. They just...jumped ship.
485
So what's your story Abernathy?
486
Oh Abbie's got the big kahuna.
487
I had a set crush on Cecil. Set crush? Nigga please! You were his set wife.
488
"Were" and "had" being the key words here.
489
Bitch you two are still into each other and you know it.
490
Yeah well if he's so in love with me then whey did he fuck Daryl Hannah's stand-in?
491
Ho-ho-ho! Yes men are dogs. Oh it's so funny!
492
Oh it's so funny! Oh stop acting all hurt. Your ass just mad. Yeah he's a stand-in fucker.
493
Bitch you need to get over that shit. That was two weeks ago.
494
Oh well now that you put it like that.
495
Oh l haven't told you the best part. He fucked her on my birthday.
496
Oh that's a horse of a different color. Thank you.
497
Did he know it was your birthday? He's the director. He's kind of busy.
498
He ate a piece of my birthday cake and he got me a present. Yeah l think he knew. Well what did he get you?
499
He made me a tape.
500
He made you a tape? - Yeah. - Wait.
501
He didn't burn you a CD. He made you a tape? - Yeah. - Oh that is so romantic. Yes. I know what you're gonna say so don't even go there. That sounds like the test of true love to me.
502
Look I know you guys like him. He's likable but he fucked another woman on my birthday.
503
How can you not be on my side?
504
Well l admit that sounds bad. It is bad!
505
It just sounds like there's a little more to it than that.
506
- Were you two fucking? - Hell no.
507
Hello. Is your name Abernathy? Sorry.
508
The answer to your question is no of course not.
509
What do you mean "No of course not"?
510
The reason Cecil hasn't had a girlfriend in six years is because girls will fuck him. And if you fuck Cecil you don't become one of his girlfriends.
511
Not to say I want to be his girlfriend but if l did want to be his girlfriend if I fucked him I wouldn't be his girlfriend. I'd be one of his regulars.
512
And l'm just getting too fucking old for that shit.
513
Have you let him do anything? Yes!
514
I've let him give me a foot massage and when we go to the movies I've let him hold my hand.
515
Bitch you might be acting like you 12 years old but he just acting like a man. You need to break that nigga off a piece.
516
Let me get this straight. - You're not fucking him... - Mm-mm. - you're not sucking him... - Mm-mm. you're not giving him any tongue but Daryl Hannah's stand-in is. Okay can we just take my sex life off the table?
517
Actually uh it was Cecil's sex life that was on the table and your lack of one.
518
Ohhh! Fuck both of you and your little high five.
519
Before you can claim a nigga you got to claim a nigga and you can start by giving that motherfucker a hand job in the back of the van on Tuesday.
520
I'm not gonna do that. I know you won't. But you know who will.
521
The bitch that ends up living in that big-ass mansion of his.
522
Now I gotta say I haven't entirely agreed with everything Kim said but it is true: if you stretch shit out like you have with Cecil and you suddenly get dirty on them it blows their mind.
523
So Zoë Kim and I are in the Philippines at an outdoor rave.
524
- What were you working on? - Three Kicks to the Head Part Three.
525
And admittedly we're a little fucked-up.
526
- Cheers to that. - Word.
527
Cheers.
528
So Zoë the genius wants to take a picture of me.
529
It's dark as hell and you can't see shit.
530
So she's got her camera and keeps saying "Step back a little" so I do. Then "A little further" so l step back a little further. Then "A little more" so l do.
531
Then I realize I'm right at the edge of a seven-foot concrete ditch with God knows how many rocks and broken bottles and rats in it and if l fell in that fucking thing I'd probably would've broken my fucking neck.
532
So l'm yelling at her "Zoë you almost killed me!"
533
So we laugh about it and walk a little further and Zoë starts fucking around and damn if she doesn't fall in the fucking ditch.
534
Nice. Nice. Thank you. Yep. Thank you.
535
I remember taking a step and looking down. Just as l'm thinking "There's that ditch Abbie was talking about" bam l'm in the fucking ditch you know? What happened?
536
What with Zoë the cat? Nothing.
537
If I fell in that fucking thing they would've had to helicopter me out of there.
538
Zoë just lands on her feet.
539
But then later I started feeling a little bad about myself.
540
Zoë falls in the ditch and it's nothing.
541
We're laughing about it.
542
If I fell in that fucking thing I probably would've been fucking paralyzed.
543
Oh honey you can't think like that.
544
You know we all have our individual talents and that just happens to be one of Zoë's.
545
- Yeah. - Well... physically speaking Zoë is amazing. I mean agility reflexes nimbleness.
546
There's few human beings that can fuck with Zoë on that front. Oh Kim l like you too.
547
Having said that before you get too envious of Zoë's prowess you're missing the most important part of that story.
548
You didn't fall in the ditch Zoë did.
549
Zoë even knew there was a ditch there because you told her and she still fell in.
550
So Lee's right. We all have our talents. Hey l resemble that remark.
551
So Kim you still pack a roscoe?
552
Check it out bitch. - Ooh nice one mate. - I know this.
553
- What's a roscoe? - A roscoe is a pistol.
554
- You carry a gun? - Uh-huh.
555
- You have a license to carry it? - Yeah.
556
When I became a Secret Service agent they gave me a license.
557
Oh l didn't know you were--
558
Okay l didn't say it all right? Stop looking at me. l didn't say it. God!
559
Did you know Kim carried a gun? Yes. Now do I approve? No.
560
Do I know? Yes.
561
Look I don't know what futuristic utopia you live in but the world I live in a bitch need a gun.
562
You can't get around the fact that people who carry guns tend to get shot more than people who don't.
563
And you can't get around the fact that if l go down to the laundry room in my building at midnight enough times I might get my ass raped.
564
Don't do your laundry at midnight. Fuck that. I wanna do my laundry whenever the fuck I wanna do my laundry.
565
There are other things you can carry other than a gun.
566
Pepper spray. Uh motherfucker try to rape me I don't wanna give him a skin rash.
567
I wanna shut that nigga down.
568
How about a knife at least?
569
Yeah. You know what happens to motherfuckers carry knives?
570
They get shot!
571
Look if l ever become a famous actress I won't carry a gun.
572
I'll hire me a do-dirt nigga and he'll carry the gun.
573
And when shit goes down l'll sit back and laugh. But until that day it's Wild West motherfucker.
574
So Zoë you thought about what you want to do first?
575
It just so happens I know exactly what l wanna do.
576
Oh really? And what would that be?
577
To me there's no point in being in America unless you can drive a Detroit muscle car.
578
And l wanna drive a Dodge Challenger. Fuck me swinging balls out.
579
Um well I guess we can talk to Transpo. But does it have to be a Dodge Challenger? Not just that.
580
It has to be a 1970 Dodge Challenger with a 440 engine.
581
How in the fuck do you expect to do that?
582
No worries mate. I've got it all worked out.
583
When I knew l was coming here l went online and found out that the local paper here in Tennessee is the Lebanon News Sentinel.
584
- So back home-- - l'm sorry. Where's home? Australia right?
585
What do you mean by that mate? Zoë's from New Zealand and you never-- I repeat never-- call a Kiwi an Aussie.
586
That is unless you want your ass kicked.
587
I'm so sorry. I really am.
588
Oh it's okay. We're just taking the piss out of you mate.
589
Auckland to answer your question.
590
Anyway l subscribed to the local paper a month ago.
591
Now why the fuck you want a local redneck newspaper in New Zealand?
592
Pipe down and I'll tell you.
593
I've been getting the paper for the last month and I've been checking the classified at the back looking at cars for sale.
594
So as of yesterday for sale in this town some dude is selling a stock with a 440 engine and a white paint job.
595
And you wanna buy it?
596
Kim l may be stupid but I'm not bloody stupid.
597
I wanna say I wanna buy it so he'll let me test-drive it.
598
A 1970 Dodge Challenger with a white paint job.
599
- Oh uh Kowalski. - Kowalski from Vanishing Point.
600
- Mate it's a fucking classic! - Mmm I get it. If I can get this guy to let me drive it without him I will blow the doors off that bitch.
601
- What's Vanishing Point? - Oh God. "What's Vanishing Point?"
602
Abs I'm supposed to be the illiterate one.
603
lt's just one of the best American movies ever made.
604
Actually Zoë most girls wouldn't know Vanishing Point.
605
Excuse me. "Most girls"? What the fuck are you two?
606
Yeah well we're gearheads. Of course we watched it.
607
Y'all grew up watching that Pretty in Pink shit.
608
Oh I like Pretty in Pink.
609
What so you didn't watch John Hughes movies?
610
Of course l did. I'm a girl.
611
But l also watched car shit too.
612
- Vanishing Point Dirty Mary Crazy Larry... - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Gone in 60 Seconds--
613
The real one not that Angelina Jolie bullshit.
614
We have an outdoors theater in Auckland. It plays Vanishing Point Big Wednesday all the classics.
615
What do you horny gals want? Hey you got a 1970 Dodge Challenger for sale?
616
Right up here ladies.
617
This shit is off the fucking hook!
618
Fucking legendary mate.
619
Sweet ass. Well if you'll excuse me for a moment I'd just like to have a word alone with my business associate.
620
- You ladies take your time.
621
What are you waiting for? Ask him to let you drive it by yourself. - I... I intend to but first I need to ask you something. What?
622
If he lets us take it out on our own I wanna play ship's mast. - Oh hell no! - Would you keep it down?
623
- Ain't no way I'm doing ship's mast. - For Christ sakes--
624
- Don't blaspheme. - Sorry.
625
Now what did you say after the last time?
626
- Look l know what l said-- - What did you say?
627
- I know I said we shouldn't do this again - No. You didn't say we shouldn't.
628
You said we ain't ever gonna do that again. - Yeah but -"But" my ass!
629
You said not only are we never gonna play ship's mast again but you also said if you ever do what you trying to do now to not only refuse but that I had permission to physically restrain your ass if necessary. Now did you or did you not say that?
630
- Well. - No no no no. Answer the question motherfucker.
631
Did you or did you not say that? Yes I said that. However... Whatever with your "however."
632
Look I know l said it and I know I meant it.
633
Damn skippy you meant it. Yeah but when l said it I didn't mean in America.
634
- Oh nigga please! - Really--
635
I meant we should never play ship's mast again in New Zealand or Australia.
636
You are such a liar.
637
Look I know what l said when I said it. But when I said it l didn't know I'd ever come to America.
638
And when I said it if l had known I was going to come to America and had the opportunity to play ship's mast with a fucking Vanishing Point Challenger I would've added a "however." Right?
639
Okay oddly enough I actually understood that.
640
However just because you talked yourself into some stupid shit doesn't mean I have lost my goddamn mind.
641
You need two people to play ship's mast and I ain't playing.
642
I'll be your best friend.
643
l don't need me no best friend lives on the other side of planet Earth.
644
- I'll crack your back. - You'll crack it anyway.
645
Well of course I'll crack it anyway.
646
But now while l'm here I'll be your back-cracking slave.
647
Whenever you want it you got it. You don't even have to ask for it.
648
You just order me to do it. Just be like...
649
"Bitch get over here and get busy." - You crack my back you'll give me foot massages... - Mm-hmm. Mmm. and after a shower you put moisturizer on my butt. Deal.
650
So we're gonna see if this guy'll let us take the car out without him.
651
If he does you wait here with Lee and we'll be back in a moment.
652
What?
653
I said we're gonna see if this guy'll let us take the car out without him. I heard what you said. I just can't believe what you said.
654
You know you two got some fucking balls. What?
655
Don't play dumbass with me. I've been up all night. I'm still a little drunk and I have a hangover.
656
l should be in my hotel room asleep not fucking around here on Tobacco Road. But because Zoë wanted to drive some fucking Vanishing Point car I'm here.
657
Now you two got the balls to ask me no scratch that, tell me l gotta go make conversation with Tom Joad while the cool kids get to go out and play?
658
Bullshit on that. - lt ain't like that. - Then what's it like Kim?
659
You guys are our collateral. He is never gonna go for it if we all go.
660
I really think one human being will be collateral enough.
661
You're not gonna wanna do what we're doing. What drive a car?
662
- Mmm. - We're doing more than that. What drive it fast?
663
We're doing more than that. Actually we're paying you a compliment 'cause we gonna do some stupid shit. But that's okay. We're stunt people. We ain't got good sense.
664
But you got good sense and anybody with good sense ain't gonna wanna do what we're doing.
665
How do you know I don't wanna do it? - 'Cause you're a mom. - Yeah.
666
You know we're supposed to be this big posse but that's the excuse you guys use whenever you want to exclude me from something.
667
So what is it you two daredevils are doing that I'm just so uncool I couldn't possibly understand?
668
You know we're kind of conning this guy so maybe it's best that we don't go into detail about it while he's watching us.
669
Besides he's probably not gonna let us do it anyway.
670
Okay. How about this?
671
I'll talk him into it. But if l talk him into it I go along.
672
- How you gonna do that? - Eh that's my problem.
673
But don't worry. He'll say yes.
674
What are you gonna do blow him?
675
No!
676
l'm gonna insinuate that Lee's gonna blow him.
677
That's good. Not really. But let me handle it. We got a deal?
678
Okay Mommy listen up.
679
You wanna hang with the cool kids you got to be cool.
680
We take you along you don't say shit.You don't even say crap.
681
You just sit in the back and I don't wanna hear a peep out of your ass you understand? - Got it.
682
You start nagging us we're pulling over to the side of the road kicking your ass out and picking you up later.
683
Agreed. Okay. Go work your magic.
684
- Hello sir. - Hello! - Hello. What's your name? - Jasper.
685
Hello Jasper. I'm Abernathy. - Aber... what? - Abernathy.
686
- What's your first name? - That is my first name.
687
What kind of first name is that? You know what? Just call me Abbie. Okay Abbie.
688
Jasper we were wondering if my friends and I could take the car out for a little test-drive out on our own. You know just to see if we're comfortable in it.
689
Why would I do something stupid like that? To better sell your automobile.
690
How do I know y'all ain't just gonna steal it?
691
Four reasons actually. One we're not thieves. Two that would be rude. Three we're staying at the Days lnn in town.
692
You can call the hotel check with management. We're registered for the next month.
693
Actually Zoë's not. But Kim and I are so we're totally track-downable.
694
Who's Kim? The colored girl? Yes. Kim would be the girl of color.
695
And reason number four and the most important while we're taking the car out for a little spin that'll give you a better opportunity to get acquainted with our other friend Lee.
696
Why does she look kind of familiar?
697
That would be because she's a famous actress. Oh.
698
Why is she dressed like that? Well you see we're making a Hollywood movie in town and it's a cheerleader movie and she's one of the cheerleaders.
699
What's a cheerleader movie? A movie about cheerleaders.
700
Is it a porno movie? Yes it is.
701
But don't mention it. She's shy.
702
Lee this is Jasper. Jasper Lee.
703
Now you two kids stay out of trouble.
704
