1
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,534
It was on my fourth birthday...

2
00:08:14,604 --> 00:08:16,931
When my aunt was reading
sei shonagon...

3
00:08:17,002 --> 00:08:19,574
That I saw my father and
his publisher together...

4
00:08:19,644 --> 00:08:21,938
For the first time.

5
00:08:22,007 --> 00:08:25,934
Though I'm certain that any clear
understanding of what I had witnessed...

6
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,679
Would have to wait
until I was much older.

7
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,804
On my sixth birthday...

8
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:25,141
At the matsuo tiasha shrine
in kyoto,

9
00:11:25,211 --> 00:11:27,226
Encouraged by my aunt,

10
00:11:27,297 --> 00:11:30,354
I vowed I would keep a diary.

11
00:11:30,425 --> 00:11:32,544
A pillow book of my own.

12
00:11:44,849 --> 00:11:48,220
I would fill it with
all manner of observations,

13
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,896
Just like sei shonagon.

14
00:11:50,966 --> 00:11:53,780
Perhaps one day, like her,

15
00:11:53,851 --> 00:11:56,839
I could fill it with accounts
of all my lovers.

16
00:14:32,969 --> 00:14:37,139
On the same day as I started
to keep my own pillow book,

17
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,857
I met my future husband
for the first time.

18
00:14:40,927 --> 00:14:43,916
I was six. He was ten.

19
00:14:43,986 --> 00:14:46,453
We did not exchange a word.

20
00:14:46,524 --> 00:14:49,373
He had been handpicked
by my father's publisher.

21
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,566
Like sei shonagon, my sense
of smell was very strong.

22
00:15:22,635 --> 00:15:26,110
I enjoyed the smell of paper
of all kinds.

23
00:15:26,181 --> 00:15:29,829
It reminded me
of the scent of skin.

24
00:16:54,116 --> 00:16:57,000
My mother had
taught me mandarin.

25
00:16:57,071 --> 00:16:59,468
When my father painted
a japanese greeting...

26
00:16:59,539 --> 00:17:02,214
On my face on my birthday,

27
00:17:02,284 --> 00:17:05,828
She played her favorite
chinese record.

28
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:10,313
It had been popular when my
parents had met in shanghai.

29
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,667
In remembrance of my father
and in memory of sei shonagon,

30
00:19:09,738 --> 00:19:12,344
I was determined to take lovers
who would remind me...

31
00:19:12,415 --> 00:19:15,472
Of the pleasures
of calligraphy.

32
00:19:15,543 --> 00:19:19,017
I could not be sure
which was more important...

33
00:19:19,088 --> 00:19:22,701
An indifferent calligrapher
who was a good lover...

34
00:19:22,772 --> 00:19:26,733
Or an excellent lover who
was a poor calligrapher.

35
00:23:05,424 --> 00:23:07,508
I became a wife.

36
00:23:09,386 --> 00:23:11,819
I married.

37
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,356
I acquired a husband.

38
00:23:15,366 --> 00:23:17,971
Whichever way you say it,

39
00:23:18,042 --> 00:23:20,891
It was bound to end badly.

40
00:23:23,429 --> 00:23:26,869
I had a ceremonial wedding
in style.

41
00:25:27,024 --> 00:25:29,734
Separated from my parents
and my aunt,

42
00:25:29,805 --> 00:25:33,767
I confided in my own pillow book
more and more frequently.

43
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:40,093
Like the pillow book of sei
shonagon, it was full of lists.

44
00:25:40,162 --> 00:25:43,603
Unlike sei shonagon,
all the lists were negative.

45
00:29:38,908 --> 00:29:41,340
That was the first fire.

46
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:43,878
There was to be a second.

47
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,831
Both fires marked
a big change in my life.

48
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:18,485
When I first arrived
in hong kong, I hid.

49
00:31:18,556 --> 00:31:23,144
I lived in kowloon city in the
cheapest rooming houses I could find.

50
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:26,515
I did not want to be found
by my parents...

51
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:28,634
Or by my husband.

52
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:42,433
I tried hard to improve the
chinese my mother had taught me.

53
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,468
In the meantime,
I was determined...

54
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:58,144
To keep alive
my father's tradition.

55
00:31:59,848 --> 00:32:03,948
I learned to type
on my 21st birthday,

56
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:07,180
I tried to give myself
my father's blessing.

57
00:33:13,915 --> 00:33:17,111
I found work in the offices
of a japanese designer.

58
00:33:21,596 --> 00:33:25,731
And I was determined to speak
english with an american accent.

59
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:29,485
I was planning
to go to california.

60
00:33:33,657 --> 00:33:38,000
Twenty meter of pale green
organdy, pattern 14.

61
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:42,763
A meter of type-b tulle.

62
00:33:45,613 --> 00:33:48,740
The small net size.

63
00:33:52,843 --> 00:33:55,588
The type-b tulle
with the small net size.

64
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:15,503
We went to kyoto,
back to japan,

65
00:34:15,573 --> 00:34:17,901
To work
in the matuso tiasha shrine,

66
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,751
Which sei shonagon
had visited regularly.

67
00:34:23,081 --> 00:34:26,103
I couldn't give up
such an opportunity.

68
00:34:26,174 --> 00:34:29,789
I was also a little homesick.

69
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:33,542
We didn't finish walking
the catwalk until midnight...

70
00:34:33,612 --> 00:34:36,670
When all the audience had gone.

71
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:39,658
Sei shonagon had watched
the moon rise in that garden...

72
00:34:39,729 --> 00:34:42,057
A thousand years ago.

73
00:34:42,128 --> 00:34:46,020
I could have walked up and down
that path all night long.

74
00:34:50,886 --> 00:34:53,979
You are not in a position
to preach clean living.

75
00:34:54,049 --> 00:34:58,219
Oh, yes, I am.
And in blood red.

76
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:00,340
You could join us.

77
00:35:00,409 --> 00:35:03,432
I'm too beautiful...
And too rich.

78
00:35:03,503 --> 00:35:07,152
- What's wealth got to do with it?
- A great deal, I'd think.

79
00:35:07,223 --> 00:35:09,793
I design material.
You can wear it.

80
00:35:09,864 --> 00:35:11,914
Frighten the buyers.

81
00:35:11,983 --> 00:35:14,033
Then I'd soon
cease to be wealthy.

82
00:35:17,789 --> 00:35:21,158
You wouldn't need to be paid.
You would do it for free.

83
00:35:21,229 --> 00:35:23,870
Oh, yeah?

84
00:35:23,941 --> 00:35:27,728
What else would you
do for free?

85
00:35:27,798 --> 00:35:30,751
I've been waiting to waste
my talent on your body...

86
00:35:30,822 --> 00:35:32,906
For a little reward.

87
00:35:34,889 --> 00:35:38,920
My search for the ideal
lover-calligrapher continued.

88
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:43,508
But it was becoming less and less
likely that I would find him.

89
00:35:43,578 --> 00:35:46,601
If they were old, they were
invariably in no position...

90
00:35:46,672 --> 00:35:50,077
To take advantage
of what I had to offer.

91
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:53,309
And if they were young, they
were often easily distracted.

92
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,838
It's them!

93
00:36:21,984 --> 00:36:25,390
Don't look! Don't look.

94
00:36:27,058 --> 00:36:29,770
What are you doing here?
Are you responsible for this?

95
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,376
You shrimp!
What do you think you're doing?

96
00:36:32,446 --> 00:36:34,496
Shut up!

97
00:37:27,467 --> 00:37:29,899
They were children
playing a game.

98
00:37:32,194 --> 00:37:35,599
They used hoki, the japanese
photographer from tokyo,

99
00:37:35,669 --> 00:37:37,789
As a pawn to find me.

100
00:37:37,858 --> 00:37:39,908
I want those photos.

101
00:37:39,979 --> 00:37:43,975
I had once kissed him on the
cheek in a moment of happiness.

102
00:37:44,046 --> 00:37:47,034
- You're a creep.
- I'm sorry.

103
00:37:47,104 --> 00:37:50,753
I have watched you,
followed you everywhere.

104
00:37:50,824 --> 00:37:54,020
It's only too obvious.
And I could help you.

105
00:37:54,091 --> 00:37:59,060
You haven't done
too well so far.

106
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:01,319
You are very beautiful.

107
00:38:26,067 --> 00:38:28,117
I employed a calligrapher...

108
00:38:28,186 --> 00:38:31,035
With an obsession
for mathematics.

109
00:38:31,106 --> 00:38:34,617
While his wife sang
and waited in the kitchen,

110
00:38:34,686 --> 00:38:38,613
This account clerk
filled my back with additions,

111
00:38:38,684 --> 00:38:41,255
My front with subtractions.

112
00:38:58,147 --> 00:39:00,789
I contacted
a magazine designer...

113
00:39:00,858 --> 00:39:05,306
Who insisted that I came back to his
apartment in the new territories,

114
00:39:05,377 --> 00:39:09,095
Where he could show me off to his
parents who wanted grandchildren.

115
00:39:10,486 --> 00:39:13,057
- Write "dear nagiko."
- What?

116
00:39:13,128 --> 00:39:16,150
- I took risks.
- Where?

117
00:39:16,222 --> 00:39:18,896
- Here.
- I can't.

118
00:39:18,967 --> 00:39:22,964
- Yes, you can.
- Who knows what casual meeting would produce a surprise.

119
00:39:23,033 --> 00:39:26,369
Nagiko?

120
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:29,741
Some of the great
japanese calligraphers...

121
00:39:29,811 --> 00:39:32,973
Were very modest
and unassuming men.

122
00:39:33,044 --> 00:39:37,492
Humble clerks by day,
daring poets by night.

123
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:43,296
Good. Now write
something else here.

124
00:39:52,751 --> 00:39:54,766
With great trepidation,

125
00:39:54,836 --> 00:39:58,033
I sought to move away
from what I knew best.

126
00:39:58,103 --> 00:40:01,613
After all, there were other
great calligraphic traditions.

127
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:18,539
What have you written?
That's for you to find out.

128
00:40:18,609 --> 00:40:20,659
How am I going to do that?

129
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:23,892
You know, some cultures
permit no images.

130
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:27,229
Perhaps some cultures ought
to permit no visible text.

131
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:30,253
I need writing.

132
00:40:30,323 --> 00:40:33,032
Don't ask me why.
Just take out your pen and,

133
00:40:33,103 --> 00:40:35,953
Please, write your name
on my arm.

134
00:40:36,023 --> 00:40:38,246
Go on.

135
00:40:38,317 --> 00:40:41,792
I met an english translator
at the cafe typo.

136
00:40:41,862 --> 00:40:45,024
He said he spoke four languages,
including yiddish.

137
00:41:10,364 --> 00:41:12,933
I'll give you another chance.

138
00:41:14,152 --> 00:41:16,201
Write on my back.

139
00:41:18,566 --> 00:41:21,275
Well, what shall I write?

140
00:41:21,347 --> 00:41:23,396
Write...

141
00:41:23,467 --> 00:41:26,454
"we met for the first time
at the cafe typo."

142
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,574
Write in three languages...

143
00:41:28,646 --> 00:41:31,807
Japanese, french and english.

144
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:17,721
Waitress!

145
00:42:30,686 --> 00:42:33,570
Are we going to do
more writing?

146
00:42:33,641 --> 00:42:36,142
Perhaps.

147
00:42:36,213 --> 00:42:38,993
You smell strange.

148
00:42:39,063 --> 00:42:42,121
Do you use perfume?

149
00:42:42,191 --> 00:42:44,206
And your fingers.

150
00:42:44,276 --> 00:42:46,848
What's wrong with my fingers?

151
00:42:48,517 --> 00:42:51,505
I'll give you another chance.
The last one.

152
00:42:55,884 --> 00:42:59,673
Write on my breasts.
A little inappropriate.

153
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:03,078
I'll decide what's
inappropriate.

154
00:43:03,149 --> 00:43:06,242
Write in yiddish.
What's yiddish for "breasts"?

155
00:43:06,311 --> 00:43:09,404
If you're a writer, surely
you'd write on anything?

156
00:43:43,294 --> 00:43:46,491
This is not going to work.

157
00:43:49,098 --> 00:43:51,182
You're not a writer.

158
00:43:51,252 --> 00:43:54,275
This is not writing;
It's scribbling.

159
00:43:54,346 --> 00:43:56,396
Distasteful scribbling.

160
00:43:58,586 --> 00:44:01,157
Get out.

161
00:44:01,228 --> 00:44:04,842
You're not a writer;
You're a scribbler.

162
00:44:04,913 --> 00:44:08,352
I've watched you with your little
typewriter go click, click, clack.

163
00:44:08,423 --> 00:44:11,620
Get out. Go!

164
00:44:15,234 --> 00:44:18,189
You could show me.

165
00:44:18,258 --> 00:44:21,559
- Go on.
- No. I can't.

166
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:24,341
How can I get pleasure
writing on you?

167
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:26,773
You have to write on me.

168
00:44:26,844 --> 00:44:29,484
Go on.

169
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:36,922
Use my body
like the pages of a book.

170
00:44:36,993 --> 00:44:39,043
Of your book.

171
00:47:20,107 --> 00:47:22,921
Not a special
writing instrument at all.

172
00:47:25,946 --> 00:47:27,926
I began very tentatively,

173
00:47:27,997 --> 00:47:33,071
Thinking of sei shonagon's
lists of anatomical comparisons.

174
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:35,399
The thoughts were often hers,

175
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:38,076
But the words
were entirely mine.

176
00:47:40,197 --> 00:47:44,228
For my first experiment
in using flesh as paper,

177
00:47:44,298 --> 00:47:49,406
I made a deal with an englishman who was
entirely ignorant of oriental languages.

178
00:47:58,305 --> 00:48:01,746
Hoki, this is where you can prove
you have my interests at heart.

179
00:48:01,816 --> 00:48:04,040
Come here quickly.

180
00:48:14,572 --> 00:48:17,873
Off you go.
Beautiful photographs.

181
00:48:17,943 --> 00:48:20,897
And you don't get paid
because you owe me.

182
00:48:33,132 --> 00:48:36,780
This is where I begin
to do the writing.

183
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:40,708
I'm now going to be the pen,
not just the paper.

184
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,519
I could help you.

185
00:49:35,591 --> 00:49:37,918
I think not.

186
00:49:37,989 --> 00:49:41,497
Why not? What's wrong with me?

187
00:49:41,568 --> 00:49:45,460
Because you are from kyoto,
and you're young.

188
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:48,935
And your handwriting
is illegible.

189
00:49:49,006 --> 00:49:53,905
Besides, your skin
does not make a good paper.

190
00:49:53,976 --> 00:49:56,060
Watch.

191
00:50:08,852 --> 00:50:13,300
You see? In my diary,
I called you "the blotter."

192
00:50:13,371 --> 00:50:15,421
Hoki the blotter.

193
00:50:22,825 --> 00:50:25,152
I could help you.

194
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:31,340
I think not.

195
00:50:31,409 --> 00:50:33,459
Why not?

196
00:50:36,866 --> 00:50:39,472
You're none too smart
with compliments.

197
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,169
Let me try.

198
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,097
Let me try.

199
00:52:04,558 --> 00:52:07,511
Hoki set off at dawn for
a foreign language bookshop...

200
00:52:07,581 --> 00:52:11,647
In kowloon city in a street
full of restaurants.

201
00:52:11,718 --> 00:52:14,428
He finally gave the packet
to some doorman.

202
00:52:19,365 --> 00:52:22,248
"We feel that we are unable
to consider...

203
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:25,376
"publication of this material.

204
00:52:25,447 --> 00:52:28,434
It's not worth the paper
it's written on."

205
00:52:36,083 --> 00:52:39,035
So they're not satisfied
with the quality of the paper.

206
00:52:42,026 --> 00:52:44,597
Perhaps it's not
japanese enough.

207
00:52:48,804 --> 00:52:51,097
Try writing on me.

208
00:52:59,786 --> 00:53:01,836
Seduce him.

209
00:56:11,436 --> 00:56:14,599
I met jerome in the cafe typo...

210
00:56:14,669 --> 00:56:18,317
And asked him for the services
of a translator.

211
00:56:19,744 --> 00:56:22,383
He gave me a choice
of six languages.

212
00:56:22,454 --> 00:56:26,173
They had increased by two.

213
00:56:26,243 --> 00:56:29,474
I talked to him
and I flattered him,

214
00:56:29,545 --> 00:56:33,054
And I admired all the books
he had yet to write.

215
00:57:07,778 --> 00:57:10,661
You have to sign here.

216
00:57:14,034 --> 00:57:17,508
Our first transaction
was strictly financial.

217
00:57:17,578 --> 00:57:22,235
He wanted to pay the bill
but had no money.

218
00:57:22,306 --> 00:57:27,483
He offered to write a check
but had no checkbook.

219
00:57:29,257 --> 00:57:32,732
I volunteered the palm
of my hand.

220
00:58:29,978 --> 00:58:33,314
If I could not seduce
the publisher,

221
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:39,396
Then perhaps I could seduce
the publisher's lover.

222
00:58:43,846 --> 00:58:46,139
His writing,
in so many languages,

223
00:58:46,208 --> 00:58:51,874
Made me a signpost pointing
east, west, north and south.

224
00:58:53,126 --> 00:58:56,496
I had shoes in german,
stockings in french,

225
00:58:56,567 --> 00:59:01,675
Gloves in hebrew,
a hat with a veil in italian.

226
00:59:01,745 --> 00:59:07,375
He only kept me naked where I was
most accustomed to wear clothes.

227
00:59:37,546 --> 00:59:41,958
Shut up. Go away. Go away.

228
01:03:25,550 --> 01:03:30,555
I would like to honor my
father by becoming a writer.

229
01:03:33,475 --> 01:03:37,263
I could help.

230
01:03:51,479 --> 01:03:54,398
I could learn new languages...

231
01:03:56,172 --> 01:03:59,055
To make you understood...

232
01:04:00,377 --> 01:04:02,948
All over the world.

233
01:04:59,533 --> 01:05:04,780
When god made
his first human being...

234
01:05:04,851 --> 01:05:08,292
He painted in the eyes.

235
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,461
And lips.

236
01:05:58,481 --> 01:06:01,086
And the sex.

237
01:06:17,111 --> 01:06:20,759
And when god approved
of his creation...

238
01:06:21,907 --> 01:06:24,860
He was obliged
to sign his name.

239
01:06:59,758 --> 01:07:04,136
There are so many publishers in the world.
Why worry about this one?

240
01:07:06,015 --> 01:07:08,620
I have my reasons.

241
01:07:10,602 --> 01:07:14,006
I suspect it's because
he rejected you so swiftly,

242
01:07:14,077 --> 01:07:16,441
And few people, if any,
have ever done that.

243
01:07:17,484 --> 01:07:19,569
Perhaps.

244
01:07:24,053 --> 01:07:28,361
But... If you're so determined
to be published by him,

245
01:07:28,432 --> 01:07:32,359
The publisher who rejects
you and who loves me...

246
01:07:33,958 --> 01:07:36,634
Then I have a plan.

247
01:07:38,511 --> 01:07:42,751
I could be your messenger.
You could write on me.

248
01:07:42,822 --> 01:07:46,852
And with your permission and, of
course, your blessing, I could...

249
01:07:46,923 --> 01:07:49,842
Pay your publishing friend
a visit?

250
01:07:51,963 --> 01:07:54,221
A sacrifice?

251
01:07:54,292 --> 01:07:56,584
But not without pleasure
for you?

252
01:07:56,654 --> 01:07:59,260
Perhaps.

253
01:07:59,331 --> 01:08:01,485
You could be jealous?

254
01:08:02,459 --> 01:08:04,440
Vtamo?

255
01:11:34,546 --> 01:11:37,603
It's worked. He won't let me go.
Wait for me.

256
01:11:37,674 --> 01:11:39,724
He's thinking
of an edition of 3,000...

257
01:11:39,794 --> 01:11:42,192
If there are more, and there
will be more, won't there?

258
01:11:42,263 --> 01:11:44,277
I'll see you this evening.
Wait for me here.

259
01:11:44,348 --> 01:11:47,405
Hey, you are enjoying
it too much.

260
01:11:47,476 --> 01:11:52,028
But with your permission. And only
according to the quality of the writing.

261
01:11:52,099 --> 01:11:56,407
If you don't hurry it along, I'll
be looking for someone else.

262
01:11:56,477 --> 01:11:58,527
You dare.

263
01:12:38,847 --> 01:12:41,696
He's making me wait.
Buy some new paper.

264
01:12:41,767 --> 01:12:47,014
Don't get so upset.
You could use me.

265
01:12:47,084 --> 01:12:50,107
Give me two more of these and some
more of this and some stuff for him.

266
01:12:50,177 --> 01:12:53,340
You could have babies.

267
01:12:53,409 --> 01:12:58,449
- They're not bad-looking ladies.
- I need some skin, two meters and a half.

268
01:12:58,519 --> 01:13:00,639
- Sorry?
- Back and front.

269
01:13:00,708 --> 01:13:04,948
I could give you
three and a half.

270
01:13:05,019 --> 01:13:10,023
True, but the quality of the paper would
not attract my fastidious publisher.

271
01:13:10,753 --> 01:13:15,132
Jerome! Jerome.

272
01:13:15,202 --> 01:13:19,616
Jerome! Jerome.

273
01:13:21,841 --> 01:13:23,925
Jerome!

274
01:13:31,259 --> 01:13:33,518
Jerome!

275
01:13:35,708 --> 01:13:38,245
Jerome!

276
01:13:38,316 --> 01:13:40,712
Jerome!

277
01:14:32,745 --> 01:14:36,080
I need you both. Come with me?

278
01:14:36,151 --> 01:14:38,966
I really do.
It's like wild kingdom.

279
01:14:41,956 --> 01:14:44,283
All right, you're gonna like this one.
This one's funny.

280
01:14:44,353 --> 01:14:47,313
Okay. There are these two lesbians, all right?
And one says to the other...

281
01:16:17,885 --> 01:16:21,013
Keep going. Keep going.
It felt good.

282
01:16:21,082 --> 01:16:23,167
It felt good, I swear to god.

283
01:16:23,238 --> 01:16:26,573
You know something? If
you had a pair of tits...

284
01:16:26,643 --> 01:16:29,528
Hey, you know something? They got
a song about you in america.

285
01:16:29,598 --> 01:16:32,065
You know what it's called?
It's called "the hokeypokey."

286
01:16:32,135 --> 01:16:35,367
You get it? "The hokeypokey."

287
01:16:35,438 --> 01:16:38,704
Ready? You put your right foot
in you put your right foot out

288
01:16:38,774 --> 01:16:41,693
your put your right foot in
and you shake it all about

289
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:44,751
you do the hokeypokey.
You turn your...

290
01:16:44,822 --> 01:16:47,010
Hello. Sorry.

291
01:16:47,081 --> 01:16:50,347
Americans always say
they have nothing to hide.

292
01:16:50,418 --> 01:16:52,746
I can see that's true.

293
01:16:52,816 --> 01:16:55,039
Look what I got here?
It is a menu.

294
01:16:55,109 --> 01:16:57,507
It's a menu to my very own restaurant.
So you come on in.

295
01:16:57,578 --> 01:17:01,817
No, get off! Come on in. And you've known
me a long time. I'll let you in free.

296
01:17:01,888 --> 01:17:03,972
Moo goo gai pan
and all that stuff.

297
01:17:04,043 --> 01:17:06,718
You wanna come in?

298
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:10,923
How 'bout a little kiss? How 'bout you
kiss me in the hay? How does that sound?

299
01:17:10,994 --> 01:17:13,911
Love me a long time, baby,
love me a long...

300
01:18:37,434 --> 01:18:41,188
nagiko? C'est moi.
C'est jerome.

301
01:18:41,257 --> 01:18:45,254
Nagiko?

302
01:18:45,324 --> 01:18:45,824
Nagiko!

303
01:18:50,850 --> 01:18:52,934
Nagiko...

304
01:18:55,091 --> 01:18:58,704
Nagiko! Nagiko!

305
01:18:58,775 --> 01:19:02,110
I know you're there! Let me in!

306
01:19:02,181 --> 01:19:05,517
Don't play games!
I know you're there!

307
01:19:06,839 --> 01:19:10,418
Nagiko!

308
01:19:10,487 --> 01:19:15,040
I met your friend.
I met your fat friend.

309
01:19:15,111 --> 01:19:17,682
He was nice? Was he nice?

310
01:19:17,752 --> 01:19:23,486
He was covered in my paint!
My paint for my body!

311
01:19:23,557 --> 01:19:27,727
Nagiko! Nagiko!

312
01:19:32,177 --> 01:19:35,965
Nagiko! Nagiko!

313
01:19:40,345 --> 01:19:43,993
Oh, my god! What have I done?
What have I done?

314
01:19:44,062 --> 01:19:46,704
I'll make it... make it up!

315
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:53,829
Please let me in!

316
01:19:55,777 --> 01:19:58,486
I love you, nagiko.

317
01:19:58,556 --> 01:20:01,372
I love you. Talk to me.

318
01:20:02,831 --> 01:20:05,750
Nagiko!

319
01:20:05,821 --> 01:20:07,905
Please!

320
01:20:09,888 --> 01:20:12,180
I won't play games.

321
01:20:12,251 --> 01:20:15,239
Let me in! Let me in!

322
01:20:15,309 --> 01:20:17,290
Let me in!

323
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:02,892
Hoki, why won't she talk to me?

324
01:21:02,961 --> 01:21:06,193
- Nagiko, why won't she talk to me?
- I don't know.

325
01:21:06,264 --> 01:21:08,304
What do you mean, you don't know?
Have you seen her?

326
01:21:08,314 --> 01:21:11,059
When did you last see her?

327
01:21:23,747 --> 01:21:25,796
Oi.

328
01:21:31,915 --> 01:21:34,138
Whiskey.

329
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:36,640
Whiskey.

330
01:21:52,351 --> 01:21:57,946
She comes here, you know,
to pick up her clients.

331
01:21:58,017 --> 01:22:01,214
She almost lives here.

332
01:22:05,524 --> 01:22:09,416
The waiters are all pimps.

333
01:22:30,688 --> 01:22:36,074
She makes sure
they are very smooth-skinned.

334
01:22:38,752 --> 01:22:41,567
You know? Between the legs?

335
01:22:41,636 --> 01:22:44,346
Her maid usually washes them...

336
01:22:44,417 --> 01:22:48,760
With lemon juice
to make their skin soft...

337
01:22:48,831 --> 01:22:51,020
And smooth.

338
01:22:53,106 --> 01:22:55,990
But you could scare her.

339
01:22:56,060 --> 01:22:58,319
You are a writer,

340
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:03,393
Like in romeo and juliet.

341
01:23:06,383 --> 01:23:09,302
Shakespeare?

342
01:28:03,833 --> 01:28:08,211
Jerome? Jerome? Jerome?

343
01:28:08,282 --> 01:28:11,235
Jerome? Jerome? I'm sorry.

344
01:28:11,306 --> 01:28:13,911
We can start again
from where we left off.

345
01:28:13,982 --> 01:28:16,866
I was angry. You deceived me...

346
01:28:16,936 --> 01:28:22,427
With a man I detest, with a man
who blackmailed my father.

347
01:28:22,498 --> 01:28:25,277
But... We can revenge him.

348
01:28:25,348 --> 01:28:27,432
We need to work.

349
01:28:58,645 --> 01:29:00,729
Jerome.

350
01:29:02,329 --> 01:29:04,970
Jerome?

351
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:09,279
Jerome! Jerome! Jerome!

352
01:29:11,401 --> 01:29:13,485
Jerome!

353
01:31:58,895 --> 01:32:01,987
Jerome always wanted
to be foreign,

354
01:32:02,057 --> 01:32:05,567
Though not
necessarily oriental.

355
01:32:06,820 --> 01:32:09,147
English wasn't enough for him.

356
01:32:09,218 --> 01:32:12,067
He'd never have made a writer.

357
01:32:12,138 --> 01:32:14,326
He didn't have
enough imagination.

358
01:32:14,397 --> 01:32:17,524
Jerome was dyslexic
until he was 12,

359
01:32:17,594 --> 01:32:21,485
Before it became fashionable.

360
01:32:21,556 --> 01:32:25,692
And he broke every pair
of glasses I gave him.

361
01:32:25,761 --> 01:32:28,576
He hated wearing glasses.

362
01:32:28,647 --> 01:32:31,774
He was very good
at breaking things,

363
01:32:31,845 --> 01:32:35,735
Especially relationships,
just like his father.

364
01:32:35,806 --> 01:32:41,783
His father was a catholic convert,
always experimenting with faith.

365
01:32:41,854 --> 01:32:45,433
We called our first son paul
and our second jerome...

366
01:32:45,504 --> 01:32:50,159
After his father's confessor,
who was a jesuit in singapore.

367
01:32:52,385 --> 01:32:55,200
Jerome never liked me.

368
01:32:55,270 --> 01:32:58,120
He preferred my sister,

369
01:32:58,191 --> 01:33:01,352
A little fool who was excited
by modern literature.

370
01:33:01,423 --> 01:33:07,052
All swear words and scatology,
before it became fashionable.

371
01:33:08,408 --> 01:33:11,187
I hear you're fashionable.

372
01:33:11,258 --> 01:33:14,942
I suppose that's
what excited jerome.

373
01:33:27,664 --> 01:33:31,103
We burned an effigy
of jerome's car.

374
01:33:31,175 --> 01:33:34,371
We didn't burn his books.

375
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:36,839
They were too damp.

376
01:34:42,426 --> 01:34:44,961
I burned my books...

377
01:34:45,032 --> 01:34:47,985
And my clothes and shoes...

378
01:34:48,056 --> 01:34:51,809
And the photographs
and diaries.

379
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:56,120
It was the second major fire
in my life.

380
01:34:56,190 --> 01:34:59,733
The first fire had taken me
out of japan.

381
01:34:59,805 --> 01:35:04,183
The second took me back.

382
01:39:15,337 --> 01:39:17,700
Hoki wrote to me.

383
01:39:17,771 --> 01:39:22,079
Even after jerome's death,
he was still very, very jealous.

384
01:39:22,150 --> 01:39:26,842
He wrote to tell me about the
publisher's act of sacrilege.

385
01:39:26,911 --> 01:39:30,943
I had promised jerome 13 books.

386
01:39:31,014 --> 01:39:34,314
I could not now write them
on jerome's body.

387
01:39:34,384 --> 01:39:38,136
I found substitutes in japan.

388
01:39:38,208 --> 01:39:41,300
I would write the books for
the publisher as a bargain...

389
01:39:41,371 --> 01:39:45,783
For the return of the pillow book
he had made of jerome's body.

390
01:39:51,972 --> 01:39:54,369
Now you've been signed by me,

391
01:39:54,439 --> 01:39:56,976
You can go and do my business.

392
01:43:14,604 --> 01:43:17,766
Excuse me. Can I see
the manager, please?

393
01:43:42,515 --> 01:43:45,120
Let's take another photograph.

394
01:44:02,811 --> 01:44:06,392
Excuse me. Give it to the manager
and tell him we are here.

395
01:57:53,051 --> 01:57:56,804
This is the writing
of Nagiko Yujikino,

396
01:57:56,875 --> 01:57:59,306
And I know you
to have blackmailed,

397
01:57:59,376 --> 01:58:02,677
Violated and humiliated
my father.

398
01:58:02,749 --> 01:58:07,161
I suspect you also
of ruining my husband.

399
01:58:07,232 --> 01:58:10,706
You have now committed
the greatest crime.

400
01:58:10,777 --> 01:58:14,460
You have desecrated
the body of my lover.

401
01:58:14,531 --> 01:58:16,962
You and I now know...

402
01:58:17,033 --> 01:58:20,856
That you have lived
long enough.

403
02:00:46,663 --> 02:00:49,581
Today, I am 28 years old.

404
02:00:49,651 --> 02:00:54,585
And on my 28th birthday
I have experiences enough...

405
02:00:54,656 --> 02:00:56,845
To write my own pillow book.

406
02:00:56,916 --> 02:00:59,034
Think of that.

407
02:01:08,837 --> 02:01:12,938
The pillow book
of Nagiko Kiyohara.

408
02:01:21,523 --> 02:01:23,991
I can now make my own list
of things...

409
02:01:24,060 --> 02:01:26,563
That make
the heart beat faster.
