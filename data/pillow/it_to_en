1
It was the day of my 4th birthday while my aunt read Six Shonagon

2
that I saw my father and his publisher together for the first time.

3
To clearly understand what I had witnessed

4
I should have expected to be much bigger.

5
On the day of my 6th birthday, in the Matsuo Tiasha temple in Kyoto,

6
encouraged by my aunt, I solemnly promised that I would keep an intimate diary. My Pillow Book.

7
I would have filled him with all sorts of remarks, like Six Shonagon.

8
And maybe one day, like her, I could fill it with stories about all my lovers.

9
The same day I started to keep my intimate diary,

10
I met my future groom for the first time.

11
I was 6 and he was 10.

12
We did not exchange a word.

13
It had been carefully chosen by my father's publisher.

14
Like Six Shonagon, my sense of smell was very developed.

15
The smell of every kind of paper delighted me.

16
He reminded me of the perfume of the skin.

17
My mother had taught me Mandarin language.

18
When my father, on my birthday, painted a Japanese wish for her face, she made her favorite Chinese disc play.

19
She had been in vogue when my parents met in Shanghai.

20
In memory of my father and in memory of Six Shonagon, I was determined to find lovers

21
to remind me of the pleasures of calligraphy.

22
I could not be sure of what was most important:

23
a mediocre calligrapher who was a good lover

24
or an exceptional lover that was a bad calligraphy.

25
I become a wife.

26
I got married.

27
I had a husband.

28
Anyway, it was supposed to end badly.

29
My was a solemn wedding in perfect style.

30
Separated by my parents and my aunt,

31
I was always more and more confident with my diary.

32
Like Six Shonagon, he was full of remarks.

33
But my, unlike her, were all negative.

34
It was the first fire.

35
There would be a second.

36
Both marked a big change in my life.

37
Just arrived in Hong Kong and hid myself.

38
I lived in Kowloon City, in the nicest furnished rooms I could find.

39
I did not want my parents or my husband to find me.

40
I tried to improve the Chinese that my mother had taught me.

41
At the same time, I was determined to keep my father's traditions alive.

42
And my day

43
I tried to give my father's blessing on my own.

44
I found work in the offices of a Japanese designer.

45
I was determined to learn to speak without my emphasis on origin

46
and I dreamed of going to California.

47

48

49
Yeah, with a thick sleeve.

50
Pink tulle type

51
We went to Kyoto, back to Japan, to work in the temple of Matsuo Tiasha, of whom Six Shonagon had been a frequent attendant.

52
I could not give up such an occasion.

53
I felt a bit of nostalgia for my land.

54
I continued to walk on the catwalk until late at night until the last spectators were gone.

55
Six Shonagon had admired the moon rising in that garden 1000 years earlier.

56
I could continue to go on and on, on and off ... all night.

57
You are not in the condition of preaching an irreproachable life.

58
Oh sÃ ¬, so! I could write it with blood!

59
Why do not you join us?

60
No, I'm too beautiful and too rich.

61
- What's the matter with the wealth? - I think so much.

62
I could draw the cloth and wear it.

63
Just to terrorize customers.

64
So you will not be rich.

65
And then you could not afford to pay me. Well, but you will not be paid. - You'll have to work for nothing. - Ah sÃ¬? What would you do for free?

66
I would be willing to waste my talent on your body.

67
- In exchange for very little. - No!

68
My quest for the ideal calligraphic lover continued.

69
But it was less and less likely I could find it.

70
If they were old, they could not take any advantage from what I had to offer.

71
And if they were young, they often distracted easily.

72
And yes! Are they!

73
- Do not look! - I do not watch.

74
What are you doing here? Are you the manager, huh?

75
Shut up! - What do you think you're doing? - Shut up!

76
They were just the boys they played.

77
To find me they used Hoki, the photographer of the Kyoto parade, like a pawn.

78
I want those photographs!

79
Once I had kissed her on the cheek in a moment of happiness.

80
You're a vermouth! I apologize, I followed you from Japan.

81
I've followed you everywhere. This is obvious. I can help you. Well, so far you have not done much!

82
You're so beautiful!

83
Taken to my slopes a calligrapher with obsession for math.

84
As his wife waited in the kitchen singing, that accountant filled me with the back of the additions and the chest of subtractions.

85
Then I met the chart of a magazine

86
who insisted on why I visited her home in the New Territories. Actually he just wanted to get caught up because his parents wanted grandchildren.

87
- He writes: "Dear Nagiko." - Thing?

88
- Sometimes I was risking. - But where...?

89
- Here. - I can not!

90
You can. In the casualty there is often a surprise.

91
"Cara Nagiko"?

92
Some of the great Japanese calligraphers were very shy men and extreme modesty.

93
Humble daytime scribes, daring poets at night.

94
Very well. Now write something else here. Though trepidation, I tried to get away from what I knew best.

95
After all, there were other great calligraphic traditions.

96
What did you write? It's up to you to find out. Yeah, but why and why?

97
Nagiko, certain cultures forbid the images.

98
While others might have to forbid writing.

99
I need writing.

100
Do not ask me why. Pull out your pen and ...

101
Please write your name here.

102
Courage.

103
One night I met an Englishman at CaffÃ¨ Typo, a translator.

104
He said to speak 4 languages, including Yiddish.

105
Give you another chance.

106
Write me on my back.

107
But ... what do I have to write?

108
Write ...

109
"We met at CaffÃ¨ Typo."

110
I write it in 3 languages.

111
Japanese, French and another one of your choice.

112
Waitress!

113
Do you want me to write again?

114
It can be.

115
I can not understand your smell. Use a scent. And then your fingers ... What's wrong with my fingers?

116
I'll give you another chance. The last.

117
Write me on my breast. Well, I do not know if it's the case ...

118
What? I decide whether it is the case or not!

119
Write in yiddish! How do you say breast in yiddish?

120
If you are a writer, you can write anywhere.

121
It is not a great performance.

122
You are not a writer.

123
This is not writing, it is scribbling.

124
It's just a scribble.

125
Get out!

126
You are not a writer. You're a scribble!

127
I've watched you with your small typewriter by clicking-clac.

128
Get out! Get lost!

129
Teach me.

130
- Power. - No! Seriously?

131
What pleasure can I make writing about you?

132
- You have to write about me! - Forward.

133
Use my body as the pages of a book.

134
Of your book.

135
An instrument of writing nothing at all extraordinary.

136
I started thinking about experimental processing

137
of the Six Shonagon Anatomical Comparison List.

138
The ideas were often her but the words were just mine.

139
For my first writing experiment on the flesh, I made an agreement with an Englishman for whom even the simplest ideogram was a sign of no sense.

140
Hockey, if you care about my interests, it's time to prove it to me.

141
Come now.

142
Up, get to work and do your best. But I will not pay you, you're still in debt.

143
From now on I will write.

144
From now on the pen will be the pen and not the simple card.

145
I could be useful to you.

146
I do not think so.

147
Why? What am I supposed to do?

148
Because you're in Kyoto and you're young.

149
And you have an illegible writing.

150
Also your skin as a card is not worth much.

151
He's gonna see.

152
Did you see? Do you know how I nicknamed you in my diary?

153
Sponge skin.

154
But I could help you.

155
I do not think it's appropriate.

156
Why?

157
You're not very clever in complimenting.

158
Let me try.

159
Come on, let me try.

160
Hoki will go out at dawn to go to Kowloon City on a busy street where they will deliver the pack to a salesman.

161
"We do not think the conditions for publishing your material exist, and it is not worth the paper on which it is written."

162
They also despise the quality of the paper.

163
Maybe it's not quite Japanese.

164
Use me, try to write to me.

165
Seduction of a man ...

166
I met Jerome at CaffÃ¨ Typo and asked him for his performance as a translator.

167
I will offer you the choice between 6 languages.

168
She had learned two more.

169
I talked to him for a long time, worshiping him.

170
Showing admiration for all the books he still had to write.

171
You have to sign here.

172
Our first report was strictly financial.

173
He wanted to pay the bill but did not have any money.

174
He offered to sign a check but he did not have the booklet.

175
I offered him the palm of my hand.

176
I could not seduce the publisher. But maybe I could seduce her lover.

177
His writing in so many languages ​​turned me into a living stele pointing to the east, west, north, and south.

178
I had German shoes, French socks, Jewish gloves, a hat with Russian vests.

179
The only points I did not write about were those I covered with the garments.

180
Stay silent, get out! Get lost!

181
I would like to honor my writer.

182
I could help you.

183
I could learn other languages.

184
So you could read them all over the world.

185
When God created the first human being, he painted on his eyes, lips and sex.

186
And when God was pleased with his creation, he was obliged to sign it with his name.

187
There are so many publishers in the world, because he is?

188
I have my good reasons.

189
I suspect it's because it has cleared you so abruptly and a few people, maybe none, never did.

190
It can be.

191
If you are so determined to get published by him, a publisher who does not consider you, and who loves me, then I have an idea.

192
I could make you a messenger. You could write about me.

193
And with your permission and your blessing, I could ... Go visit your friend publisher.

194
What an abnegation!

195
But I'm sure you will not enjoy it, do not you think so?

196
It can be.

197
Would you be jealous?

198
They went and copied everything. He's waiting for me.

199
He is thinking of an altogether

200
You'll do them, do not you?

201
- See you tonight, here in front of you. - Hey!

202
You are taking too much taste.

203
But I have your permission. And then it's just editorial needs.

204
If you do not mind, I'll look for someone else.

205
Try it.

206
He dared let me wait. Buy the other card.

207
Do not get angry. Why do not you use me?

208
Still two of these and brings something for him too.

209
She could scare a son!

210
Nothing wrong, huh? I need human skin. - 2 and a half feet.

211
- You are welcome? Front and back.

212
I could give you three and a half!

213
I believe it. Only my controversial publisher is very demanding regarding the quality of the paper.

214
Jerome!

215
Jerome!

216
Serve me both. Come with me?

217
Come on, let's go! You're fabulous!

218
One bet, I swear to God!

219
Do you know what?

220
There's a song about you in America, do you know how it's called?

221
It is called "Ice cream"!

222
The lady said that I ...

223
Ready? Pull out one foot, pull the other out! Then make a twist. I'm thirsty so much! But you lick the gelatin, lick the jelly!

224
- Hi dear. - Nagiko!

225
Americans always say they have nothing to hide.

226
And apparently it is true!

227
What's this stuff? What kind of printed cabbage?

228
This is a menu!

229
Nagiko!

230
I know you're there, let me in!

231
Do not play, I know you are there!

232
Nagiko!

233
I saw your friend. Your friend cries.

234
She was really cute, pretty cute ...

235
It was covered by my ink. That ink was for my body.

236
Nagiko! What have I done? What have I done?

237
Nagiko, let me in.

238
I love you, Nagiko!

239
I love you, speak to me!

240
Nagiko!

241
Please!

242
I'm not playing!

243
Let me in! Let me in!

244
Why do not you want to talk to me?

245
I do not know.

246
How do you not know? When did you last see it?

247
Whiskey.

248
Whiskey.

249
She comes here just to choose, look for her customers.

250
She comes here, she turns and chooses.

251
All the waiters make them ruffian.

252
They point to customers who have very smooth skin.

253
Even in the middle of the legs.

254
Then her waitress washed them long with lemon juice to make their skin soft and smooth.

255
But you can scare her.

256
You are a writer.

257
Do you remember Juliet and Romeo?

258
Shakespeare.

259
Jerome!

260
Jerome, I apologize.

261
Let's start over as if nothing had happened.

262
I was furious, you deceived me.

263
Just with the man I hate, the man who reared my father.

264
But we can avenge him.

265
But we have to work.

266
Jerome!

267
Jerome!

268
He had always wanted to be a stranger. Although not necessarily Oriental.

269
Our culture was tight to him.

270
But he would never have become a writer.

271
He did not have enough imagination.

272
Jerome was dyslexic up to 12 years before the thing became fashionable.

273
He smashed all the pairs of glasses I was giving him.

274
She hated wearing glasses.

275
But it was great to break things up.

276
Especially the relationships, like her father.

277
His father was a converted Catholic. Always with the anxiety of experiencing her faith.

278
The first child we called Paul, the second Jerome by the name of his father's confessor, a Jesuit who lived in Singapore.

279
Jerome never liked me.

280
She preferred my sister. An insolent wandering guy who was crazy about modern literature, obscenities, blasphemies, and scatology before they became fashionable.

281
I've heard that she is also fashionable.

282
I guess it was to excite Jerome.

283
We burned an echo of Jerome's car but not his books.

284
They were too moist.

285
I burned my books, my clothes, shoes, photos, and diaries.

286
It was the second great fire in my life.

287
The first had left me from Japan. The second made me come back.

288
Hoki wrote to me.

289
Even after Jerome's death he continued to be very jealous.

290
He had written to inform me about the publisher's sacred act.

291
I had promised 13 books to Jerome.

292
Since I could not write it on her body,

293
I found substitutes in Japan.

294
I would have written the books for the publisher in return for the return of the intimate diary in which he had transformed Jerome's body.

295
Now that you've been signed, do it and do what I told you.

296
Excuse me, can I see the director?

297
Let's take another picture.

298
Sorry, from the manager and tell him we are here.

299
This is what Nagiko Yoshikino writes:

300
"I know for sure that she has blackmailed, offended, humiliated, raped my father.

301
I suspect, too, that she is the cause of my husband's ruin.

302
Now he has committed the greatest crime.

303
He profaned my lover's body.

304
Now we both know that she has lived enough. "

305
Today I'm 28 years old.

306
It's my birthday and I already have enough experience writing my intimate diary.

307
Think of Nagiko Kiyohara's "Pillow Book".

308
Now I can draw up a list of things that speed up the heartbeats.

309

310

311
