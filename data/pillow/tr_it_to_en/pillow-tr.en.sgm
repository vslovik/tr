<seg id="1"> It was the day of my 4th birthday while my aunt read Six Shonagon </seg>
<seg id="2"> that I saw my father and his publisher together for the first time. </seg>
<seg id="3"> To clearly understand what I had witnessed </seg>
<seg id="4"> I should have expected to be much bigger. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On the day of my 6th birthday, in the Matsuo Tiasha temple in Kyoto, </seg>
<seg id="6"> encouraged by my aunt, I solemnly promised that I would keep an intimate diary. My Pillow Book. </seg>
<seg id="7"> I would have filled him with all sorts of remarks, like Six Shonagon. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And maybe one day, like her, I could fill it with stories about all my lovers. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The same day I started to keep my intimate diary, </seg>
<seg id="10"> I met my future groom for the first time. </seg>
<seg id="11"> I was 6 and he was 10. </seg>
<seg id="12"> We did not exchange a word. </seg>
<seg id="13"> It had been carefully chosen by my father's publisher. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Like Six Shonagon, my sense of smell was very developed. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The smell of every kind of paper delighted me. </seg>
<seg id="16"> He reminded me of the perfume of the skin. </seg>
<seg id="17"> My mother had taught me Mandarin language. </seg>
<seg id="18"> When my father, on my birthday, painted a Japanese wish for her face, she made her favorite Chinese disc play. </seg>
<seg id="19"> She had been in vogue when my parents met in Shanghai. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In memory of my father and in memory of Six Shonagon, I was determined to find lovers </seg>
<seg id="21"> to remind me of the pleasures of calligraphy. </seg>
<seg id="22"> I could not be sure of what was most important: </seg>
<seg id="23"> a mediocre calligrapher who was a good lover </seg>
<seg id="24"> or an exceptional lover that was a bad calligraphy. </seg>
<seg id="25"> I become a wife. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I got married. </seg>
<seg id="27"> I had a husband. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Anyway, it was supposed to end badly. </seg>
<seg id="29"> My was a solemn wedding in perfect style. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Separated by my parents and my aunt, </seg>
<seg id="31"> I was always more and more confident with my diary. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Like Six Shonagon, he was full of remarks. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But my, unlike her, were all negative. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It was the first fire. </seg>
<seg id="35"> There would be a second. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Both marked a big change in my life. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Just arrived in Hong Kong and hid myself. </seg>
<seg id="38"> I lived in Kowloon City, in the nicest furnished rooms I could find. </seg>
<seg id="39"> I did not want my parents or my husband to find me. </seg>
<seg id="40"> I tried to improve the Chinese that my mother had taught me. </seg>
<seg id="41"> At the same time, I was determined to keep my father's traditions alive. </seg>
<seg id="42"> And my day </seg>
<seg id="43"> I tried to give my father's blessing on my own. </seg>
<seg id="44"> I found work in the offices of a Japanese designer. </seg>
<seg id="45"> I was determined to learn to speak without my emphasis on origin </seg>
<seg id="46"> and I dreamed of going to California. </seg>
<seg id="47">  </seg>
<seg id="48">  </seg>
<seg id="49"> Yeah, with a thick sleeve. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Pink tulle type </seg>
<seg id="51"> We went to Kyoto, back to Japan, to work in the temple of Matsuo Tiasha, of whom Six Shonagon had been a frequent attendant. </seg>
<seg id="52"> I could not give up such an occasion. </seg>
<seg id="53"> I felt a bit of nostalgia for my land. </seg>
<seg id="54"> I continued to walk on the catwalk until late at night until the last spectators were gone. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Six Shonagon had admired the moon rising in that garden 1000 years earlier. </seg>
<seg id="56"> I could continue to go on and on, on and off ... all night. </seg>
<seg id="57"> You are not in the condition of preaching an irreproachable life. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Oh sÃ ¬, so! I could write it with blood! </seg>
<seg id="59"> Why do not you join us? </seg>
<seg id="60"> No, I'm too beautiful and too rich. </seg>
<seg id="61"> - What's the matter with the wealth? - I think so much. </seg>
<seg id="62"> I could draw the cloth and wear it. </seg>
<seg id="63"> Just to terrorize customers. </seg>
<seg id="64"> So you will not be rich. </seg>
<seg id="65"> And then you could not afford to pay me. Well, but you will not be paid. - You'll have to work for nothing. - Ah sÃ¬? What would you do for free? </seg>
<seg id="66"> I would be willing to waste my talent on your body. </seg>
<seg id="67"> - In exchange for very little. - No! </seg>
<seg id="68"> My quest for the ideal calligraphic lover continued. </seg>
<seg id="69"> But it was less and less likely I could find it. </seg>
<seg id="70"> If they were old, they could not take any advantage from what I had to offer. </seg>
<seg id="71"> And if they were young, they often distracted easily. </seg>
<seg id="72"> And yes! Are they! </seg>
<seg id="73"> - Do not look! - I do not watch. </seg>
<seg id="74"> What are you doing here? Are you the manager, huh? </seg>
<seg id="75"> Shut up! - What do you think you're doing? - Shut up! </seg>
<seg id="76"> They were just the boys they played. </seg>
<seg id="77"> To find me they used Hoki, the photographer of the Kyoto parade, like a pawn. </seg>
<seg id="78"> I want those photographs! </seg>
<seg id="79"> Once I had kissed her on the cheek in a moment of happiness. </seg>
<seg id="80"> You're a vermouth! I apologize, I followed you from Japan. </seg>
<seg id="81"> I've followed you everywhere. This is obvious. I can help you. Well, so far you have not done much! </seg>
<seg id="82"> You're so beautiful! </seg>
<seg id="83"> Taken to my slopes a calligrapher with obsession for math. </seg>
<seg id="84"> As his wife waited in the kitchen singing, that accountant filled me with the back of the additions and the chest of subtractions. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Then I met the chart of a magazine </seg>
<seg id="86"> who insisted on why I visited her home in the New Territories. Actually he just wanted to get caught up because his parents wanted grandchildren. </seg>
<seg id="87"> - He writes: "Dear Nagiko." - Thing? </seg>
<seg id="88"> - Sometimes I was risking. - But where...? </seg>
<seg id="89"> - Here. - I can not! </seg>
<seg id="90"> You can. In the casualty there is often a surprise. </seg>
<seg id="91"> "Cara Nagiko"? </seg>
<seg id="92"> Some of the great Japanese calligraphers were very shy men and extreme modesty. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Humble daytime scribes, daring poets at night. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Very well. Now write something else here. Though trepidation, I tried to get away from what I knew best. </seg>
<seg id="95"> After all, there were other great calligraphic traditions. </seg>
<seg id="96"> What did you write? It's up to you to find out. Yeah, but why and why? </seg>
<seg id="97"> Nagiko, certain cultures forbid the images. </seg>
<seg id="98"> While others might have to forbid writing. </seg>
<seg id="99"> I need writing. </seg>
<seg id="100"> Do not ask me why. Pull out your pen and ... </seg>
<seg id="101"> Please write your name here. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Courage. </seg>
<seg id="103"> One night I met an Englishman at CaffÃ¨ Typo, a translator. </seg>
<seg id="104"> He said to speak 4 languages, including Yiddish. </seg>
<seg id="105"> Give you another chance. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Write me on my back. </seg>
<seg id="107"> But ... what do I have to write? </seg>
<seg id="108"> Write ... </seg>
<seg id="109"> "We met at CaffÃ¨ Typo." </seg>
<seg id="110"> I write it in 3 languages. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Japanese, French and another one of your choice. </seg>
<seg id="112"> Waitress! </seg>
<seg id="113"> Do you want me to write again? </seg>
<seg id="114"> It can be. </seg>
<seg id="115"> I can not understand your smell. Use a scent. And then your fingers ... What's wrong with my fingers? </seg>
<seg id="116"> I'll give you another chance. The last. </seg>
<seg id="117"> Write me on my breast. Well, I do not know if it's the case ... </seg>
<seg id="118"> What? I decide whether it is the case or not! </seg>
<seg id="119"> Write in yiddish! How do you say breast in yiddish? </seg>
<seg id="120"> If you are a writer, you can write anywhere. </seg>
<seg id="121"> It is not a great performance. </seg>
<seg id="122"> You are not a writer. </seg>
<seg id="123"> This is not writing, it is scribbling. </seg>
<seg id="124"> It's just a scribble. </seg>
<seg id="125"> Get out! </seg>
<seg id="126"> You are not a writer. You're a scribble! </seg>
<seg id="127"> I've watched you with your small typewriter by clicking-clac. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Get out! Get lost! </seg>
<seg id="129"> Teach me. </seg>
<seg id="130"> - Power. - No! Seriously? </seg>
<seg id="131"> What pleasure can I make writing about you? </seg>
<seg id="132"> - You have to write about me! - Forward. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Use my body as the pages of a book. </seg>
<seg id="134"> Of your book. </seg>
<seg id="135"> An instrument of writing nothing at all extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id="136"> I started thinking about experimental processing </seg>
<seg id="137"> of the Six Shonagon Anatomical Comparison List. </seg>
<seg id="138"> The ideas were often her but the words were just mine. </seg>
<seg id="139"> For my first writing experiment on the flesh, I made an agreement with an Englishman for whom even the simplest ideogram was a sign of no sense. </seg>
<seg id="140"> Hockey, if you care about my interests, it's time to prove it to me. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Come now. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Up, get to work and do your best. But I will not pay you, you're still in debt. </seg>
<seg id="143"> From now on I will write. </seg>
<seg id="144"> From now on the pen will be the pen and not the simple card. </seg>
<seg id="145"> I could be useful to you. </seg>
<seg id="146"> I do not think so. </seg>
<seg id="147"> Why? What am I supposed to do? </seg>
<seg id="148"> Because you're in Kyoto and you're young. </seg>
<seg id="149"> And you have an illegible writing. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Also your skin as a card is not worth much. </seg>
<seg id="151"> He's gonna see. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Did you see? Do you know how I nicknamed you in my diary? </seg>
<seg id="153"> Sponge skin. </seg>
<seg id="154"> But I could help you. </seg>
<seg id="155"> I do not think it's appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="157"> You're not very clever in complimenting. </seg>
<seg id="158"> Let me try. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Come on, let me try. </seg>
<seg id="160"> Hoki will go out at dawn to go to Kowloon City on a busy street where they will deliver the pack to a salesman. </seg>
<seg id="161"> "We do not think the conditions for publishing your material exist, and it is not worth the paper on which it is written." </seg>
<seg id="162"> They also despise the quality of the paper. </seg>
<seg id="163"> Maybe it's not quite Japanese. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Use me, try to write to me. </seg>
<seg id="165"> Seduction of a man ... </seg>
<seg id="166"> I met Jerome at CaffÃ¨ Typo and asked him for his performance as a translator. </seg>
<seg id="167"> I will offer you the choice between 6 languages. </seg>
<seg id="168"> She had learned two more. </seg>
<seg id="169"> I talked to him for a long time, worshiping him. </seg>
<seg id="170"> Showing admiration for all the books he still had to write. </seg>
<seg id="171"> You have to sign here. </seg>
<seg id="172"> Our first report was strictly financial. </seg>
<seg id="173"> He wanted to pay the bill but did not have any money. </seg>
<seg id="174"> He offered to sign a check but he did not have the booklet. </seg>
<seg id="175"> I offered him the palm of my hand. </seg>
<seg id="176"> I could not seduce the publisher. But maybe I could seduce her lover. </seg>
<seg id="177"> His writing in so many languages ​​turned me into a living stele pointing to the east, west, north, and south. </seg>
<seg id="178"> I had German shoes, French socks, Jewish gloves, a hat with Russian vests. </seg>
<seg id="179"> The only points I did not write about were those I covered with the garments. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Stay silent, get out! Get lost! </seg>
<seg id="181"> I would like to honor my writer. </seg>
<seg id="182"> I could help you. </seg>
<seg id="183"> I could learn other languages. </seg>
<seg id="184"> So you could read them all over the world. </seg>
<seg id="185"> When God created the first human being, he painted on his eyes, lips and sex. </seg>
<seg id="186"> And when God was pleased with his creation, he was obliged to sign it with his name. </seg>
<seg id="187"> There are so many publishers in the world, because he is? </seg>
<seg id="188"> I have my good reasons. </seg>
<seg id="189"> I suspect it's because it has cleared you so abruptly and a few people, maybe none, never did. </seg>
<seg id="190"> It can be. </seg>
<seg id="191"> If you are so determined to get published by him, a publisher who does not consider you, and who loves me, then I have an idea. </seg>
<seg id="192"> I could make you a messenger. You could write about me. </seg>
<seg id="193"> And with your permission and your blessing, I could ... Go visit your friend publisher. </seg>
<seg id="194"> What an abnegation! </seg>
<seg id="195"> But I'm sure you will not enjoy it, do not you think so? </seg>
<seg id="196"> It can be. </seg>
<seg id="197"> Would you be jealous? </seg>
<seg id="198"> They went and copied everything. He's waiting for me. </seg>
<seg id="199"> He is thinking of an altogether </seg>
<seg id="200"> You'll do them, do not you? </seg>
<seg id="201"> - See you tonight, here in front of you. - Hey! </seg>
<seg id="202"> You are taking too much taste. </seg>
<seg id="203"> But I have your permission. And then it's just editorial needs. </seg>
<seg id="204"> If you do not mind, I'll look for someone else. </seg>
<seg id="205"> Try it. </seg>
<seg id="206"> He dared let me wait. Buy the other card. </seg>
<seg id="207"> Do not get angry. Why do not you use me? </seg>
<seg id="208"> Still two of these and brings something for him too. </seg>
<seg id="209"> She could scare a son! </seg>
<seg id="210"> Nothing wrong, huh? I need human skin. - 2 and a half feet. </seg>
<seg id="211"> - You are welcome? Front and back. </seg>
<seg id="212"> I could give you three and a half! </seg>
<seg id="213"> I believe it. Only my controversial publisher is very demanding regarding the quality of the paper. </seg>
<seg id="214"> Jerome! </seg>
<seg id="215"> Jerome! </seg>
<seg id="216"> Serve me both. Come with me? </seg>
<seg id="217"> Come on, let's go! You're fabulous! </seg>
<seg id="218"> One bet, I swear to God! </seg>
<seg id="219"> Do you know what? </seg>
<seg id="220"> There's a song about you in America, do you know how it's called? </seg>
<seg id="221"> It is called "Ice cream"! </seg>
<seg id="222"> The lady said that I ... </seg>
<seg id="223"> Ready? Pull out one foot, pull the other out! Then make a twist. I'm thirsty so much! But you lick the gelatin, lick the jelly! </seg>
<seg id="224"> - Hi dear. - Nagiko! </seg>
<seg id="225"> Americans always say they have nothing to hide. </seg>
<seg id="226"> And apparently it is true! </seg>
<seg id="227"> What's this stuff? What kind of printed cabbage? </seg>
<seg id="228"> This is a menu! </seg>
<seg id="229"> Nagiko! </seg>
<seg id="230"> I know you're there, let me in! </seg>
<seg id="231"> Do not play, I know you are there! </seg>
<seg id="232"> Nagiko! </seg>
<seg id="233"> I saw your friend. Your friend cries. </seg>
<seg id="234"> She was really cute, pretty cute ... </seg>
<seg id="235"> It was covered by my ink. That ink was for my body. </seg>
<seg id="236"> Nagiko! What have I done? What have I done? </seg>
<seg id="237"> Nagiko, let me in. </seg>
<seg id="238"> I love you, Nagiko! </seg>
<seg id="239"> I love you, speak to me! </seg>
<seg id="240"> Nagiko! </seg>
<seg id="241"> Please! </seg>
<seg id="242"> I'm not playing! </seg>
<seg id="243"> Let me in! Let me in! </seg>
<seg id="244"> Why do not you want to talk to me? </seg>
<seg id="245"> I do not know. </seg>
<seg id="246"> How do you not know? When did you last see it? </seg>
<seg id="247"> Whiskey. </seg>
<seg id="248"> Whiskey. </seg>
<seg id="249"> She comes here just to choose, look for her customers. </seg>
<seg id="250"> She comes here, she turns and chooses. </seg>
<seg id="251"> All the waiters make them ruffian. </seg>
<seg id="252"> They point to customers who have very smooth skin. </seg>
<seg id="253"> Even in the middle of the legs. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Then her waitress washed them long with lemon juice to make their skin soft and smooth. </seg>
<seg id="255"> But you can scare her. </seg>
<seg id="256"> You are a writer. </seg>
<seg id="257"> Do you remember Juliet and Romeo? </seg>
<seg id="258"> Shakespeare. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Jerome! </seg>
<seg id="260"> Jerome, I apologize. </seg>
<seg id="261"> Let's start over as if nothing had happened. </seg>
<seg id="262"> I was furious, you deceived me. </seg>
<seg id="263"> Just with the man I hate, the man who reared my father. </seg>
<seg id="264"> But we can avenge him. </seg>
<seg id="265"> But we have to work. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Jerome! </seg>
<seg id="267"> Jerome! </seg>
<seg id="268"> He had always wanted to be a stranger. Although not necessarily Oriental. </seg>
<seg id="269"> Our culture was tight to him. </seg>
<seg id="270"> But he would never have become a writer. </seg>
<seg id="271"> He did not have enough imagination. </seg>
<seg id="272"> Jerome was dyslexic up to 12 years before the thing became fashionable. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He smashed all the pairs of glasses I was giving him. </seg>
<seg id="274"> She hated wearing glasses. </seg>
<seg id="275"> But it was great to break things up. </seg>
<seg id="276"> Especially the relationships, like her father. </seg>
<seg id="277"> His father was a converted Catholic. Always with the anxiety of experiencing her faith. </seg>
<seg id="278"> The first child we called Paul, the second Jerome by the name of his father's confessor, a Jesuit who lived in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="279"> Jerome never liked me. </seg>
<seg id="280"> She preferred my sister. An insolent wandering guy who was crazy about modern literature, obscenities, blasphemies, and scatology before they became fashionable. </seg>
<seg id="281"> I've heard that she is also fashionable. </seg>
<seg id="282"> I guess it was to excite Jerome. </seg>
<seg id="283"> We burned an echo of Jerome's car but not his books. </seg>
<seg id="284"> They were too moist. </seg>
<seg id="285"> I burned my books, my clothes, shoes, photos, and diaries. </seg>
<seg id="286"> It was the second great fire in my life. </seg>
<seg id="287"> The first had left me from Japan. The second made me come back. </seg>
<seg id="288"> Hoki wrote to me. </seg>
<seg id="289"> Even after Jerome's death he continued to be very jealous. </seg>
<seg id="290"> He had written to inform me about the publisher's sacred act. </seg>
<seg id="291"> I had promised 13 books to Jerome. </seg>
<seg id="292"> Since I could not write it on her body, </seg>
<seg id="293"> I found substitutes in Japan. </seg>
<seg id="294"> I would have written the books for the publisher in return for the return of the intimate diary in which he had transformed Jerome's body. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Now that you've been signed, do it and do what I told you. </seg>
<seg id="296"> Excuse me, can I see the director? </seg>
<seg id="297"> Let's take another picture. </seg>
<seg id="298"> Sorry, from the manager and tell him we are here. </seg>
<seg id="299"> This is what Nagiko Yoshikino writes: </seg>
<seg id="300"> "I know for sure that she has blackmailed, offended, humiliated, raped my father. </seg>
<seg id="301"> I suspect, too, that she is the cause of my husband's ruin. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Now he has committed the greatest crime. </seg>
<seg id="303"> He profaned my lover's body. </seg>
<seg id="304"> Now we both know that she has lived enough. " </seg>
<seg id="305"> Today I'm 28 years old. </seg>
<seg id="306"> It's my birthday and I already have enough experience writing my intimate diary. </seg>
<seg id="307"> Think of Nagiko Kiyohara's "Pillow Book". </seg>
<seg id="308"> Now I can draw up a list of things that speed up the heartbeats. </seg>
