ï»¿1 It was on my fourth birthday... When my aunt was reading sei shonagon...
2
That I saw my father and his publisher together... For the first time.
3
Though I'm certain that any clear understanding of what I had witnessed...
4
Would have to wait until I was much older.
5
On my sixth birthday... At the matsuo tiasha shrine in kyoto,
6
Encouraged by my aunt, I vowed I would keep a diary. A pillow book of my own.
7
I would fill it with all manner of observations, Just like sei shonagon.
8
Perhaps one day, like her, I could fill it with accounts of all my lovers.
9
On the same day as I started to keep my own pillow book,
10
I met my future husband for the first time.
11
I was six. He was ten.
12
We did not exchange a word.
13
He had been handpicked by my father's publisher.
14
Like sei shonagon, my sense of smell was very strong.
15
I enjoyed the smell of paper of all kinds.
16
It reminded me of the scent of skin.
17
My mother had taught me mandarin.
18
When my father painted a japanese greeting... On my face on my birthday, She played her favorite chinese record.
19
It had been popular when my parents had met in shanghai.
20
In remembrance of my father and in memory of sei shonagon, I was determined to take lovers who would remind me...
21
Of the pleasures of calligraphy.
22
I could not be sure which was more important...
23
An indifferent calligrapher who was a good lover...
24
Or an excellent lover who was a poor calligrapher.
25
I became a wife.
26
I married.
27
I acquired a husband.
28
Whichever way you say it, It was bound to end badly.
29
I had a ceremonial wedding in style.
30
Separated from my parents and my aunt,
31
I confided in my own pillow book more and more frequently.
32
Like the pillow book of sei shonagon, it was full of lists.
33
Unlike sei shonagon, all the lists were negative.
34
That was the first fire.
35
There was to be a second.
36
Both fires marked a big change in my life.
37
When I first arrived in hong kong, I hid.
38
I lived in kowloon city in the cheapest rooming houses I could find.
39
I did not want to be found by my parents. Or by my husband.
40
I tried hard to improve the chinese my mother had taught me.
41
In the meantime, I was determined... To keep alive my father's tradition.
42
I learned to type on my 21st birthday,
43
I tried to give myself my father's blessing.
44
I found work in the offices of a japanese designer.
45
And I was determined to speak english with an american accent.
46
I was planning to go to California.
47
Twenty meter of pale green organdy, pattern 14.
48
A meter of type-b tulle.
49
The small net size.
50
The type-b tulle with the small net size.
51
We went to kyoto, back to japan, To work in the matuso tiasha shrine, Which sei shonagon had visited regularly.
52
I couldn't give up such an opportunity.
53
I was also a little homesick.
54
We didn't finish walking the catwalk until midnight... When all the audience had gone.
55
Sei shonagon had watched the moon rise in that garden... A thousand years ago.
56
I could have walked up and down that path all night long.
57
You are not in a position to preach clean living.
58
Oh, yes, I am. And in blood red.
59
You could join us.
60
I'm too beautiful... And too rich.
61
- What's wealth got to do with it? - A great deal, I'd think.
62
I design material. You can wear it.
63
Frighten the buyers.
64
Then I'd soon cease to be wealthy.
65
You wouldn't need to be paid. You would do it for free. Oh, yeah? What else would you do for free?
66
I've been waiting to waste my talent on your body...
67
For a little reward.
68
My search for the ideal lover-calligrapher continued.
69
But it was becoming less and less likely that I would find him.
70
If they were old, they were invariably in no position... To take advantage of what I had to offer.
71
And if they were young, they were often easily distracted.
72
It's them!
73
Don't look! Don't look.
74
What are you doing here? Are you responsible for this?
75
You shrimp! What do you think you're doing? Shut up!
76
They were children playing a game.
77
They used hoki, the japanese photographer from tokyo, As a pawn to find me.
78
I want those photos.
79
I had once kissed him on the cheek in a moment of happiness.
80
- You're a creep. - I'm sorry. I have watched you, followed you everywhere.
81
It's only too obvious. And I could help you. You haven't done too well so far.
82
You are very beautiful.
83
I employed a calligrapher... With an obsession for mathematics.
84
While his wife sang and waited in the kitchen, This account clerk filled my back with additions, My front with subtractions.
85
I contacted a magazine designer...
86
Who insisted that I came back to his apartment in the new territories, Where he could show me off to his parents who wanted grandchildren.
87
- Write "dear nagiko." - What?
88
- I took risks. - Where?
89
- Here. - I can't.
90
- Yes, you can. - Who knows what casual meeting would produce a surprise.
91
Nagiko?
92
Some of the great japanese calligraphers... Were very modest and unassuming men.
93
Humble clerks by day, daring poets by night.
94
Good. Now write something else here. With great trepidation, I sought to move away from what I knew best.
95
After all, there were other great calligraphic traditions.
96
What have you written? That's for you to find out. How am I going to do that?
97
You know, some cultures permit no images.
98
Perhaps some cultures ought to permit no visible text.
99
I need writing.
100
Don't ask me why. Just take out your pen and,
101
Please, write your name on my arm.
102
Go on.
103
I met an english translator at the cafe typo.
104
He said he spoke four languages, including yiddish.
105
I'll give you another chance.
106
Write on my back.
107
Well, what shall I write?
108
Write...
109
"we met for the first time at the cafe typo."
110
Write in three languages...
111
Japanese, french and english.
112
Waitress!
113
Are we going to do more writing?
114
Perhaps.
115
You smell strange. Do you use perfume? And your fingers. What's wrong with my fingers?
116
I'll give you another chance. The last one.
117
Write on my breasts. A little inappropriate.
118
I'll decide what's inappropriate.
119
Write in yiddish. What's yiddish for "breasts"?
120
If you're a writer, surely you'd write on anything?
121
This is not going to work.
122
You're not a writer.
123
This is not writing; It's scribbling.
124
Distasteful scribbling.
125
Get out.
126
You're not a writer; You're a scribbler.
127
I've watched you with your little typewriter go click, click, clack.
128
Get out. Go!
129
You could show me.
130
- Go on. - No. I can't.
131
How can I get pleasure writing on you?
132
You have to write on me. Go on.
133
Use my body like the pages of a book.
134
Of your book.
135
Not a special writing instrument at all.
136
I began very tentatively,
137
Thinking of sei shonagon's lists of anatomical comparisons.
138
The thoughts were often hers, But the words were entirely mine.
139
For my first experiment in using flesh as paper, I made a deal with an englishman who was entirely ignorant of oriental languages.
140
Hoki, this is where you can prove you have my interests at heart.
141
Come here quickly.
142
Off you go. Beautiful photographs. And you don't get paid because you owe me.
143
This is where I begin to do the writing.
144
I'm now going to be the pen, not just the paper.
145
I could help you.
146
I think not.
147
Why not? What's wrong with me?
148
Because you are from kyoto, and you're young.
149
And your handwriting is illegible.
150
Besides, your skin does not make a good paper.
151
Watch.
152
You see? In my diary, I called you "the blotter."
153
Hoki the blotter.
154
I could help you.
155
I think not.
156
Why not?
157
You're none too smart with compliments.
158
Let me try.
159
Let me try.
160
Hoki set off at dawn for a foreign language bookshop... In kowloon city in a street full of restaurants. He finally gave the packet to some doorman.
161
"We feel that we are unable to consider... "publication of this material. It's not worth the paper it's written on."
162
So they're not satisfied with the quality of the paper.
163
Perhaps it's not japanese enough.
164
Try writing on me.
165
Seduce him.
166
I met jerome in the cafe typo... And asked him for the services of a translator.
167
He gave me a choice of six languages.
168
They had increased by two.
169
I talked to him and I flattered him,
170
And I admired all the books he had yet to write.
171
You have to sign here.
172
Our first transaction was strictly financial.
173
He wanted to pay the bill but had no money.
174
He offered to write a check but had no checkbook.
175
I volunteered the palm of my hand.
176
If I could not seduce the publisher, Then perhaps I could seduce the publisher's lover.
177
His writing, in so many languages, Made me a signpost pointing east, west, north and south.
178
I had shoes in german, stockings in french, Gloves in hebrew, a hat with a veil in italian.
179
He only kept me naked where I was most accustomed to wear clothes.
180
Shut up. Go away. Go away.
181
I would like to honor my father by becoming a writer.
182
I could help.
183
I could learn new languages...
184
To make you understood... All over the world.
185
When god made his first human being... He painted in the eyes. And lips. And the sex.
186
And when god approved of his creation... He was obliged to sign his name.
187
There are so many publishers in the world. Why worry about this one?
188
I have my reasons.
189
I suspect it's because he rejected you so swiftly, And few people, if any, have ever done that.
190
Perhaps.
191
But... If you're so determined to be published by him, The publisher who rejects you and who loves me... Then I have a plan.
192
I could be your messenger. You could write on me.
193
And with your permission and, of course, your blessing, I could... Pay your publishing friend a visit?
194
A sacrifice?
195
But not without pleasure for you?
196
Perhaps.
197
You could be jealous?
198
It's worked. He won't let me go. Wait for me.
199
He's thinking of an edition of 3,000...
200
If there are more, and there will be more, won't there?
201
I'll see you this evening. Wait for me here.
202
Hey, you are enjoying it too much.
203
But with your permission. And only according to the quality of the writing.
204
If you don't hurry it along, I'll be looking for someone else.
205
You dare.
206
He's making me wait. Buy some new paper.
207
Don't get so upset. You could use me.
208
Give me two more of these and some more of this and some stuff for him.
209
You could have babies.
210
- They're not bad-looking ladies. - I need some skin, two meters and a half.
211
- Sorry? - Back and front.
212
I could give you three and a half.
213
True, but the quality of the paper would not attract my fastidious publisher.
214
Jerome!
215
Jerome!
216
I need you both. Come with me?
217
I really do. It's like wild kingdom.
218
All right, you're gonna like this one. This one's funny.
219
Hey, you know something?
220
They got a song about you in america. You know what it's called?
221
It's called "the hokeypokey."
222
You get it? "The hokeypokey."
223
Ready? You put your right foot in you put your right foot out your put your right foot in and you shake it all about you do the hokeypokey. You turn your...
224
Hello. Sorry.
225
Americans always say they have nothing to hide.
226
I can see that's true.
227
Look what I got here?
228
It is a menu.
229
Nagiko!
230
I know you're there! Let me in!
231
Don't play games! I know you're there!
232
Nagiko!
233
I met your friend. I met your fat friend.
234
He was nice? Was he nice?
235
He was covered in my paint! My paint for my body!
236
Oh, my god! What have I done? What have I done?
237
Please let me in!
238
I love you, nagiko.
239
I love you. Talk to me.
240
Nagiko!
241
Please!
242
I won't play games.
243
Let me in! Let me in!
244
Why won't she talk to me?
245
I don't know.
246
What do you mean, you don't know? Have you seen her? When did you last see her?
247
Whiskey.
248
Whiskey.
249
She comes here, you know, to pick up her clients.
250
She almost lives here.
251
The waiters are all pimps.
252
She makes sure they are very smooth-skinned.
253
You know? Between the legs?
254
Her maid usually washes them... With lemon juice to make their skin soft... And smooth.
255
But you could scare her.
256
You are a writer,
257
Like in romeo and juliet.
258
Shakespeare?
259
Jerome!
260
Jerome, I'm sorry.
261
We can start again from where we left off.
262
I was angry. You deceived me...
263
With a man I detest, with a man who blackmailed my father.
264
But... We can revenge him.
265
We need to work.
266
Jerome!
267
Jerome!
268
Jerome always wanted to be foreign, Though not necessarily oriental.
269
English wasn't enough for him.
270
He'd never have made a writer.
271
He didn't have enough imagination.
272
Jerome was dyslexic until he was 12, Before it became fashionable.
273
And he broke every pair of glasses I gave him.
274
He hated wearing glasses.
275
He was very good at breaking things,
276
Especially relationships, just like his father.
277
His father was a catholic convert, always experimenting with faith.
278
We called our first son paul and our second jerome... After his father's confessor, who was a jesuit in singapore.
279
Jerome never liked me.
280
He preferred my sister, A little fool who was excited by modern literature. All swear words and scatology, before it became fashionable.
281
I hear you're fashionable.
282
I suppose that's what excited jerome.
283
We burned an effigy of jerome's car. We didn't burn his books.
284
They were too damp.
285
I burned my books... And my clothes and shoes... And the photographs and diaries.
286
It was the second major fire in my life.
287
The first fire had taken me out of japan. The second took me back.
288
Hoki wrote to me.
289
Even after jerome's death, he was still very, very jealous.
290
He wrote to tell me about the publisher's act of sacrilege.
291
I had promised jerome 13 books.
292
I could not now write them on jerome's body.
293
I found substitutes in japan.
294
I would write the books for the publisher as a bargain... For the return of the pillow book he had made of jerome's body.
295
Now you've been signed by me, You can go and do my business.
296
Excuse me. Can I see the manager, please?
297
Let's take another photograph.
298
Excuse me. Give it to the manager and tell him we are here.
299
This is the writing of Nagiko Yujikino,
300
And I know you to have blackmailed, Violated and humiliated my father.
301
I suspect you also of ruining my husband.
302
You have now committed the greatest crime.
303
You have desecrated the body of my lover.
304
You and I now know... That you have lived long enough.
305
Today, I am 28 years old.
306
And on my 28th birthday I have experiences enough... To write my own pillow book.
307
Think of that. The pillow book of Nagiko Kiyohara.
308
I can now make my own list of things... That make the heart beat faster.
309
310
311
