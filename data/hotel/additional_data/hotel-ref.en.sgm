<seg id="1"> It is an extremely common mistake, </seg>
<seg id="2"> people think the writer's imagination is always at work, </seg>
<seg id="3"> that he's constantly inventing an endless supply </seg>
<seg id="4"> of incidents and episodes, </seg>
<seg id="5"> that he simply dreams up his stories out of thin air. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In point of fact, the opposite is true. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Once the public knows you're a writer, </seg>
<seg id="8"> they bring the characters and events to you </seg>
<seg id="9"> and as long as you maintain your ability to look </seg>
<seg id="10"> and to carefully listen, </seg>
<seg id="11"> these stories will continue to... </seg>
<seg id="12"> Stop it. Stop it! Don't! Don't do it! </seg>
<seg id="13"> Uh, will continue to seek you out over your lifetime. </seg>
<seg id="14"> To him who has often told the tales of others, </seg>
<seg id="15"> many tales will be told. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Sorry. It's all right. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The incidents that follow were described to me </seg>
<seg id="18"> exactly as I present them here </seg>
<seg id="19"> and in a wholly unexpected way. </seg>
<seg id="20"> <i>A number of years ago,</i> </seg>
<seg id="21"> <i>while suffering from a mild case of "Scribe's Fever,"</i> </seg>
<seg id="22"> a <i>form of neurasthenia common among</i> </seg>
<seg id="23"> <i>the intelligentsia of that time,</i> </seg>
<seg id="24"> <i>I decided to spend the month of August</i> </seg>
<seg id="25"> <i>in the spa town of Nebelsbad below the Alpine Sudetenwaltz,</i> </seg>
<seg id="26"> <i>and had taken up rooms in the Grand Budapest,</i> </seg>
<seg id="27"> <i>a picturesque, elaborate, and once widely celebrated establishment.</i> </seg>
<seg id="28"> <i>I expect some of you will know it.</i> </seg>
<seg id="29"> <i>YOUNG</i> WRITER: <i>It was off season and, by that time, decidedly out of fashion,</i> </seg>
<seg id="30"> <i>and it had already begun its descent</i> </seg>
<seg id="31"> <i>into shabbiness and eventual demolition.</i> </seg>
<seg id="32"> <i>What few guests we were</i> </seg>
<seg id="33"> <i>had quickly come to recognize one another by sight</i> </seg>
<seg id="34"> <i>as the only living souls residing in the vast establishment,</i> </seg>
<seg id="35"> <i>although I do not believe any acquaintance among our number had proceeded</i> </seg>
<seg id="36"> <i>beyond the polite nods we exchanged as we passed</i> </seg>
<seg id="37"> <i>in the Palm Court,</i> </seg>
<seg id="38"> <i>in the Arabian baths,</i> </seg>
<seg id="39"> <i>and on board the Colonnade Funicular.</i> </seg>
<seg id="40"> We were a very reserved group, <i>it</i> seemed, </seg>
<seg id="41"> <i>and, without exception, solitary.</i> </seg>
<seg id="42"> <i>Perhaps as a result of this general silence,</i> </seg>
<seg id="43"> <i>I had established a casual and bantering familiarity</i> </seg>
<seg id="44"> <i>with the hotel's concierge, a West-continental</i> </seg>
<seg id="45"> <i>known only as Monsieur Jean,</i> </seg>
<seg id="46"> <i>who struck one as being, at once,</i> </seg>
<seg id="47"> <i>both lazy and, really, quite accommodating.</i> </seg>
<seg id="48"> <i>I expect he was not well paid.</i> </seg>
<seg id="49"> In any case, one evening, </seg>
<seg id="50"> <i>as I stood conferring elbow-to-elbow with Monsieur Jean,</i> </seg>
<seg id="51"> <i>as had become my habit, I noticed a new presence in our company.</i> </seg>
<seg id="52"> <i>A small, elderly man, smartly dressed,</i> </seg>
<seg id="53"> <i>with an exceptionally lively, intelligent face</i> </seg>
<seg id="54"> <i>and an immediately perceptible air of sadness.</i> </seg>
<seg id="55"> <i>He was, like the rest of us, alone, but also, I must say,</i> </seg>
<seg id="56"> <i>he was the first that struck one as being deeply and truly lonely.</i> </seg>
<seg id="57"> <i>A symptom of my own medical condition as well.</i> </seg>
<seg id="58"> Who's this interesting old fellow? </seg>
<seg id="59"> <i>I inquired of Monsieur Jean.</i> </seg>
<seg id="60"> <i>To my surprise, he was distinctly taken aback.</i> </seg>
<seg id="61"> Don't you know? He <i>asked.</i> </seg>
<seg id="62"> Don't you recognize him? </seg>
<seg id="63"> <i>He did look familiar.</i> </seg>
<seg id="64"> That's Mr. Moustafa himself. </seg>
<seg id="65"> He arrived earlier this morning. </seg>
<seg id="66"> <i>This name will no doubt be familiar</i> </seg>
<seg id="67"> <i>to the more seasoned persons among you.</i> </seg>
<seg id="68"> <i>Mr. Zero Moustafa was at one time the richest man in Zubrowka,</i> </seg>
<seg id="69"> <i>and was still indeed the owner of the Grand Budapest.</i> </seg>
<seg id="70"> He often comes and stays a week or more, </seg>
<seg id="71"> three times a year at least, but never in the season. </seg>
<seg id="72"> <i>Monsieur Jean signaled to me and I leaned closer.</i> </seg>
<seg id="73"> I'll tell you a secret. </seg>
<seg id="74"> He takes only a single-bed sleeping room without a bath </seg>
<seg id="75"> in the rear corner of the top floor </seg>
<seg id="76"> and it's smaller than the service elevator! </seg>
<seg id="77"> <i>It was well known,</i> </seg>
<seg id="78"> <i>Zero Moustafa had purchased and famously inhabited</i> </seg>
<seg id="79"> <i>some of the most lavish castles and palazzos on the continent.</i> </seg>
<seg id="80"> <i>Yet here, in his own nearly empty hotel,</i> </seg>
<seg id="81"> <i>he occupied a servant's quarters?</i> </seg>
<seg id="82"> <i>At that moment, the curtain rose</i> </seg>
<seg id="83"> <i>on a parenthetical, domestic drama...</i> </seg>
<seg id="84"> Shit. </seg>
<seg id="85"> <i>...which required the immediate and complete attention</i> </seg>
<seg id="86"> of Monsieur Jean, </seg>
<seg id="87"> <i>but, frankly, did not hold mine for long.</i> </seg>
<seg id="88"> However, </seg>
<seg id="89"> <i>this premature intermission in the story of the curious, old man</i> </seg>
<seg id="90"> <i>had left me, as the expression goes,</i> </seg>
<seg id="91"> "gespannt wie ein Flitzebogen," </seg>
<seg id="92"> <i>that is, on the edge of my seat,</i> </seg>
<seg id="93"> <i>where I remained throughout the next morning, until,</i> </seg>
<seg id="94"> <i>in what I have found to be its mysterious and utterly reliable fashion,</i> </seg>
<seg id="95"> <i>fate, once again, intervened on my behalf.</i> </seg>
<seg id="96"> MR. MOUSTAFA: I admire your work. </seg>
<seg id="97"> I beg your pardon? </seg>
<seg id="98"> I said, I know and admire your wonderful work. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Thank you most kindly, sir. </seg>
<seg id="100"> Did Monsieur Jean have a word or two to share with you </seg>
<seg id="101"> about the aged proprietor of this establishment? </seg>
<seg id="102"> I must confess, I did myself inquire about you. </seg>
<seg id="103"> He's perfectly capable, of course, Monsieur Jean </seg>
<seg id="104"> but we can't claim he's a first, </seg>
<seg id="105"> or, in earnest, even second-rate concierge. </seg>
<seg id="106"> But there it is. </seg>
<seg id="107"> Times have changed. </seg>
<seg id="108"> The thermal baths are very beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="109"> They were in their first condition. </seg>
<seg id="110"> It couldn't be maintained, of course. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Too decadent for current tastes. </seg>
<seg id="112"> But I love it all just the same, this enchanting old ruin. </seg>
<seg id="113"> How did you come to buy it, if I may ask? </seg>
<seg id="114"> The Grand Budapest. </seg>
<seg id="115"> I didn't. </seg>
<seg id="116"> If you're not merely being polite, </seg>
<seg id="117"> and you must tell me if that's the case, </seg>
<seg id="118"> but if it genuinely does interest you, </seg>
<seg id="119"> may I invite you to dine with me tonight, </seg>
<seg id="120"> and it will be my pleasure and, indeed, my privilege to tell you </seg>
<seg id="121"> "my story." Such as it is. </seg>
<seg id="122"> Two ducks roasted with olives. </seg>
<seg id="123"> Rabbit, salad? Mmm. </seg>
<seg id="124"> Pouilly-Jouvet '52, plus a split of the brut. </seg>
<seg id="125"> That should provide us ample time </seg>
<seg id="126"> if I commence promptly. </seg>
<seg id="127"> By all means. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Well, it begins, as it must, with our mutual friend's predecessor. </seg>
<seg id="129"> The beloved, original concierge of The Grand Budapest. </seg>
<seg id="130"> It begins, of course, with... </seg>
<seg id="131"> Bring the table to the window. Yes, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="132"> Bring the tray to the table. Right away, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Right there. Have those been brushed and blocked? </seg>
<seg id="134"> Of course, Monsieur Gustave. Pack them in the hat boxes. </seg>
<seg id="135"> Is that from Oberstdorf & Company? </seg>
<seg id="136"> I believe so, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="137"> Second trunk. Who has the tickets? I do, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="138"> Give them to me. </seg>
<seg id="139"> These are in order. Wait in the corner. </seg>
<seg id="140"> I'm not leaving. </seg>
<seg id="141"> I beg your pardon? </seg>
<seg id="142"> I'm not leaving. Why not? </seg>
<seg id="143"> I'm frightened. Of what? </seg>
<seg id="144"> I fear this may be the last time we ever see each other. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Why on earth would that be the case? </seg>
<seg id="146"> Well, I can't put it into words, but I feel it. </seg>
<seg id="147"> For goodness sake, there's no reason </seg>
<seg id="148"> for you to leave us if you'd... </seg>
<seg id="149"> Come with me. </seg>
<seg id="150"> To fucking Lutz? </seg>
<seg id="151"> Please. Give me your hand. </seg>
<seg id="152"> You've nothing to fear. You're always anxious before you travel. </seg>
<seg id="153"> I admit, you appear to be suffering </seg>
<seg id="154"> a more acute attack on this occasion. </seg>
<seg id="155"> But, truly and honestly... Oh, dear God. </seg>
<seg id="156"> What have you done to your fingernails? </seg>
<seg id="157"> I beg your pardon? This diabolical varnish. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The color is completely wrong. Don't you like it? </seg>
<seg id="159"> It's not that I don't like it. I am physically repulsed. </seg>
<seg id="160"> Perhaps this will soothe you. </seg>
<seg id="161"> What? Don't recite. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Just listen to the words. Hush. </seg>
<seg id="163"> Please. Not now. </seg>
<seg id="164"> "While questing once in noble wood of gray, medieval pine, </seg>
<seg id="165"> "I came upon a tomb, rain-slick'd, rubbed-cool, ethereal, </seg>
<seg id="166"> "'its inscription long-vanished, </seg>
<seg id="167"> "yet still within its melancholy fissures..." </seg>
<seg id="168"> MADAME D.: Will you light a candle for me, please? </seg>
<seg id="169"> In the sacristy of Santa Maria? </seg>
<seg id="170"> GUSTAVE H: I'll see to it myself immediately. </seg>
<seg id="171"> Remember, I'm always with you. </seg>
<seg id="172"> I love you. </seg>
<seg id="173"> I love you. </seg>
<seg id="174"> It's quite a thing winning the loyalty of a woman like that </seg>
<seg id="175"> for 19 consecutive seasons. </seg>
<seg id="176"> Um... Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="177"> She's very fond of me, you know. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="179"> But I've never seen her like that before. </seg>
<seg id="180"> No, sir. </seg>
<seg id="181"> She was shaking like a shitting dog. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Truly. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Run to the cathedral of Santa Maria in Brucknerplatz. </seg>
<seg id="184"> Buy one of the plain, half-length candles </seg>
<seg id="185"> and take back four Klubecks in change. </seg>
<seg id="186"> Light it in the sacristy, say a brief rosary </seg>
<seg id="187"> then go to Mendl's and get me a courtesan au chocolat. </seg>
<seg id="188"> If there's any money left, give it to the crippled shoe-shine boy. </seg>
<seg id="189"> Right away, sir. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Hold it. </seg>
<seg id="191"> Who are you? </seg>
<seg id="192"> I'm Zero, sir. The new Lobby Boy. </seg>
<seg id="193"> Zero, you say? Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="194"> I've never heard of you, never laid eyes on you. </seg>
<seg id="195"> Who hired you? </seg>
<seg id="196"> Mr. Mosher, sir. </seg>
<seg id="197"> Mr. Mosher! </seg>
<seg id="198"> Yes, Monsieur Gustave? </seg>
<seg id="199"> Am I to understand you've surreptitiously hired this young man </seg>
<seg id="200"> in the position of a Lobby Boy? </seg>
<seg id="201"> He's been engaged for a trial period, </seg>
<seg id="202"> pending your approval, of course. </seg>
<seg id="203"> Uh... </seg>
<seg id="204"> Perhaps, yes. Thank you, Mr. Mosher. </seg>
<seg id="205"> You're most welcome, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="206"> You're now going to be officially interviewed. </seg>
<seg id="207"> Should I go and light the candle first, sir? </seg>
<seg id="208"> What? No. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Experience? </seg>
<seg id="210"> Hotel Kinski, Kitchen Boy, six months. </seg>
<seg id="211"> Hotel Berlitz, Mop and Broom Boy, three months. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Before that I was a Skillet Scrubber... </seg>
<seg id="213"> Experience, zero. </seg>
<seg id="214"> Thank you again, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="215"> Straighten that cap, Anatole. </seg>
<seg id="216"> The pleasure's mine, <i>Herr</i> Schneider. The strap's busted. </seg>
<seg id="217"> These are not acceptable. I fully agree. </seg>
<seg id="218"> Education? </seg>
<seg id="219"> I studied reading and spelling. </seg>
<seg id="220"> I started my primary school. I almost... </seg>
<seg id="221"> Education, zero. </seg>
<seg id="222"> Now it's exploded. </seg>
<seg id="223"> Good morning, Cicero. Call the goddamn plumber! </seg>
<seg id="224"> This afternoon, Monsieur Gustave? </seg>
<seg id="225"> Without fail, Frau Liebling. </seg>
<seg id="226"> What in hell is this? Not now. </seg>
<seg id="227"> Family? </seg>
<seg id="228"> Zero. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Six, Igor. </seg>
<seg id="230"> Why do you want to be a Lobby Boy? </seg>
<seg id="231"> Well, who wouldn't, at the Grand Budapest, sir? </seg>
<seg id="232"> It's an institution. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Very good. </seg>
<seg id="234"> A thousand Klubecks. </seg>
<seg id="235"> My goodness. </seg>
<seg id="236"> Were you ever a Lobby Boy, sir? </seg>
<seg id="237"> What do you think? </seg>
<seg id="238"> Well, I suppose you'd have to start somewhere... </seg>
<seg id="239"> Go and light the goddamn candle. Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="240"> <i>MR. MOUSTAFA: And so, my life began.</i> </seg>
<seg id="241"> <i>Junior Lobby Boy in-training,</i> </seg>
<seg id="242"> <i>Grand Budapest Hotel,</i> </seg>
<seg id="243"> <i>under the strict command of Monsieur Gustave H.</i> </seg>
<seg id="244"> <i>I became his pupil, and he was to be my counselor and guardian.</i> </seg>
<seg id="245"> <i>GUSTAVE H: What is</i> a <i>Lobby Boy?</i> </seg>
<seg id="246"> <i>A Lobby Boy's completely invisible, yet always in sight.</i> </seg>
<seg id="247"> <i>A Lobby Boy remembers what people hate.</i> </seg>
<seg id="248"> <i>A Lobby Boy anticipates the client's needs</i> </seg>
<seg id="249"> <i>before the needs are needed.</i> </seg>
<seg id="250"> <i>A Lobby Boy is, above all, discreet to a fault.</i> </seg>
<seg id="251"> Our guests know their deepest secrets, </seg>
<seg id="252"> some of which are, frankly, rather unseemly, </seg>
<seg id="253"> will go with us to our graves. </seg>
<seg id="254"> So keep your mouth shut, Zero. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="256"> That's all for now. </seg>
<seg id="257"> <i>MR. MOUSTAFA: I began to realize that many of the hotel's</i> </seg>
<seg id="258"> <i>most valued and distinguished guests came for him.</i> </seg>
<seg id="259"> <i>It seemed to be an essential part of his duties...</i> </seg>
<seg id="260"> Ah! </seg>
<seg id="261"> <i>...but I believe it was also his pleasure.</i> </seg>
<seg id="262"> <i>The requirements were always the same.</i> </seg>
<seg id="263"> <i>They had to be rich,</i> </seg>
<seg id="264"> <i>old,</i> </seg>
<seg id="265"> insecure, </seg>
<seg id="266"> <i>vain,</i> </seg>
<seg id="267"> <i>superficial,</i> </seg>
<seg id="268"> <i>blonde,</i> </seg>
<seg id="269"> needy. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Why blonde? </seg>
<seg id="271"> Because they all were. </seg>
<seg id="272"> <i>He was, by the way,</i> </seg>
<seg id="273"> <i>the most liberally perfumed man I had ever encountered.</i> </seg>
<seg id="274"> <i>The scent announced his approach from a great distance</i> </seg>
<seg id="275"> <i>and lingered for many minutes after he was gone.</i> </seg>
<seg id="276"> <i>I worked six days each week plus a half-day Sunday,</i> </seg>
<seg id="277"> <i>5:00 AM until just after midnight.</i> </seg>
<seg id="278"> <i>Our meals were small but frequent, for stamina.</i> </seg>
<seg id="279"> <i>Two breakfasts, two lunches and a late supper.</i> </seg>
<seg id="280"> <i>Monsieur Gustave also delivered</i> a <i>nightly sermon.</i> </seg>
<seg id="281"> Rudeness is merely the expression of fear. </seg>
<seg id="282"> People fear they won't get what they want. </seg>
<seg id="283"> The most dreadful and unattractive person only needs to be loved, </seg>
<seg id="284"> and they will open up like a flower. </seg>
<seg id="285"> I am reminded of a verse, </seg>
<seg id="286"> "The painter's brush touched the inchoate face </seg>
<seg id="287"> "by ends of nimble bristles </seg>
<seg id="288"> "and with their blush of first color, </seg>
<seg id="289"> "rendered her lifeless cheek living." </seg>
<seg id="290"> <i>MR. MOUSTAFA: His own dinner, he took alone in his room.</i> </seg>
<seg id="291"> <i>The identity of the owner of the hotel was unknown to all of us.</i> </seg>
<seg id="292"> <i>Each month, his emissary, known as Deputy Kovacs, arrived</i> </seg>
<seg id="293"> <i>to review the books and convey messages</i> </seg>
<seg id="294"> <i>on behalf of the mysterious proprietor.</i> </seg>
<seg id="295"> <i>On these occasions, Monsieur Gustave and our business manager,</i> </seg>
<seg id="296"> <i>Herr Becker, met with him in private consultation above Reception.</i> </seg>
<seg id="297"> <i>This was also when I met Agatha,</i> </seg>
<seg id="298"> <i>but we won't discuss that.</i> </seg>
<seg id="299"> What do you want? Look. </seg>
<seg id="300"> GUSTAVE H: Dear God. </seg>
<seg id="301"> I'm terribly sorry, sir. </seg>
<seg id="302"> We must go to her. </seg>
<seg id="303"> We must? </seg>
<seg id="304"> Tout de suite. She needs me, and I need </seg>
<seg id="305"> you to help me with my bags and so on. </seg>
<seg id="306"> How fast can you pack? Five minutes. </seg>
<seg id="307"> Do it. And bring a bottle of the Pouilly-Jouvet '26 </seg>
<seg id="308"> in an ice bucket with two glasses </seg>
<seg id="309"> so we don't have to drink the cat piss they serve in the dining car. </seg>
<seg id="310"> I blame myself. </seg>
<seg id="311"> She tried to tell me she had a premonition. I didn't listen. </seg>
<seg id="312"> All of Lutz will be dressed in black, </seg>
<seg id="313"> except her own ghastly, deceitful children </seg>
<seg id="314"> whom she loathed and couldn't bear to kiss hello. </seg>
<seg id="315"> They'll be dancing like gypsies. </seg>
<seg id="316"> There's really no point in doing anything in life, </seg>
<seg id="317"> because it's all over in the blink of an eye... </seg>
<seg id="318"> And, the next thing you know, rigor mortis sets in. </seg>
<seg id="319"> Oh, how the good die young. </seg>
<seg id="320"> With any luck, she's left a few Klubecks for your old friend, </seg>
<seg id="321"> but one never knows until the ink </seg>
<seg id="322"> is dry on the death certificate. </seg>
<seg id="323"> She was dynamite in the sack, by the way. </seg>
<seg id="324"> <i>She was 84, Monsieur Gustave.</i> </seg>
<seg id="325"> I've had older. </seg>
<seg id="326"> When you're young, it's all fillet steak, </seg>
<seg id="327"> but as the years go by, you have to move on to the cheaper cuts, </seg>
<seg id="328"> which is fine with me, because I like those. </seg>
<seg id="329"> More flavorful, or so they say. </seg>
<seg id="330"> Why are we stopping at a barley field? </seg>
<seg id="331"> Well, hello there, chaps. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Documents, please. </seg>
<seg id="333"> With pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="334"> It's not a very flattering portrait, I'm afraid. </seg>
<seg id="335"> I was once considered a great beauty. </seg>
<seg id="336"> What does the "F" stand for? Fritz? Franz? </seg>
<seg id="337"> Franz. </seg>
<seg id="338"> I knew it! </seg>
<seg id="339"> He's making a funny face. </seg>
<seg id="340"> That's a Migratory Visa with Stage Three Worker Status, Franz, darling. </seg>
<seg id="341"> He's with me. </seg>
<seg id="342"> Come outside, please. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Now, wait a minute. Sit down, Zero. His papers are in order. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I cross-referenced them myself with </seg>
<seg id="345"> the Bureau of Labor and Servitude. </seg>
<seg id="346"> You can't arrest him simply because he's a bloody immigrant. </seg>
<seg id="347"> He hasn't done anything wrong. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Stop it, damn you! </seg>
<seg id="349"> Never mind, Monsieur Gustave! Let them proceed! </seg>
<seg id="350"> GUSTAVE H: Ow! That hurts! </seg>
<seg id="351"> You filthy, goddamn, pock-marked, fascist assholes! </seg>
<seg id="352"> Take your hands off my Lobby Boy! </seg>
<seg id="353"> What's the problem? </seg>
<seg id="354"> This is outrageous. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The young man works for me at the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad. </seg>

<seg id="862"> GUSTAVE H: I understand. Too risky. We'll just have to wing it, I suppose. </seg>

<seg id="864"> We're wearing them. </seg>
<seg id="865"> No, we're not. </seg>

<seg id="872"> Give me a few squirts of L'air de Panache, please, will you? </seg>
<seg id="873"> Can I not get a squirt, even? </seg>

<seg id="878"> I smell. </seg>
<seg id="879"> That's just marvelous, isn't it? </seg>
<seg id="880"> I suppose this is to be expected back in... </seg>
<seg id="881"> Where do you come from again? </seg>
<seg id="882"> Aq Salim al-Jabat. Precisely. </seg>
<seg id="883"> I suppose this is to be expected back in Aq Salim al-Jabat </seg>

<seg id="901"> Truly. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Well, I suppose I'd better take back everything I just said. </seg>
<seg id="903"> What a bloody idiot I am. Pathetic fool. </seg>
<seg id="904"> Goddamn, selfish bastard. </seg>
<seg id="905"> This is disgraceful, and it's beneath the standards of the Grand Budapest. </seg>
<seg id="906"> I apologize on behalf of the hotel. </seg>
<seg id="907"> It's not your fault. You were just upset I forgot the perfume. </seg>
<seg id="908"> Don't make excuses for me. I owe you my life. </seg>

<seg id="1037"> <i>CLOTILDE: Excusez-moi.</i> </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I believe it was removed by Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> I'm not angry with Serge. </seg>

<seg id="1046"> Yes, I suppose you're right. Of course it depends. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> That doesn't mean I'm not going to throttle the little swamp rat. </seg>

<seg id="1061"> Does she? </seg>
<seg id="1062"> Very much. </seg>
<seg id="1063"> That's a good sign, you know. It means she "gets it." </seg>
