<seg id="1"> Cineteche and Mezzocannone Occupation Thieves present: </seg>
<seg id="2"> The Grand Budapest Hotel </seg>
<seg id="3"> Denatural Tradition </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the eastern border of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The former Republic of Zubrowka </seg>
<seg id="6"> Once home to an Empire. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is a very common mistake, </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is believed that the imagination of a writer is always at work, </seg>
<seg id="9"> Which these invent constantly </seg>
<seg id="10"> Thousands of events, episodes, </seg>
<seg id="11"> That you create your stories from nothing. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In fact, the opposite is true. </seg>
<seg id="13"> When people know you are a writer, </seg>
<seg id="14"> They bring you stories and characters </seg>
<seg id="15"> And as long as you keep your observation skills </seg>
<seg id="16"> And listening attentively, </seg>
<seg id="17"> These stories will continue to ... </seg>
<seg id="18"> Stop it. Stop it! No! Do not do it! </seg>
<seg id="19"> They will continue to find you throughout your life. </seg>
<seg id="20"> To someone who has told other stories, </seg>
<seg id="21"> Many stories will be told. </seg>
<seg id="22"> - Sorry. - It's all OK. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The following events have been described </seg>
<seg id="24"> Exactly as I will present them </seg>
<seg id="25"> And in a totally unexpected way. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Several years ago, </seg>
<seg id="27"> Suffering from a mild form of "writer fever", </seg>
<seg id="28"> A kind of neurastenia common between the intelligence of time, </seg>
<seg id="29"> I decided to spend the month of August </seg>
<seg id="30"> In the spa town of Nebelsbad downstream of the Sudetenwaltz, </seg>
<seg id="31"> And I stayed at Grand Budapest, </seg>
<seg id="32"> A picturesque, elaborate and well celebrated hotel. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Many of you will have heard of it. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It was in the low season and at that time completely out of fashion, </seg>
<seg id="35"> Had already begun its decline </seg>
<seg id="36"> Towards the squalor and the possible demolition. </seg>
<seg id="37"> With the other few guests </seg>
<seg id="38"> We soon came to recognize each other </seg>
<seg id="39"> As the only inhabitants of the vast building, </seg>
<seg id="40"> Even though I do not remember there was any other confidence </seg>
<seg id="41"> Beyond the polite notes of the boss we exchanged encountering </seg>
<seg id="42"> In the palm tree </seg>
<seg id="43"> In the Arab baths </seg>
<seg id="44"> And on board the funicular. </seg>
<seg id="45"> We were a very reserved group, it seemed, </seg>
<seg id="46"> And lonely, without exception. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Perhaps precisely because of this general silence, </seg>
<seg id="48"> I established a cordial familiarity </seg>
<seg id="49"> With the concierge of the hotel, a western one </seg>
<seg id="50"> Known as Monsieur Jean, </seg>
<seg id="51"> Of which laziness was struck but, at the same time, great courtesy. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Suspicion was not at all well paid. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Anyway, one evening, </seg>
<seg id="54"> While, as it became my habit, </seg>
<seg id="55"> I talked to Monsieur Jean, I noticed a new presence in the group. </seg>
<seg id="56"> A minute and old gentleman dressed elegantly, </seg>
<seg id="57"> With an exceptionally intelligent and vibrant face </seg>
<seg id="58"> And a perceiving aura of sadness. </seg>
<seg id="59"> He sat alone, like all of us, but I have to say </seg>
<seg id="60"> Who was the only one who really seemed deeply alone. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Which was also a symptom of my medical condition. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Who is that old gentleman? </seg>
<seg id="63"> I asked Monsieur Jean. </seg>
<seg id="64"> With my astonishment, he was taken aback. </seg>
<seg id="65"> - He does not know? - Churches. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Do not you recognize him? </seg>
<seg id="67"> In fact it seemed familiar to me. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Mr. Moustafa is in person. It came this morning. </seg>
<seg id="69"> This name will undoubtedly be familiar </seg>
<seg id="70"> The most elated among you. </seg>
<seg id="71"> Mr. Zero Moustafa was the richest man in Zubrowka </seg>
<seg id="72"> As well as the owner of Grand Budapest. </seg>
<seg id="73"> He comes often and stays here for a week or more, </seg>
<seg id="74"> Three times a year, never in high season. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Monsieur Jean made me sign and I came closer. </seg>
<seg id="76"> I'll tell you a secret. </seg>
<seg id="77"> It always takes a single room and no bathroom </seg>
<seg id="78"> In a corner of the last floor. </seg>
<seg id="79"> It's smaller than the service lift! </seg>
<seg id="80"> He was well known, </seg>
<seg id="81"> Zero Moustafa had bought and resided </seg>
<seg id="82"> In some of the most sumptuous castles and palaces in the continent. </seg>
<seg id="83"> Yet here, in his half-empty hotel, </seg>
<seg id="84"> Did you have a swimsuit? </seg>
<seg id="85"> At that moment, the curtain opened on a domestic drama ... </seg>
<seg id="86"> Shit. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Which required immediate and total attention </seg>
<seg id="88"> By Monsieur jean, </seg>
<seg id="89"> But who, in sincerity, did not capture mine for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Anyway, </seg>
<seg id="91"> This intrusion in the story of the weird old man </seg>
<seg id="92"> He had left me, as they say, </seg>
<seg id="93"> "Gespannt wie ein Flitzebogen" </seg>
<seg id="94"> Ie on thorns, </seg>
<seg id="95"> And on the thorns I stayed all the following morning, until, </seg>
<seg id="96"> In his usual way of acting mysterious and infallible, </seg>
<seg id="97"> The fate once again moved to my place. </seg>
<seg id="98"> I admire her work. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Excuse me? </seg>
<seg id="100"> I said I know and admire her wonderful work. </seg>
<seg id="101"> Thank you very much, sir. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Monsieur Jean felt he was exchanging a word or two </seg>
<seg id="103"> On the senior owner of this building? </seg>
<seg id="104"> I must confess that she asked her. </seg>
<seg id="105"> Monsieur Jean is absolutely capable, of course, </seg>
<seg id="106"> But one can not say it is a first class concierge, </seg>
<seg id="107"> Neither in honesty, nor second. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But it does. </seg>
<seg id="109"> Times have changed. </seg>
<seg id="110"> The spa baths are really great. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Originally they were. Obviously I could not keep them. </seg>
<seg id="112"> Too decadent for modern taste. </seg>
<seg id="113"> But I love her, too, this lovely old ruin. </seg>
<seg id="114"> How did you buy the Hotel, if I can ask? </seg>
<seg id="115"> The Grand Budapest. </seg>
<seg id="116"> I did not. </seg>
<seg id="117"> If you did not just ask for education, </seg>
<seg id="118"> And please tell me if this is the case, </seg>
<seg id="119"> But if this story interests you seriously, </seg>
<seg id="120"> The invitation to dine with me tonight, </seg>
<seg id="121"> And it will be my pleasure and honor to tell them </seg>
<seg id="122"> "my story". As well as. </seg>
<seg id="123"> Two roasted ducks with olives. </seg>
<seg id="124"> Rabbit, salad? </seg>
<seg id="125"> '52 Poully-Jouvet and a quarter of brut's champagne bottle. </seg>
<seg id="126"> This should give us plenty of time </seg>
<seg id="127"> - if I hesitate to get started. - Of course. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Well, it starts with the predecessor of our common friend. </seg>
<seg id="129"> The beloved first concierge of the Grand Budapest. </seg>
<seg id="130"> Start with ... </seg>
<seg id="131"> - The table near the window. - Yes, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="132"> - The tray on the table. - Right away, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="133"> There. Those were brushed? </seg>
<seg id="134"> - Of course, Monsieur Gustave. - In the hood. </seg>
<seg id="135"> - What about Oberstdorf & Co.? - I think so, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="136"> - In the second trunk. Who has the tickets? - I, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="137"> Give them to me. </seg>
<seg id="138"> I'm in order. Wait in the corner. </seg>
<seg id="139"> - I will not go anymore. - How, excuse me? </seg>
<seg id="140"> - I will not go anymore. - Why not? </seg>
<seg id="141"> - I'm scared. - And what? </seg>
<seg id="142"> I'm afraid this may be the last time we see you. </seg>
<seg id="143"> Why should this be so? </seg>
<seg id="144"> Well, I can not explain it in words, but I feel it. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Divine goodness, there is no reason to leave if you are so ... </seg>
<seg id="146"> - Come with me. - In that lick of Lutz? </seg>
<seg id="147"> - Please. - Give me your hand. </seg>
<seg id="148"> She has nothing to fear. You are always anxious before you leave. </seg>
<seg id="149"> I admit that this time you are more than usual. </seg>
<seg id="150"> But, honestly ... Oh, holy sky. What did you do to your nails? </seg>
<seg id="151"> - How, excuse me? This orbiting enamel. </seg>
<seg id="152"> - Color is completely wrong. - You do not like it? </seg>
<seg id="153"> It's not that I do not like it, it repels me physically. </seg>
<seg id="154"> - Maybe I know what can relax you. - Thing? No, do not play. </seg>
<seg id="155"> - Shh, listen to the words. - Please, not now. </seg>
<seg id="156"> "Ramingo, one night in a noble shroud of cinereas sprinkled pine pines, </seg>
<seg id="157"> I drifted into a frosty tombstones, wet with rain, diaphanous, </seg>
<seg id="158"> The inscription for erosion, </seg>
<seg id="159"> He almost seemed to read in the silent cracks ... " </seg>
<seg id="160"> Would you light up for me? </seg>
<seg id="161"> - In the sacristy of Santa Maria? - I will personally deal with it. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Remember, I'll always be at your side. </seg>
<seg id="163"> - I love you. - I love you. </seg>
<seg id="164"> It is not easy to earn a woman's devotion </seg>
<seg id="165"> For 19 consecutive seasons. </seg>
<seg id="166"> - Yes, sir. - I'm really fond of you, you know. </seg>
<seg id="167"> Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="168"> But I had never seen her so before. </seg>
<seg id="169"> No, sir. </seg>
<seg id="170"> It tumbled like a stitched dog. </seg>
<seg id="171"> Very true. </seg>
<seg id="172"> Drive to the Cathedral of Santa Maria in Brucknerplatz. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Buy a simple, medium length candle </seg>
<seg id="174"> And take 4 Kubeck's rest. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Light it up in the sacristy, he recites a short rosary </seg>
<seg id="176"> Then go to Mendl and take a courtesan au chocolat. </seg>
<seg id="177"> If coins come from you, to the crazed shoeshine kid. </seg>
<seg id="178"> - Right away, sir. - Wait. </seg>
<seg id="179"> - Who are you? - I'm Zero, sir. The new Lobby Boy. </seg>
<seg id="180"> - Zero, did you say that? - Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="181"> I've never seen or heard you call. Who has hired you? </seg>
<seg id="182"> Mr. Mosher, sir. - Mr. Mosher! </seg>
<seg id="183"> Yes, Monsieur Gustave? </seg>
<seg id="184"> It seems to me that you have clandestinely assumed this young man </seg>
<seg id="185"> In the role of Lobby Boy. </seg>
<seg id="186"> He was hired for a trial period, pending his consent. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Maybe yes. Thank you, Mr. Mosher. </seg>
<seg id="188"> It's a pleasure, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="189"> Now you will be officially interviewed. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Do I have to go first to turn that jar, sir? </seg>
<seg id="191"> Thing? No. </seg>
<seg id="192"> Experience? </seg>
<seg id="193"> Hotel Kinski, garzone, six months. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Hotel Berlitz, three months old. </seg>
<seg id="195"> - Before it was still disheveled ... - Experience: zero. </seg>
<seg id="196"> - Thanks again, Monsieur Gustave. - Straighten that cap, Anatole. </seg>
<seg id="197"> "Pleasure is mine, Herr Schneider. - The strap is broken. </seg>
<seg id="198"> - These are unacceptable. - I totally agree. </seg>
<seg id="199"> - Education? - I studied reading and writing. </seg>
<seg id="200"> I started elementary schools. I have almost... </seg>
<seg id="201"> - Education: zero. - This time it exploded. </seg>
<seg id="202"> Good day, Cicero. Call a damned plumber! </seg>
<seg id="203"> - This afternoon, Monsieur Gustave? - Of course, Frau Liebling- </seg>
<seg id="204"> - What the hell is this? - Not now. </seg>
<seg id="205"> Family? </seg>
<seg id="206"> Zero. </seg>
<seg id="207"> Sixth, Igor. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Why do you want to be a Lobby Boy? </seg>
<seg id="209"> Well, who would not want to be at Grand Budapest, sir? </seg>
<seg id="210"> It is an institution. </seg>
<seg id="211"> Very well. </seg>
<seg id="212"> - Mille Klubeck. - My goodness. </seg>
<seg id="213"> Have you ever been a Lobby Boy, sir? </seg>
<seg id="214"> What do you believe? </seg>
<seg id="215"> Well, I guess you should have started somehow ... </seg>
<seg id="216"> - Go to turn on that damned crier. - Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="217"> And so, he started my life. </seg>
<seg id="218"> Aspirant Junior Lobby Boy, </seg>
<seg id="219"> Grand Budapest Hotel, </seg>
<seg id="220"> Under the strict command of Monsieur Gustave H. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Become his pupil, and he was my guardian and supervisor. </seg>
<seg id="222"> What is a Lobby Boy? </seg>
<seg id="223"> A Lobby Boy is completely invisible but always under eye. </seg>
<seg id="224"> A Lobby Boy remembers what customers hate. </seg>
<seg id="225"> A Lobby Boy anticipates the needs of the customer </seg>
<seg id="226"> Even before they need it. </seg>
<seg id="227"> A Lobby Boy is, above all, discreet to the unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="228"> Our guests know that their deeper secrets, </seg>
<seg id="229"> Some of which, frankly, are rather unsuitable, </seg>
<seg id="230"> We will bring them with us into the grave. </seg>
<seg id="231"> - So keep your mouth shut, Zero. - Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="232"> It's all for now. </seg>
<seg id="233"> I began to understand that many of the guests </seg>
<seg id="234"> The most esteemed and distinct hotels of the hotel came for him. </seg>
<seg id="235"> He seemed to be an essential part of his duties, </seg>
<seg id="236"> But I think it was also a pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="237"> The requirements were always the same. </seg>
<seg id="238"> They had to be rich, </seg>
<seg id="239"> decrepit, </seg>
<seg id="240"> insecure, </seg>
<seg id="241"> vain, </seg>
<seg id="242"> superficial, </seg>
<seg id="243"> blondes, </seg>
<seg id="244"> Needing attention. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Why are you blonde? </seg>
<seg id="246"> Because they were all. </seg>
<seg id="247"> It was, moreover, </seg>
<seg id="248"> The most generously fragrant man I ever met. </seg>
<seg id="249"> The fragrance announced its arrival from far away. </seg>
<seg id="250"> And persisted for long minutes when he left. </seg>
<seg id="251"> I worked six days a week, half a day on Sunday, </seg>
<seg id="252"> From 5 am to midnight. </seg>
<seg id="253"> Our meals were poor but frequent, to withstand better. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Two breakfasts, two lunches and a nightly meal. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Monsieur Gustave also held a daily speech. </seg>
<seg id="256"> Rudeness is mere expression of fear. </seg>
<seg id="257"> People are afraid they do not get what they want. </seg>
<seg id="258"> The most disagreeable and horrible person just needs to be loved, </seg>
<seg id="259"> And it will open like a flower. </seg>
<seg id="260"> There is a way out: </seg>
<seg id="261"> "The painter's brush kissed that young niffon </seg>
<seg id="262"> "With her agile bristles </seg>
<seg id="263"> "And with his pompous voice, he restored his empty goats." </seg>
<seg id="264"> She was eating her dinner alone in her room. </seg>
<seg id="265"> The hotel owner's identity was unknown to us all. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Each month his emissary, known as Vice Kovacs, </seg>
<seg id="267"> To check the logs and communicate messages </seg>
<seg id="268"> On behalf of the mysterious owner. </seg>
<seg id="269"> On these occasions, Monsieur Gustave and our trade manager, </seg>
<seg id="270"> Herr Becker, they met him privately over the Reception. </seg>
<seg id="271"> It was then that I met Agatha, </seg>
<seg id="272"> But we will not talk about it. </seg>
<seg id="273"> - What do you want? - Look. </seg>
<seg id="274"> Good God. </seg>
<seg id="275"> I'm sorry, sir. </seg>
<seg id="276"> - We have to go to her. - We have to? </seg>
<seg id="277"> Tout de suite. You need me, and I need you for the bags and so on. </seg>
<seg id="278"> - How can you crawl out? - 5 minutes. </seg>
<seg id="279"> Just do it. And he brought a bottle of Pouilly-Jouvet of '26 </seg>
<seg id="280"> In a bucket of ice with two glasses </seg>
<seg id="281"> So it will not touch the cat's pussy that they serve in the carriage restaurant. </seg>
<seg id="282"> It's all my fault. </seg>
<seg id="283"> He tried to tell me about his premonition. I did not hear it. </seg>
<seg id="284"> The whole Lutz will be in mourning, </seg>
<seg id="285"> Except his fake, demonic children </seg>
<seg id="286"> Which she hated and could not bear to kiss on her cheek. </seg>
<seg id="287"> They will be dancing like gypsies. </seg>
<seg id="288"> Nothing really makes sense, in life, </seg>
<seg id="289"> Since it can end all from one moment to the next ... </seg>
<seg id="290"> And immediately afterwards, comes the rigor mortis. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Oh, the best always die young. </seg>
<seg id="292"> With a little luck, he left some Klubeck to your old friend, </seg>
<seg id="293"> But you never know until the ink on the death certificate is dry. </seg>
<seg id="294"> It was a bed-bomb, among other things. </seg>
<seg id="295"> He was 84, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="296"> I had older ones. </seg>
<seg id="297"> As young people, they all point to the fillet and the lettuce, </seg>
<seg id="298"> But over the years we have to move on less valuable cuts, </seg>
<seg id="299"> What is good for me, because they prefer them. </seg>
<seg id="300"> They are more flavorful, or so they say. </seg>
<seg id="301"> Why are we stuck in a barley field? </seg>
<seg id="302"> Hey, hello, folks. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Documents. </seg>
<seg id="304"> With pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="305"> The photo does not honor me, I'm afraid. </seg>
<seg id="306"> I was considered a very nice man. </seg>
<seg id="307"> What's the "F" for? Fritz? Franz? </seg>
<seg id="308"> - Franz. - I knew it! </seg>
<seg id="309"> He's making a grimace. </seg>
<seg id="310"> It's a residence permit with a third-tier employee status, my dear Franz. </seg>
<seg id="311"> And with me. </seg>
<seg id="312"> Come on, please. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Wait a minute. Sit down, Zero. His visas are in order. </seg>
<seg id="314"> I personally checked them with the Bureau of Labor and Servitude. </seg>
<seg id="315"> He can not stop him just because he is a damn immigrant. </seg>
<seg id="316"> He did nothing. </seg>
<seg id="317"> Stop it, damn it! </seg>
<seg id="318"> No matter, Monsieur Gustave! Let them do it! </seg>
<seg id="319"> Ow! Ouch! </seg>
<seg id="320"> Damned, Dirty, Disgusting Fascist beasts! </seg>
<seg id="321"> Keep your hands down from my Lobby Boy! </seg>
<seg id="322"> What's the problem? </seg>
<seg id="323"> All this is shameful. </seg>
<seg id="324"> This young man works for me at the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad. </seg>
<seg id="325"> Monsieur Gustave? </seg>
<seg id="326"> My name is Henckels. </seg>
<seg id="327"> I am the son of Dr. Wolfgang Henckels-Bergersdofer. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Do you remember me? </seg>
<seg id="329"> I know perfectly well who you are. It's incredible. You are the little Albert. </seg>
<seg id="330"> I'm terribly embarrassed. Free them. </seg>
<seg id="331"> Free them. </seg>
<seg id="332"> His colleague is stateless. </seg>
<seg id="333"> He must apply for a revision of the Special Transit Permit, </seg>
<seg id="334"> Which at this point could be very difficult to obtain. </seg>
<seg id="335"> Take this. </seg>
<seg id="336"> It's on time, but I'm afraid it's the maximum I can do. </seg>
<seg id="337"> How is her beautiful mother? </seg>
<seg id="338"> - Very well, thank you. - I love it. </seg>
<seg id="339"> - greet you warmly. - I will do it. </seg>
<seg id="340"> His traveling companion was kind as I was when I was a sad child. </seg>
<seg id="341"> My men and I are sorry to bother you. </seg>
<seg id="342"> I beg your pardon, sir. </seg>
<seg id="343"> See? There are still dim shades of civilization </seg>
<seg id="344"> In this wild slaughterhouse we called humanity. </seg>
<seg id="345"> It is exactly what we represent in our humble, insignificant ... </seg>
<seg id="346"> Oh, but I'm screaming. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Where is Clotilde? Bring it to me. </seg>
<seg id="348"> You're so beautiful, my dear. Really. </seg>
<seg id="349"> They did a great job. </seg>
<seg id="350"> I do not know what products they used there in the morgue, </seg>
<seg id="351"> But I also want a little. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In sincerity, you are better than it has been in recent years. </seg>
<seg id="353"> You seem almost alive. </seg>
<seg id="354"> Oh, you changed her in the end. It's perfect. </seg>
<seg id="355"> - Clotilde? - Oui, Monsieur Gustave? </seg>
<seg id="356"> A glass of cold water, without ice, for pleasure </seg>
<seg id="357"> Ah. All right. </seg>
<seg id="358"> I will not go very much, dear. </seg>
<seg id="359"> We were escorted through a green cloth door, </seg>
<seg id="360"> In a narrow corridor of service and in the pantry. </seg>
<seg id="361"> A moment later, the kitchen door opened </seg>
<seg id="362"> And a minute white housewife dressed brilliantly. </seg>
<seg id="363"> I never forgot the expression on her face. </seg>
<seg id="364"> What the hell is going on? </seg>
<seg id="365"> I had never set foot in a home like that in my life. </seg>
<seg id="366"> I knew very little about subsequent events. </seg>
<seg id="367"> But at some point I realized that, </seg>
<seg id="368"> When the destiny of a great fortune is in the dance, </seg>
<seg id="369"> Greed goes into the veins like a poison. </seg>
<seg id="370"> Uncles, grandchildren, cousins, </seg>
<seg id="371"> More and more vile relatives. </seg>
<seg id="372"> The widest family of the elderly woman </seg>
<seg id="373"> Spit out like cockroaches in search of food. </seg>
<seg id="374"> At the head of that congregation, incredible coincidence, </seg>
<seg id="375"> We found our Vice Kovacs, </seg>
<seg id="376"> Himself an important notary. </seg>
<seg id="377"> He was the performer of the widow's will. </seg>
<seg id="378"> This is Madame D.'s will. </seg>
<seg id="379"> It consists of a document </seg>
<seg id="380"> Written before the death of her husband 46 years ago, </seg>
<seg id="381"> And 635 amendments, </seg>
<seg id="382"> Notes, corrections and letters of intent. </seg>
<seg id="383"> Added over the next decades. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The definitive legitimacy of this collection </seg>
<seg id="385"> Requires further analysis, </seg>
<seg id="386"> But in the opinion of this office, it was Madame D's intention </seg>
<seg id="387"> That the control of most of his legacy </seg>
<seg id="388"> Had been transferred to his son, Dmitri, </seg>
<seg id="389"> With special diaries for her sisters, </seg>
<seg id="390"> Marguerite, Laetitia and Carolina, </seg>
<seg id="391"> To smaller gifts to several members of the extended family </seg>
<seg id="392"> As indicated in the Beneficiaries List, which I will read in due course. </seg>
<seg id="393"> Nevertheless. </seg>
<seg id="394"> An additional code, </seg>
<seg id="395"> Arrived in my possession by post just this morning, </seg>
<seg id="396"> And, without any doubt, sent by Madame D </seg>
<seg id="397"> In his last hours of life, </seg>

<seg id="425"> Call the police. We dispute denunciation. </seg>
<seg id="426"> This criminal has afflicted my family for almost 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="427"> He's a ruthless adventurer and a cheater </seg>

<seg id="439"> That painting, Boy with Apple, has no price. I got it? </seg>
<seg id="440"> Congratulations, Monsieur Gustave! </seg>

<seg id="465"> This could be a difficult war and a long lease of the hotel. </seg>

<seg id="468"> We contact the black market and sell Boy with Apple </seg>
<seg id="469"> By week, </seg>

<seg id="473"> And of your service as my personal valet, </seg>

<seg id="475"> - 1.5%? - More food and lodging. </seg>
<seg id="476"> - Can we not make 10%? - 10%? Do you mind me? </seg>
<seg id="477"> It's more than I owe a real art merchant, </seg>
<seg id="478"> And you would not distinguish a chiaroscuro from a bunch of chicken offal. </seg>
<seg id="479"> No, 1.5 is right. But you can hear it here: </seg>
<seg id="480"> If I die first, and it will surely be so, you will be my only heir. </seg>
<seg id="481"> There is not much in the dish, apart from a set of ivory brushes </seg>

<seg id="484"> Along with everything we did not spend in whiskey and prostitutes. </seg>
<seg id="485"> This is our sacred covenant. </seg>

<seg id="488"> Today, October 19, in the year of the Lord 1932 ... </seg>
<seg id="489"> He never told me where to come from. </seg>
<seg id="490"> I never wondered where his family was. </seg>
<seg id="491"> Excuse me. </seg>
<seg id="492"> There is the police. They ask for her. </seg>
<seg id="493"> Tell them to arrive right away. </seg>
<seg id="494"> Okay. </seg>
<seg id="495"> Have you ever been questioned by the authorities? </seg>
<seg id="496"> Yes, I was once detained and tortured by rebel militias </seg>
<seg id="497"> After the Desert Insurrection. </seg>
<seg id="498"> - You know how it works, then. Shut up. - Sure. </seg>
<seg id="499"> You've never heard the word "van Hoytl" in your life. Okay, let's go. </seg>
<seg id="500"> How can I help you? </seg>
<seg id="501"> Ah, Inspector Henckels. </seg>
<seg id="502"> "By order of the Police Commissioner in the province of Zubrowka, </seg>
<seg id="503"> "I declare her in custody for the murder </seg>
<seg id="504"> "By Madame Ceine Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis." </seg>
<seg id="505"> I knew there was something suspicious about. We have not been told the cause of death. </seg>
<seg id="506"> She was killed and you believe it was me. </seg>
<seg id="507"> Hey! </seg>
<seg id="508"> Stop! </seg>
<seg id="509"> What happened? </seg>
<seg id="510"> It's happened, my dear Zero, that I made a butt like this </seg>
<seg id="511"> To a whimsical fever called Pinky Bandinski </seg>
<seg id="512"> Who had the urge to question my virility, </seg>
<seg id="513"> Because if there is one thing we learned from appendix novels, </seg>
<seg id="514"> Is that when you're in a place like this, </seg>
<seg id="515"> You never have to be a little girl. </seg>
<seg id="516"> You have to show yourself up right from the first moment. </seg>
<seg id="517"> You have to earn their respect. </seg>
<seg id="518"> You should see her gloomy grunts. </seg>
<seg id="519"> In fact, he became a dear friend. </seg>
<seg id="520"> You will know it, I hope. </seg>
<seg id="521"> So. Did you talk to Kovacs? </seg>
<seg id="522"> I saw him last night, secretly. </seg>
<seg id="523"> He made me swear on a bible that I would not have told anyone. </seg>
<seg id="524"> - You must do it too. - I'll do it later. </seg>
<seg id="525"> - You suspect you're innocent. - Obviously. </seg>
<seg id="526"> What is the charge? </seg>
<seg id="527"> At the small hours of the evening of October 19th, </seg>
<seg id="528"> A man known as Monsieur Gustave H, </seg>
<seg id="529"> Has arrived at the residence of the Desgoffe und Taxis in Lutz </seg>
<seg id="530"> And entered the service door, </seg>
<seg id="531"> Without being seen by anyone, </seg>
<seg id="532"> Proceeding for the service staircase and the servitude corridor, </seg>
<seg id="533"> It was introduced to Madame D.'s private rooms. </seg>
<seg id="534"> There is no evidence to indicate whether the visit </seg>
<seg id="535"> Has been agreed with her or not. </seg>
<seg id="536"> The next morning, Madame D was found dead for stinging poisoning. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Monsieur Gustave was no longer seen in the building </seg>
<seg id="538"> Up to 24 hours later. </seg>
<seg id="539"> The identity of the accusers is explicit in the documents filed. </seg>
<seg id="540"> These include, essentially, all members of the extended family, </seg>
<seg id="541"> But the key witness, who seems to have seen the alleged events </seg>
<seg id="542"> Seems to have left jurisdiction. </seg>
<seg id="543"> His position is unknown at the time, </seg>
<seg id="544"> But the competent authorities continue their research. </seg>
<seg id="545"> Who is it? </seg>
<seg id="546"> - Serge? - I'm afraid of that. </seg>
<seg id="547"> That bastard. </seg>
<seg id="548"> No I do not believe it. They forced him. </seg>
<seg id="549"> I've been in a viper's nest. </seg>
<seg id="550"> Do you have an alibi? </seg>
<seg id="551"> Sure, but he is married to the Duke of Westphalia. </seg>
<seg id="552"> I can not allow her name to be contaminated by these dirty business. </seg>
<seg id="553"> - It's a matter of life or death. - I know, but that bastards if it's shaken. </seg>
<seg id="554"> He is already aboard Queen Nasstasja, towards the Dutch Tanganyka. </seg>
<seg id="555"> Not soft. </seg>
<seg id="556"> The details of the conspiracy, </seg>
<seg id="557"> Nowadays of public domain, </seg>
<seg id="558"> They were, at times, inscrutable to us. </seg>
<seg id="559"> I am looking for Serge X, </seg>
<seg id="560"> A man at the service of my employers, </seg>
<seg id="561"> The Desgoffe und taxis family of Schloss Lutz. </seg>
<seg id="562"> - Yes, sir? - And his sister? </seg>
<seg id="563"> - Yes, sir. - Have you seen him recently? </seg>
<seg id="564"> - No, sir. - Nossignore? </seg>
<seg id="565"> No, yes. </seg>
<seg id="566"> I have to find it as soon as possible, for good </seg>
<seg id="567"> And that of everyone else. </seg>
<seg id="568"> If you see ... </seg>
<seg id="569"> - Yes, sir? - Tell him that Jopling said, </seg>
<seg id="570"> "Back home." </seg>
<seg id="571"> But one thing was certain, </seg>
<seg id="572"> Desfogge und Taxis were a very powerful family, </seg>
<seg id="573"> And time did not play for our benefit. </seg>
<seg id="574"> A letter from Monsieur Gustave. Zero. </seg>
<seg id="575"> - You want me ... - Read it. </seg>
<seg id="576"> "My dear and trusted colleagues ..." </seg>
<seg id="577"> I miss a lot as I write to you from the chains </seg>
<seg id="578"> Of my unpleasant and senseless imprisonment. </seg>
<seg id="579"> Until I am again free to be among you, </seg>
<seg id="580"> Grand Budapest is in your hands, </seg>
<seg id="581"> As well as its impeccable reputation. </seg>
<seg id="582"> Immaculate and honored mantle. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Be cautious of his tiniest piece </seg>
<seg id="584"> As if looking from above like a hawk </seg>
<seg id="585"> With a whip between claws, because that's what I do. </seg>
<seg id="586"> You must discover a lack of any kind during my absence, </seg>
<seg id="587"> I swear that justice will plummet on you, swift and ruthless. </seg>
<seg id="588"> A great and noble house has been placed under your protection. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Tell Zero any strangeness. </seg>
<seg id="590"> "Your devout Monsieur Gustave." </seg>
<seg id="591"> Then there is a poem, but maybe it's best to start the soup </seg>
<seg id="592"> Since they are 46 verses. </seg>
<seg id="593"> "A rude black ash inhales the debris of a rat's dagger </seg>
<seg id="594"> "And mixes with the dense stream of marble wood </seg>
<seg id="595"> "While the chanting of a troglodyte ..." </seg>
<seg id="596"> I never trusted that butler. </seg>
<seg id="597"> - It's too honest. - Too honest, you say? </seg>
<seg id="598"> Well, as it is, I find it quickly and solve it. </seg>
<seg id="599"> Can I offer you a soup dish? </seg>
<seg id="600"> No? Nobody? </seg>
<seg id="601"> You, with the big scar on your face? </seg>
<seg id="602"> Try it. It is very warm and nutritious this evening. </seg>
<seg id="603"> It takes a pinch of salt. </seg>
<seg id="604"> Good day. </seg>
<seg id="605"> Damn it, gentlemen? Who wants it? </seg>
<seg id="606"> I'm fine. </seg>
<seg id="607"> It's time to get up, hop, hop. </seg>
<seg id="608"> Good morning, Pinky. </seg>
<seg id="609"> - Again Mendl? - That's right. </seg>
<seg id="610"> Who has the cutter blade? </seg>
<seg id="611"> - On another planet. - Mendl is the best. </seg>
<seg id="612"> - Well, at work. - Monsieur Gustave? </seg>
<seg id="613"> Yup? </seg>
<seg id="614"> I and the guys discussed it. </seg>
<seg id="615"> We believe she is a really good guy. </seg>
<seg id="616"> Well, I've never been blamed for so much, </seg>
<seg id="617"> But I appreciate the intention. </seg>
<seg id="618"> She is one of us now. </seg>
<seg id="619"> What a nice thing to say. </seg>
<seg id="620"> Thank you, dear Pinky. Thank you, Gunther. </seg>
<seg id="621"> Thank you, Wolf. </seg>
<seg id="622"> Anything else? </seg>
<seg id="623"> Tell him, Ludwig. </seg>
<seg id="624"> The Checkpoint 19 is not a two-money cage. </seg>
<seg id="625"> There are thick iron bars at each door, vent and window. </seg>
<seg id="626"> There are 72 guards on the plane, and another 16 in the towers. </seg>
<seg id="627"> There is a 100-meter jump in a moat full of crocodiles. </seg>
<seg id="628"> But, like all the prisons, it has a weak point, </seg>
<seg id="629"> Which in this case has the form </seg>
<seg id="630"> Of a sewerage system to caduceo </seg>
<seg id="631"> Built at the time of the first fortification of this fort </seg>
<seg id="632"> In the far Middle Ages. </seg>
<seg id="633"> Now, no one says it's a walk along a tree-lined avenue </seg>
<seg id="634"> With an elegant woman and a white poodle, </seg>
<seg id="635"> But it is what is called "vulnerability" </seg>
<seg id="636"> And this is our daily bread. </seg>
<seg id="637"> Look. </seg>
<seg id="638"> Who designed it? </seg>
<seg id="639"> What do you mean? I designed it. </seg>
<seg id="640"> Beautiful, you have a wonderful trait, Ludwig. </seg>
<seg id="641"> You have a huge artistic talent. </seg>
<seg id="642"> Question: How do you intend to penetrate these foundations? </seg>
<seg id="643"> I am 60cm of reinforced granite masonry, right? </seg>
<seg id="644"> Digging with the cutter blade, </seg>
<seg id="645"> I suppose they want us from three to six months of continuous commitment, </seg>
<seg id="646"> During which many of our members </seg>
<seg id="647"> Will be violently executed. </seg>
<seg id="648"> He hit the sign, Mr. Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="649"> We have fake documents, second-hand civilian clothes, </seg>
<seg id="650"> A rope staircase made with staves and sheets, </seg>
<seg id="651"> But we need tools to dig, </seg>
<seg id="652"> Which are difficult to find in this body. </seg>
<seg id="653"> At this point in history, </seg>
<seg id="654"> The man shuddered and pulled away his lambskin shoulder. </seg>
<seg id="655"> His eyes darkened like a stormy sky. </seg>
<seg id="656"> It was obviously difficult. </seg>
<seg id="657"> - What's wrong, Mr. Moustafa? - I decided to ask him. </seg>
<seg id="658"> - No, my dear, at all. - He answered. </seg>
<seg id="659"> It's just that I do not know how to move on. </seg>
<seg id="660"> He was crying. </seg>
<seg id="661"> You see, I never talk about Agatha, </seg>
<seg id="662"> Because only the thought of his name </seg>
<seg id="663"> I lose control of my emotions. </seg>
<seg id="664"> Well, I guess it's useless to turn around. </seg>
<seg id="665"> You see, she saved us. </seg>
<seg id="666"> On the day of our third appointment, </seg>
<seg id="667"> I asked for his hand, and she consented. - </seg>
<seg id="668"> - Do you want to marry me? - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="669"> We did not even have 50 Klubeck in two - </seg>
<seg id="670"> Nobody knew, of course, but to whom would it be imported? </seg>
<seg id="671"> We were both entirely alone in the world, </seg>
<seg id="672"> And we were madly in love </seg>
<seg id="673"> - Here. - Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="674"> - It's a book. - I see. </seg>
<seg id="675"> Romantic Poetry, Volume I. </seg>
<seg id="676"> Recommended by Monsieur Gustave. I also have a copy of it. </seg>
<seg id="677"> - I ruined the surprise, I imagine. - I'll open it anyway. </seg>
<seg id="678"> Read the dedication. </seg>
<seg id="679"> Monsieur Gustave kept us </seg>
<seg id="680"> To an immediate and scrupulous cross-examination. </seg>
<seg id="681"> Is enchanting. Absolutely lovely. </seg>
<seg id="682"> During which she gave Agatha a porcelain pendant </seg>
<seg id="683"> And five dozen white tulips </seg>
<seg id="684"> In a box of the dimensions of a baby coffin. </seg>
<seg id="685"> - He does not feel good. - How, excuse me? </seg>
<seg id="686"> Why is he jealous? </seg>
<seg id="687"> She is my girlfriend. She can not give her gifts. </seg>
<seg id="688"> I'm just asking a few questions about this delightful vision for you. </seg>
<seg id="689"> Never be jealous, Zero, not even for a moment. </seg>
<seg id="690"> Are you trying with us? </seg>
<seg id="691"> - Yes. - I approve this union. </seg>
<seg id="692"> Agatha, honey, come back to your beloved. </seg>
<seg id="693"> Soon we discovered ... </seg>
<seg id="694"> I wish you all the good. </seg>
<seg id="695"> That Agatha was not just phenomenal </seg>
<seg id="696"> With the dough spatula and the cream seals ... </seg>
<seg id="697"> - Mendl. - Go. </seg>
<seg id="698"> But that was also incredibly brave. </seg>
<seg id="699"> I think she was born. </seg>
<seg id="700"> Something is missing. </seg>
<seg id="701"> A crucial, lost or most likely destroyed document- </seg>
<seg id="702"> I do not know what it is, I do not know what it is, </seg>
<seg id="703"> I do not know what it is, </seg>
<seg id="704"> But there are tracks everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="705"> Now, I do not want to alarm her, </seg>
<seg id="706"> And I do not expect to see significant changes </seg>
<seg id="707"> In the decisions of the magistrate about his inheritance, </seg>
<seg id="708"> But, above all, given the circumstances of death, </seg>
<seg id="709"> And the disappearance of the key witness of the murder, Serge X, </seg>
<seg id="710"> I suggest bringing this case </seg>
<seg id="711"> To the attention of the municipal inspector </seg>
<seg id="712"> So there is no doubt in the future, </seg>
<seg id="713"> On the legitimacy of the verdict. </seg>
<seg id="714"> - Agree? - Do not agree. </seg>
<seg id="715"> - Do not agree? - Do not agree. </seg>
<seg id="716"> - May I ask you a question, Vilmos? - Of course, Dmitri. </seg>
<seg id="717"> - Who do you work for? - How do you say? </seg>
<seg id="718"> Who do you work for? I thought we were our lawyer. </seg>
<seg id="719"> Well, technically I'm the will of the will. </seg>
<seg id="720"> In this situation, I represent the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="721"> Oh yes? </seg>
<seg id="722"> Yes. Paying my services was included in the ... </seg>
<seg id="723"> Put things in place and do not create problems, okay? </seg>
<seg id="724"> I'm a notary. I am obliged to act according to law. </seg>
<seg id="725"> Do not agree. </seg>
<seg id="726"> This thing stinks, sisters. </seg>
<seg id="727"> Did my cat knock out the window? </seg>
<seg id="728"> I do not think so. </seg>
<seg id="729"> - No, did not you do that? - Who, Jopling? </seg>
<seg id="730"> Okay. </seg>
<seg id="731"> There is something I did not tell you, Agatha. </seg>
<seg id="732"> - Okay. We stole a picture. </seg>
<seg id="733"> It is very precious, perhaps 5 million of Klubeck, in fact. </seg>
<seg id="734"> I do not know if you have noticed the theft </seg>
<seg id="735"> But if something happened to me ... </seg>
<seg id="736"> Rubi works of art? </seg>
<seg id="737"> Just one picture. However, we must have a plan for your survival. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Keep this. It's code and you'll need a lens to read it, </seg>
<seg id="739"> There is exactly where and how to find Boy with Apple. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Do not accept less than half the sale price. Furthermore... </seg>
<seg id="741"> - Zero, I'm a fornaia. - You're a baker. </seg>
<seg id="742"> I'm not a recipe, that's the point. </seg>
<seg id="743"> I do not sell stolen items. </seg>
<seg id="744"> I said that badly. She wanted him to have him. </seg>
<seg id="745"> Go to sleep. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Yes, Herr Mendl. </seg>
<seg id="747"> - Keep it. - No. </seg>
<seg id="748"> Okay, but take the same. </seg>
<seg id="749"> The following day, Herr Becker received a strange one </seg>
<seg id="750"> News of the last hour from the office of Vice Kovacs, </seg>
<seg id="751"> That postponed the scheduled appointment, forever. </seg>
<seg id="752"> Let's get out. </seg>
<seg id="753"> - What are you doing out there? - Close that sewer. </seg>
<seg id="754"> These are here trying to escape. </seg>
<seg id="755"> What the hell is that gonna take you, a wicked spy? </seg>
<seg id="756"> Guards! Guards! </seg>
<seg id="757"> It is you. Thank you. Thanks, gentle, kind friend. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Okay. </seg>
<seg id="759"> I think you can call a draw. </seg>
<seg id="760"> Good evening. </seg>
<seg id="761"> Let me present you. Pinky, Wolf, Ludwig, this is the divine Zero. </seg>
<seg id="762"> Gunther was killed in the catacombs. </seg>
<seg id="763"> Well, guys, who knows when we will meet again, but if one day ... </seg>
<seg id="764"> Wait. </seg>
<seg id="765"> There is no time for the talk. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Take care of her, Mr. Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="767"> Good luck, boy. </seg>
<seg id="768"> - Where is the refuge? - I did not find it. </seg>
<seg id="769"> No shelter? Seriously? Are we alone out here? </seg>
<seg id="770"> I'm afraid of yes. I asked around, but ... </seg>
<seg id="771"> I see. Too risky. I guess we'll have to improvise. </seg>
<seg id="772"> Let's put on the disguises. </seg>
<seg id="773"> - We already have them. - Not at all. </seg>
<seg id="774"> He had said, fake mustache, bearded, and so on. </seg>
<seg id="775"> - Did not you bring anything? - I thought you'd grow it. </seg>
<seg id="776"> And it would not have seemed realistic, no? </seg>
<seg id="777"> When they are done well, they are perfectly convincing. </seg>
<seg id="778"> But I understand. That's right. </seg>
<seg id="779"> Give me some splash of Air de Panache, please. </seg>
<seg id="780"> - Can I have a splash? - I've forgotten the Air de Panache. </seg>
<seg id="781"> Have you seriously forgotten the Air de Panache? </seg>
<seg id="782"> Do not believe it, how could you? </seg>
<seg id="783"> I've been in jail, Zero! Can you imagine how humiliating it is? </seg>
<seg id="784"> Puzzo. </seg>
<seg id="785"> Wonderful, right? </seg>
<seg id="786"> I guess I can not wait for better ... where are you from? </seg>
<seg id="787"> - Salim al-Jabat. - That's right. </seg>
<seg id="788"> I guess I can not wait for better at Aq Salim al-Jabat </seg>
<seg id="789"> Where the most precious personal belongings </seg>
<seg id="790"> Are a stack of dusty carpets and a dead goat starving, </seg>
<seg id="791"> And sleeps under a tent, trying to survive the scenes. </seg>
<seg id="792"> But that's not how I trained you. </seg>
<seg id="793"> What a demon possessed you, convincing you to leave </seg>
<seg id="794"> The land to which you so clearly belong </seg>
<seg id="795"> And to travel unusual distances to become a dead immigrant starving </seg>
<seg id="796"> In a cultured and sophisticated society </seg>
<seg id="797"> Who, in all honesty, could quietly do without you? </seg>
<seg id="798"> War. </seg>
<seg id="799"> How do you say? </seg>
<seg id="800"> Well, you see, my dad was murdered </seg>
<seg id="801"> And the rest of my family executed by a platoon of execution. </seg>
<seg id="802"> Our village was razed to the ground </seg>
<seg id="803"> And the survivors were forced to flee. </seg>
<seg id="804"> I left because of the war. </seg>
<seg id="805"> I see. So you're more of a political refugee, right? </seg>
<seg id="806"> Right. </seg>
<seg id="807"> Well, I suppose I have to keep up everything I said. </seg>
<seg id="808"> What stupid idiot I am. A pathetic idiot. </seg>
<seg id="809"> God, that selfish bastard. </seg>
<seg id="810"> This is shameful, and is well below the standards of the Grand Budapest. </seg>
<seg id="811"> I apologize for the name of the hotel. </seg>
<seg id="812"> It is not his fault. He was just angry because I forgot the perfume. </seg>
<seg id="813"> It is not a justification. I need you to live. </seg>
<seg id="814"> You are a dear and protected friend and I am proud of you. </seg>
<seg id="815"> You have to keep it in mind. </seg>
<seg id="816"> I'm desolate, Zero. </seg>
<seg id="817"> We are brothers. </seg>
<seg id="818"> How is our dear Agatha? </seg>
<seg id="819"> "It was at the dawning of your appearance in the moor, </seg>
<seg id="820"> "And therefore I returned, at every dawn, mesmerized, </seg>
<seg id="821"> "To the hollow of the vinegar that bore my chest, for ever ..." </seg>
<seg id="822"> Very well. I stop here because the alarm was ringing, </seg>
<seg id="823"> But remember where you came because I would insist that you continue later. </seg>
<seg id="824"> I want block posts at every crossroads within the 50km radius. </seg>
<seg id="825"> Block trains at each station within 100km. </seg>

<seg id="827"> We perceive every Pretzel-Haus, Waffel-hut, Biergarten </seg>
<seg id="828"> And especially every Grand Hotel from Augenzburg to Zilchbrock. </seg>
<seg id="829"> Those men are dangerous professional criminals. </seg>
<seg id="830"> Or at least three of them. </seg>
<seg id="831"> Who are you? </seg>
<seg id="832"> What's he doing here? Civilians are forbidden access to cells. </seg>
<seg id="833"> - This is a military investigation. - It's Mr. Jopling, sir. </seg>

<seg id="848"> Wait, thank you. </seg>
<seg id="849"> It was not our only hope, I should not have told you of its existence </seg>
<seg id="850"> It is understood that you will never have to talk to a living soul. </seg>
<seg id="851"> - Jury? - Sure. But what is it? </seg>
<seg id="852"> I can not tell you. </seg>

<seg id="861"> We took the responsibility to go away earlier, if so. </seg>
<seg id="862"> Well, through the sewers. Exactly. </seg>
<seg id="863"> Listen, Ivan, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but we're in trouble. </seg>
<seg id="864"> It's an official request. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I formally request the services of the ... </seg>

<seg id="923"> Talk to your sister again, and you're convincing this time. </seg>
<seg id="924"> Damn son of a bitch. </seg>
<seg id="925"> Christ on the Cross! </seg>
<seg id="926"> What the fuck does that mean? </seg>
<seg id="927"> Boy with Apple? I thought I had hidden it. </seg>
<seg id="928"> - Why do you only notice it now? - I thought I was looking at an expert. </seg>
<seg id="929"> Are you taking me for the ass? </seg>
<seg id="930"> I think it was taken by Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="931"> I'm not angry with Serge. </seg>
<seg id="932"> You can not take it with someone for the total lack of moral fiber. </seg>
<seg id="933"> She is a small, scary, cowardly coward. </seg>
<seg id="934"> - It's not your fault, right? - I do not know. It depends. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Well, you can say anything. </seg>
<seg id="936"> "It depends". Obviously it depends. </seg>
<seg id="937"> "Of course that depends," of course it depends. </seg>
<seg id="938"> Yes, I think you are right. Obviously it depends. </seg>
<seg id="939"> This does not mean that I will not stripe that small sewage mud. </seg>
<seg id="940"> Anyway, can I marry you? Celebrate the wedding? </seg>
<seg id="941"> With pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="942"> I have to say that I find that girl absolutely delicious. </seg>
<seg id="943"> Flat like a table, with that huge desire </seg>
<seg id="944"> Shaped on Mexico's face, </seg>
<seg id="945"> To sweat for hours and hours in that tasty kitchen </seg>
<seg id="946"> While Mendl, for genius, </seg>
<seg id="947"> Hangs over her like a clumsy gorilla. </seg>
<seg id="948"> Yet without a doubt, without a question of error, </seg>
<seg id="949"> She is always and incredibly delicious. </seg>
<seg id="950"> Because? </seg>
<seg id="951"> For its purity. </seg>
<seg id="952"> She admires her, too, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="953"> - Really? - Very. </seg>
<seg id="954"> It's a good sign, you know. It means he understands it. </seg>
<seg id="955"> It's important. </seg>
<seg id="956"> Do not try it with her. </seg>
<seg id="957"> A telegram was personally delivered to the girl at 4am. </seg>
<seg id="958"> The envelope was close to the corpse but the contents were not there. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In any case, the telegraphic office holds a copy of the tapes for 24 hours. </seg>
<seg id="960"> I copied it, and here it is: </seg>
<seg id="961"> "Put your bags down, stop. </seg>

<seg id="963"> "The hideout is at Gabelmeister Peak, stop. </seg>
<seg id="964"> "Destroy this message, with affection, stop." </seg>
<seg id="965"> Where's the basket? </seg>
<seg id="966"> Why, from this point, sir? </seg>
<seg id="967"> Wake? Going to the sled? Climbs? </seg>
<seg id="968"> 3 Klubeck. </seg>
<seg id="969"> By express courier, I wrote to Agatha </seg>
<seg id="970"> Telling her to reach us at our hiding place. </seg>

<seg id="975"> As a precaution, we got off the train in hiding </seg>
<seg id="976"> At the freighter just off the station. </seg>
<seg id="977"> Air de Penache. </seg>

<seg id="984"> Is she Monsieur Gustave of the Grand Hotel Nebelsbad Budapest? </seg>
<seg id="985"> Change place with me. </seg>
<seg id="986"> Is she Monsieur Gustave of the Grand Hotel Nebelsbad Budapest? </seg>

<seg id="988"> - She is Monsieur Gustave of ... - Yes, damn it. </seg>
<seg id="989"> Confess. </seg>
<seg id="990"> I'm innocent. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Eh? No, no. </seg>
<seg id="992"> Forgive me, Monsieur Gustave, I did not want to betray her. </seg>
<seg id="993"> They threatened me with death and now they murdered my only family. </seg>
<seg id="994"> No. Who killed this time? </seg>
<seg id="995"> - My lovely sister. - The girl with the wooden leg? </seg>
<seg id="996"> - Yes. - Damned bastards! </seg>
<seg id="997"> I tried to warn you at the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="998"> I know, my friend. Let's leave it behind. </seg>
<seg id="999"> Listen, I hate making it difficult, but I just have to ask her to rehabilitate me. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> - Obviously it is mourning, but ... - There is more. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> - In this story. - I understand, go ahead. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> I was an official witness in Madame D's presence </seg>
<seg id="1003"> Of the writing of a second testament </seg>
<seg id="1004"> To be taken into account only in case of violent death. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> - A second will? - That's right. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> - If it was done out. - That's right. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> - IS...? - But they destroyed it. </seg>
<seg id="1008"> - Oh no. - However... </seg>
<seg id="1009"> - Yup...? - I printed a copy. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> A second copy of the second will? </seg>

<seg id="1012"> What does he say? Where? What the hell are we talking about? </seg>
<seg id="1013"> Do not hold us on the thorns. This is a fucking nightmare. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> Tell us what the fuck's going on! </seg>
<seg id="1015"> Serge? Serge? Serge! </seg>
<seg id="1016"> Devils of hell. They strangled him, poor man. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> Soon! Come on! </seg>
<seg id="1018"> - What do we do if we take it? - I have no idea. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> He is a psychopathic assassin. Let's stop. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> I can not. I can barely steer. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> Pathetic, viscous worm. I hate you. </seg>

<seg id="1085"> I'll blow your ass off your ass once and for all. </seg>
<seg id="1086"> Put the gun down! </seg>
<seg id="1087"> Cease-fire! Cease-fire! </seg>
<seg id="1088"> Stop it! </seg>
<seg id="1089"> Who is shooting who? </seg>
<seg id="1090"> That's Gustave H! Fugitive assassin and art thief. </seg>
<seg id="1091"> I trapped it! </seg>
<seg id="1092"> That's Dmitri Desgoffe und Taxis! </seg>
<seg id="1093"> Responsible for the killings of Vice Kovacs, </seg>
<seg id="1094"> Serge X and her sister's sister, and her own mother! </seg>
<seg id="1095"> Nobody moves. You are all in stopping. </seg>
<seg id="1096"> Who's out at the window? </seg>
<seg id="1097"> Agatha! </seg>
<seg id="1098"> 310 bis. </seg>
<seg id="1099"> Hold on! Arrival! </seg>
<seg id="1100"> There is something behind the ... </seg>
<seg id="1101"> Agatha! </seg>
<seg id="1102"> Agatha! </seg>
<seg id="1103"> - Are you OK? - I think so. </seg>
<seg id="1104"> There's something behind the picture. </seg>
<seg id="1105"> He had left everything to Monsieur Gustave, of course. </seg>
<seg id="1106"> The magician, known as Schloss Lutz, </seg>
<seg id="1107"> The factories that produced weapons, medicines and tissues, </seg>
<seg id="1108"> An important trade union newspaper, </seg>
<seg id="1109"> And perhaps there is already, </seg>
<seg id="1110"> The establishment, the Grand Budapest Hotel. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> He named me his successor, </seg>
<seg id="1112"> And for the duration of the war I served my dormant fatherland </seg>
<seg id="1113"> From behind the desk still in the room next to it. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> It was just like her friends: </seg>
<seg id="1115"> Insecure, vanity, superficial, blond, needing attention. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> In the end it was also rich. </seg>
<seg id="1117"> But he did not manage to become decimated. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> Dear friends, we are here together ... </seg>
<seg id="1119"> Neither did my dear Agatha. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> She and our baby would be killed two years later </seg>
<seg id="1121"> From Prussian influence. A disease from nowhere. </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Today we care about it in a week, but at that time millions of victims were killed. </seg>
<seg id="1123"> On the morning of the 21st day of employment, </seg>
<seg id="1124"> The independent state of Zubrowka </seg>
<seg id="1125"> Officially ceased to exist. </seg>
<seg id="1126"> We moved to Lutz with Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="1127"> Anyway, to answer your first question: </seg>
<seg id="1128"> of course. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> Zero asked me about my humble origins in the hotel industry. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> I've been, for a period considered, the best Lobby Boy </seg>
<seg id="1131"> Who has ever worked at the Grand Budapest. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> I think I can say that. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> This one has finally overtaken me. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> Although, I must say, he had an outstanding master. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> Very true. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> "Wherefore these two heavenly, </seg>
<seg id="1137"> "Joined for a moment, </seg>
<seg id="1138"> "In filling the stratosphere of our starry twin? </seg>
<seg id="1139"> "One from the east, the other from west." </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Very well. </seg>
<seg id="1141"> Do not try it with her. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Why are we still standing on a barley field? </seg>
<seg id="1143"> I find these black uniforms rather slimy. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> Well, hello, folks. We talked just about you. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> - Documents. - With pleasure, as always. </seg>
<seg id="1146"> She is the first member of death squads </seg>
<seg id="1147"> To which I am officially presented. </seg>
<seg id="1148"> How are you doing? </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Plus what change, am I saying good? [The French saying: the more you change the more you are all the same] </seg>
<seg id="1150"> It's a residence permit with a third-tier employee status, my dear, </seg>
<seg id="1151"> Read this. </seg>
<seg id="1152"> - Bait. - Stay there. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> I'll give you my word, if he touches this man with a finger, </seg>
<seg id="1154"> I will see her dismissed with dishonor, </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Tied to the fence and hanged before sunset. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> There are still dim shades of civilization </seg>
<seg id="1157"> In this wild slaughterhouse we called humanity. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> Damned, Dirty, Disgusting Fascist beasts! </seg>
<seg id="1159"> He was one of those. </seg>
<seg id="1160"> What can I say more? </seg>
<seg id="1161"> How's it over? </seg>
<seg id="1162"> It's over when they shot him. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> So everything went to me. </seg>
<seg id="1164"> After dinner, we went to pick up the keys of our rooms, </seg>
<seg id="1165"> But Monsieur Jean was not in his place. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> I suppose he forgot about us. </seg>
<seg id="1167"> Obviously, in recent years, </seg>
<seg id="1168"> Properties such as the Grand Budapest </seg>
<seg id="1169"> Have become, with very few exceptions, public goods. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Although the exact terms of the contract </seg>
<seg id="1171"> With the new government have never been made public, </seg>
<seg id="1172"> The outcome is obvious to all: </seg>
<seg id="1173"> Zero Moustafa poured a huge fortune </seg>
<seg id="1174"> In exchange for a costly, unprofitable, decadent hotel. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> Because? </seg>
<seg id="1176"> A mere matter of sentimentality? </seg>
<seg id="1177"> It was not from me, it was not for nothing, </seg>
<seg id="1178"> But I felt I had to know, </seg>
<seg id="1179"> For my health, I believe. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> Forgive me if I asked. I hope I have not offended her. </seg>
<seg id="1181"> Of course not. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> Is that the last link with that vanished world? </seg>
<seg id="1183"> His world, if he wants to? </seg>
<seg id="1184"> His world? </seg>
<seg id="1185"> No I do not think so. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> See, we already shared a vocation. </seg>
<seg id="1187"> It would not have been necessary. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> No, I kept the hotel for Agatha. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> We were happy here. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> For a while'. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> To be honest, I believe his world has vanished </seg>
<seg id="1192"> Long before he came in. </seg>
<seg id="1193"> But, I must say, </seg>
<seg id="1194"> It has certainly extended the illusion with infinite grace. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> - Salt? - No, I'll sit here for a while. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Good night, then. </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Next week, </seg>
<seg id="1198"> I went to go and treat myself to South America </seg>
<seg id="1199"> And I started a long wander abroad. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> I did not return to Europe for many years. </seg>
<seg id="1201"> It was a lovely old ruin. </seg>
