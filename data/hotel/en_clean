It is an extremely common mistake, people think the writer's imagination is always at work, that he's constantly inventing an endless supply of incidents and episodes, that he simply dreams up his stories out of thin air.
2
In point of fact, the opposite is true.
3
Once the public knows you're a writer, they bring the characters and events to you and as long as you maintain your ability to look and to carefully listen, these stories will continue to...
4
Stop it. Stop it! Don't! Don't do it!
5
Uh, will continue to seek you out over your lifetime.
6
To him who has often told the tales of others, many tales will be told.
7
Sorry. It's all right.
8
The incidents that follow were described to me exactly as I present them here and in a wholly unexpected way.
9
A number of years ago, while suffering from a mild case of "Scribe's Fever," a form of neurasthenia common among the intelligentsia of that time, I decided to spend the month of August in the spa town of Nebelsbad below the Alpine Sudetenwaltz, and had taken up rooms in the Grand Budapest, a picturesque, elaborate, and once widely celebrated establishment.
10
I expect some of you will know it.
11
It was off season and, by that time, decidedly out of fashion, and it had already begun its descent into shabbiness and eventual demolition.
12
What few guests we were had quickly come to recognize one another by sight as the only living souls residing in the vast establishment, although I do not believe any acquaintance among our number had proceeded beyond the polite nods we exchanged as we passed in the Palm Court, in the Arabian baths, and on board the Colonnade Funicular.
13
We were a very reserved group, it seemed, and, without exception, solitary.
14
Perhaps as a result of this general silence, I had established a casual and bantering familiarity with the hotel's concierge, a West-continental known only as Monsieur Jean, who struck one as being, at once, both lazy and, really, quite accommodating.
15
I expect he was not well paid.
16
In any case, one evening, as I stood conferring elbow-to-elbow with Monsieur Jean, as had become my habit, I noticed a new presence in our company. A small, elderly man, smartly dressed, with an exceptionally lively, intelligent face and an immediately perceptible air of sadness.
17
He was, like the rest of us, alone, but also, I must say, he was the first that struck one as being deeply and truly lonely.
18
A symptom of my own medical condition as well.
19
Who's this interesting old fellow? I inquired of Monsieur Jean.
20
To my surprise, he was distinctly taken aback.
21
Don't you know? He asked.
22
Don't you recognize him?
23
He did look familiar.
24
That's Mr. Moustafa himself.
25
He arrived earlier this morning.
26
This name will no doubt be familiar to the more seasoned persons among you.
27
Mr. Zero Moustafa was at one time the richest man in Zubrowka, and was still indeed the owner of the Grand Budapest.
28
He often comes and stays a week or more, three times a year at least, but never in the season.
29
Monsieur Jean signaled to me and I leaned closer.
30
I'll tell you a secret.
31
He takes only a single-bed sleeping room without a bath in the rear corner of the top floor and it's smaller than the service elevator!
32
It was well known, Zero Moustafa had purchased and famously inhabited some of the most lavish castles and palazzos on the continent.
33
Yet here, in his own nearly empty hotel, he occupied a servant's quarters?
34
At that moment, the curtain rose on a parenthetical, domestic drama... Shit.
35
...which required the immediate and complete attention of Monsieur Jean, but, frankly, did not hold mine for long.
36
However, this premature intermission in the story of the curious, old man had left me, as the expression goes, "gespannt wie ein Flitzebogen," that is, on the edge of my seat, where I remained throughout the next morning, until, in what I have found to be its mysterious and utterly reliable fashion, fate, once again, intervened on my behalf.
37
I admire your work.
38
I beg your pardon?
39
I said, I know and admire your wonderful work.
40
Thank you most kindly, sir.
41
Did Monsieur Jean have a word or two to share with you about the aged proprietor of this establishment? I must confess, I did myself inquire about you. He's perfectly capable, of course, Monsieur Jean but we can't claim he's a first, or, in earnest, even second-rate concierge.
42
But there it is.
43
Times have changed.
44
The thermal baths are very beautiful.
45
They were in their first condition.
46
It couldn't be maintained, of course.
47
Too decadent for current tastes.
48
But I love it all just the same, this enchanting old ruin.
49
How did you come to buy it, if I may ask?
50
The Grand Budapest.
51
I didn't.
52
If you're not merely being polite, and you must tell me if that's the case, but if it genuinely does interest you, may I invite you to dine with me tonight, and it will be my pleasure and, indeed, my privilege to tell you "my story." Such as it is.
53
Two ducks roasted with olives.
54
Rabbit, salad?
55
Pouilly-Jouvet '52, plus a split of the brut.
56
That should provide us ample time if I commence promptly.
57
By all means.
58
Well, it begins, as it must, with our mutual friend's predecessor.
59
The beloved, original concierge of The Grand Budapest.
60
It begins, of course, with...
61
- Bring the table to the window. - Yes, Monsieur Gustave.
62
- Bring the tray to the table. - Right away, Monsieur Gustave.
63
Right there. Have those been brushed and blocked?
64
Of course, Monsieur Gustave. Pack them in the hat boxes.
65
Is that from Oberstdorf & Company?
66
I believe so, Monsieur Gustave.
67
Second trunk. Who has the tickets? I do, Monsieur Gustave.
68
Give them to me.
69
These are in order. Wait in the corner.
70
- I'm not leaving.
71
- I beg your pardon?
72
- I'm not leaving. - Why not?
73
- I'm frightened. - Of what?
74
I fear this may be the last time we ever see each other.
75
Why on earth would that be the case?
76
Well, I can't put it into words, but I feel it.
77
For goodness sake, there's no reason for you to leave us if you'd...
78
- Come with me. - To fucking Lutz?
79
- Please. - Give me your hand.
80
You've nothing to fear. You're always anxious before you travel.
81
I admit, you appear to be suffering a more acute attack on this occasion.
82
But, truly and honestly... Oh, dear God.
83
What have you done to your fingernails?
84
- I beg your pardon? - This diabolical varnish.
85
- The color is completely wrong. - Don't you like it?
86
It's not that I don't like it. I am physically repulsed.
87
- Perhaps this will soothe you. - What? Don't recite.
88
Just listen to the words. Hush. Please. Not now.
89
"While questing once in noble wood of gray, medieval pine, I came upon a tomb, rain-slick'd, rubbed-cool, ethereal, 'its inscription long-vanished, yet still within its melancholy fissures..."
90
Will you light a candle for me, please?
91
- In the sacristy of Santa Maria?
92
- I'll see to it myself immediately.
93
Remember, I'm always with you.
94
I love you.
95
I love you.
96
It's quite a thing winning the loyalty of a woman like that for 19 consecutive seasons.
97
Um... Yes, sir.
98
She's very fond of me, you know.
99
Yes, sir.
100
But I've never seen her like that before.
101
No, sir.
102
She was shaking like a shitting dog.
103
Truly.
104
Run to the cathedral of Santa Maria in Brucknerplatz.
105
Buy one of the plain, half-length candles and take back four Klubecks in change.
106
Light it in the sacristy, say a brief rosary then go to Mendl's and get me a courtesan au chocolat.
107
If there's any money left, give it to the crippled shoe-shine boy.
108
- Right away, sir. - Hold it.
109
- Who are you?
110
- I'm Zero, sir. The new Lobby Boy.
111
- Zero, you say? - Yes, sir.
112
- I've never heard of you, never laid eyes on you. - Who hired you?
113
- Mr. Mosher, sir. - Mr. Mosher!
114
Yes, Monsieur Gustave?
115
Am I to understand you've surreptitiously hired this young man in the position of a Lobby Boy?
116
He's been engaged for a trial period, pending your approval.
117
Perhaps, yes. Thank you, Mr. Mosher.
118
You're most welcome, Monsieur Gustave.
119
You're now going to be officially interviewed. Should I go and light the candle first, sir?
120
What? No.
121
Experience?
122
Hotel Kinski, Kitchen Boy, six months.
123
Hotel Berlitz, Mop and Broom Boy, three months.
124
- Before that I was a Skillet Scrubber... - Experience, zero.
125
- Thank you again, Monsieur Gustave.
126
- Straighten that cap, Anatole.
127
- The pleasure's mine, Herr Schneider. - The strap's busted.
128
- These are not acceptable. - I fully agree.
129
- Education? - I studied reading and spelling.
130
I started my primary school. I almost...
131
- Education, zero. - Now it's exploded.
132
Good morning, Cicero. Call the goddamn plumber!
133
This afternoon, Monsieur Gustave?
134
- Without fail, Frau Liebling.
135
- What in hell is this? Not now.
136
Family?
137
Zero.
138
Six, Igor.
139
Why do you want to be a Lobby Boy?
140
Well, who wouldn't, at the Grand Budapest, sir?
141
It's an institution.
142
Very good.
143
- A thousand Klubecks. - My goodness.
144
Were you ever a Lobby Boy, sir?
145
What do you think?
146
Well, I suppose you'd have to start somewhere...
147
Go and light the goddamn candle. Yes, sir.
148
And so, my life began.
149
Junior Lobby Boy in-training, Grand Budapest Hotel, under the strict command of Monsieur Gustave H.
150
I became his pupil, and he was to be my counselor and guardian. GUSTAVE H: What is a Lobby Boy?
151
A Lobby Boy's completely invisible, yet always in sight. A Lobby Boy remembers what people hate. A Lobby Boy anticipates the client's needs before the needs are needed.
152
A Lobby Boy is, above all, discreet to a fault. Our guests know their deepest secrets, some of which are, frankly, rather unseemly, will go with us to our graves. So keep your mouth shut, Zero. - Yes, sir.
153
That's all for now.
154
I began to realize that many of the hotel's most valued and distinguished guests came for him. It seemed to be an essential part of his duties.
155
Ah! ...but I believe it was also his pleasure. The requirements were always the same.
156
They had to be rich, old, insecure, vain, superficial, blonde, needy. Why blonde?
157
Because they all were. He was, by the way, the most liberally perfumed man I had ever encountered. The scent announced his approach from a great distance and lingered for many minutes after he was gone. I worked six days each week plus a half-day Sunday.
158
Our meals were small but frequent, for stamina. Two breakfasts, two lunches and a late supper. Monsieur Gustave also delivered a nightly sermon. Rudeness is merely the expression of fear.
159
People fear they won't get what they want. The most dreadful and unattractive person only needs to be loved, and they will open up like a flower.
160
I am reminded of a verse, "The painter's brush touched the inchoate face by ends of nimble bristles "and with their blush of first color, "rendered her lifeless cheek living."
161
MR. MOUSTAFA: His own dinner, he took alone in his room.
162
The identity of the owner of the hotel was unknown to all of us.
163
Each month, his emissary, known as Deputy Kovacs, arrived to review the books and convey messages on behalf of the mysterious proprietor.
164
On these occasions, Monsieur Gustave and our business manager, Herr Becker, met with him in private consultation above Reception.
165
This was also when I met Agatha, but we won't discuss that. What do you want? Look.
166
Dear God.
167
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
168
We must go to her. - We must?
169
Tout de suite. She needs me, and I need you to help me with my bags and so on.
170
- How fast can you pack? - Five minutes.
171
Do it. And bring a bottle of the Pouilly-Jouvet '26 in an ice bucket with two glasses so we don't have to drink the cat piss they serve in the dining car.
172
I blame myself. She tried to tell me she had a premonition. I didn't listen. All of Lutz will be dressed in black, except her own ghastly, deceitful children whom she loathed and couldn't bear to kiss hello. They'll be dancing like gypsies.
173
There's really no point in doing anything in life, because it's all over in the blink of an eye...
174
And, the next thing you know, rigor mortis sets in. Oh, how the good die young.
175
With any luck, she's left a few Klubecks for your old friend, but one never knows until the ink is dry on the death certificate.
176
She was dynamite in the sack, by the way.
177
She was 84, Monsieur Gustave.
178
I've had older.
179
When you're young, it's all fillet steak, but as the years go by, you have to move on to the cheaper cuts, which is fine with me, because I like those. More flavorful, or so they say.
180
Why are we stopping at a barley field?
181
Well, hello there, chaps. Documents, please. With pleasure.
182
It's not a very flattering portrait, I'm afraid. I was once considered a great beauty.
183
What does the "F" stand for? Fritz? Franz?
184
- Franz. - I knew it!
185
He's making a funny face.
186
That's a Migratory Visa with Stage Three Worker Status, Franz, darling.
187
He's with me.
188
Come outside, please.
189
Now, wait a minute. Sit down, Zero. His papers are in order.
190
I cross-referenced them myself with the Bureau of Labor and Servitude.
191
You can't arrest him simply because he's a bloody immigrant.
192
He hasn't done anything wrong.
193
Stop it, damn you!
194
Never mind, Monsieur Gustave! Let them proceed!
195
Ow! That hurts!
196
You filthy, goddamn, pock-marked, fascist assholes!
197
Take your hands off my Lobby Boy!
198
What's the problem?
199
This is outrageous.
200
The young man works for me at the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad.
201
Monsieur Gustave?
202
My name is Henckels.
203
I'm the son of Dr. and Mrs. Wolfgang Henckels-Bergersdörfer. Do you remember me? I know exactly who you are. It's uncanny. You're little Albert. I'm terribly embarrassed. Release them. Release them.
204
Your colleague is stateless. He'll need to apply for a revised Special Transit Permit, which at this point may be very difficult to acquire. Take this.
205
It's temporary but it's the best I can offer, I'm afraid. And how's your wonderful mother? - She's very well, thank you. - I adore her. - Send my love. - I will.
206
Your companion was very kind to me when I was a lonely little boy.
207
My men and I apologize for disturbing you. I beg your pardon, sir.
208
You see? There are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity.
209
Indeed, that's what we provide in our own modest, humble, insignificant...
210
Oh, fuck it.
211
Where is she, Clotilde? Take me to her. You're looking so well, darling. You really are. They've done a marvelous job.
212
I don't know what sort of cream they've put on you down at the morgue, but I want some. Honestly, you look better than you have in years. You look like you're alive.
213
Oh, you changed it after all. It's perfect. - Clotilde? - Oui, Monsieur Gustave?
214
A glass of chilled water with no ice, please. Oh. All right, then.
215
I shan't be long, darling. We were escorted through a green baize door, down a narrow service corridor and into the butler's pantry.
216
A moment later, the kitchen passage swung open and a small servant dressed in white jolted into the room. I've never forgotten the look on that man's face. What the devil is going on?
217
I, myself, had never set foot inside a house of this kind in my life.
218
I understood very little about the events that were to follow.
219
But, eventually, I came to recognize, when the destiny of a great fortune is at stake, men's greed spreads like a poison in the bloodstream.
220
Uncles, nephews, cousins, in-laws of increasingly tenuous connection. The old woman's most distant relations had come foraging out of the woodwork.
221
At the head of this congregation, it was a disorienting coincidence, we discovered our own Deputy Kovacs, himself an important attorney, of course.
222
He was the executor of the dead widow's estate. This is Madame D's last will and testament.
223
It consists of a general tontine drawn up before the event of her husband's death 46 years ago, in combination with 635 amendments, notations, corrections, and letters of wishes executed during the subsequent decades.
224
The ultimate legality of this accumulation requires further analysis, but in the opinion of this office, it was Madame D's intention that control of the vast bulk of her estate should be transferred, forthwith, to her son, Dmitri, with special allowances for his sisters, Marguerite, Laetizia, and Carolina, and minor gifts for various members of the extended family as shown in the List of Recipients, which I will elucidate in due course.
225
However. An additional codicil, delivered into my possession by post only this morning, and, by all indications, sent by Madame D during the last hours of her life, contains an amendment to the original certificate, which, as prescribed by law, I will read to you now.
226
The authenticity of this document has not yet been confirmed by the presiding magistrate, so I ask that all parties be patient and refrain from comment until such time as our investigations can be completed.
227
"To my esteemed friend who comforted me in my later years "and brought sunshine into the life of an old woman "who thought that she would never be happy again.
228
"Monsieur Gustave H, "I bequeath, bestow and devise, free of all taxation "and with full and absolute fiduciary entitlement, "the painting known as 'Boy with Apple... Wow! "...by Johannes van Hoytl..."
229
I can't believe it. "...the younger..." What? "...which gave us both so much pleasure."
230
The van Hoytl? - Tax-free? - Can she do that? Who's Gustave H?
231
I'm afraid that's me, darling. That fucking faggot! He's a concierge. What are you doing here? I've come to pay my respects to a great woman whom I loved.
232
- This man is an intruder in my home! - It's not yours yet, Dmitri.
233
Only when probate is granted, and the Deed of Entitlement...
234
You're not getting Boy with  Apple, you goddamn little fruit!
235
How's that supposed to make me feel?
236
Call the police. We're pressing charges.
237
This criminal has plagued my family for nearly 20 years.
238
He's a ruthless adventurer and a con-artist who preys on mentally feeble, sick old ladies, and he probably fucks them, too!
239
I go to bed with all my friends. Where's Céline?
240
What? She's dead. We're reading her will.
241
Oh, yes, yes, of course.
242
If I learn you ever once laid a finger on my mother's body, living or dead, I swear to God, I'll out your throat! You hear me?
243
I thought I was supposed to be a fucking faggot. - You are, but you're bisexual. - Let's change the subject. I'm leaving.
244
That picture, Boy with Apple, is priceless. Understand? Congratulations, Monsieur Gustave!
245
They're going to fight me for the son of a bitch. - Is it very beautiful? - Beyond description.
246
"E'en the most gifted bard's rhyme can only sing "but to the lack of her and all she isn't! "His tongue doth..." Can I see it? I don't see why not.
247
This is van Hoytl's exquisite portrayal of a beautiful boy on the cusp of manhood. Blond, smooth. Skin as white as that milk.
248
Of impeccable provenance. One of the last in private hands, and unquestionably, the best. It's a masterpiece.
249
The rest of this shit is worthless junk.
250
What did you want to tell me, before? I think I cannot say right now.
251
Write me tomorrow. Lutzbahn Station! I'll never part with it. It reminded her of me. It will remind me of her. Always. I'll die with this picture above my bed. See the resemblance? Oh, yes. Actually, we should sell it.
252
Sooner rather than later, in case they try to steal it back. Plus, something about those lunatic foot-soldiers on the express...
253
This could be a tricky war and a long dry spell in the hotel trade. For all we know, they could board us up tomorrow. Let's make a solemn blood-pact.
254
We'll contact the black market and liquidate Boy with Apple by the end of the week, then leave the country and lay low somewhere along the Maltese Riviera until the troubles blow over and we resume our posts.
255
In exchange for your help, your loyalty and your services as my personal valet, I pledge to you 1.5% of the net sale price.
256
Could we make it 10? 10? Are you joking? That's more than I'd pay an actual dealer, and you wouldn't know Chiaroscuro from chicken giblets.
257
No, 1.5 is correct. But I'll tell you what, if I die first, and I most certainly will, you will be my sole heir. There's not much in the kitty except a set of ivory-backed hairbrushes and my library of romantic poetry, but when the time comes, these will be yours, along with whatever we haven't already spent on whores and whiskey. This is our sacred bond. I'll draw it up right now.
258
I, Monsieur Gustave H, being of relatively sound mind and body, on this day, the 19th of October, in the year of our Lord 1932...
259
He never told me where he came from. I never asked who his family had been. Excuse me.
260
The police are here. They asked for you. Tell them I'll be right down. Okay.
261
Have you ever been questioned by the authorities? Yes, on one occasion I was arrested and tortured by the rebel militia after the Desert Uprising.
262
You know the drill, then. Zip it. Of course. You've never heard the word "van Hoytl" in your life. Okay, let's go. How may we serve you, gentlemen? Ah, Inspector Henckels.
263
"By order of the Commissioner of Police, Zubrowka Province, "I hereby place you under arrest for the murder "of Madame Céline Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis."
264
I knew there was something fishy. We never got the cause of death. She's been murdered and you think I did it.
265
Hey!
266
Stop!
267
What happened?
268
What happened, my dear Zero, is I beat the living shit out of a sniveling little runt called Pinky Bandinski who had the gall to question my virility, because if there's one thing we've learned from penny dreadfuls, it's that, when you find yourself in a place like this, you must never be a candy-ass.
269
You've got to prove yourself from Day One. You've got to win their respect. You should take a long look at his ugly mug this morning. He's, actually, become a dear friend. You'll meet him, I hope.
270
So. You've talked to Kovacs?
271
I saw him last night in secret.
272
He made me take an oath on a Bible I wouldn't tell a soul.
273
- You're supposed to also. - I'll do that later.
274
- He suspects you're innocent. - Of course he does.
275
What's the charge?
276
In the small hours of the evening of 19 October,
277
an individual well-known to the house and staff, a Monsieur Gustave H, did arrive at the Desgoffe und Taxis residence in Lutz and entered by the rear service alley, alerting no one to his presence,
278
and did then proceed by way of back stairs and servants' passage, to deliver himself into the private chambers of Madame D. There is no evidence to indicate whether this visit had been pre-arranged with her or not.
279
The next morning Madame D was found dead by strychnine poisoning. Monsieur Gustave was not observed on the premises again until, of course, 24 hours later.
280
The identity of his accusers is made clear in this notarized deposition.
281
They include, essentially, all members of the extended family, but the key witness who actually ostensibly saw the alleged events appears to have fled the jurisdiction. His whereabouts are currently unknown, but he's being sought and pursued by the relevant authorities.
282
Who is he?
283
- Serge? - I'm afraid so.
284
That little prick.
285
No, I don't believe it. They put him up to it. I've been dropped into a nest of vipers. You have an alibi?
286
Of course, but she's married to the Duke of Westphalia.
287
I can't allow her name to get mixed-up in all this monkey business.
288
- Your life may be at stake. - I know, but the bitch legged it.
289
She's already on board the Queen Nasstasja halfway to Dutch Tanganyika. Don't give up.
290
The details of the conspiracy, now a matter of public record, were, at that time, impossible for us to apprehend. I'm looking for Serge X, a young man in the service of my employer, the family Desgoffe und Taxis of Schloss Lutz.
291
- Yes, sir? - You're his sister?
292
- Yes, sir. - Seen him lately?
293
- No, sir. - No, sir?
294
- No, sir.
295
I need to find him right away, for his own safety and everybody else's.
296
If he shows up...
297
- Yes, sir? - Tell him Jopling says,
298
"Come home."
299
But one thing was certain, the Desgoffe und Taxis were a very powerful family, and time was not on our side.
300
A letter from Monsieur Gustave. Zero.
301
- You want me to? - Read it.
302
"My dear and trusted colleagues..."
303
I miss you deeply as I write from the confines of my regrettable and preposterous incarceration.
304
Until I walk amongst you again as a free man, the Grand Budapest remains in your hands, as does its impeccable reputation.
305
Keep it spotless and glorify it.
306
Take extra special care of every little-bitty bit of it as if I were watching over you like a hawk with a horse whip in its talons, because I am.
307
Should I discover a lapse of any variety during my absence, I promise, swift and merciless justice will descend upon you. A great and noble house has been placed under your protection. Tell Zero if you see any funny business.
308
"Your devoted Monsieur Gustave."
309
Then there's a poem, but we might want to start on the soup since it's 46 stanzas.
310
"A moist, black ash dampens the filth of a dung-dark rat's nest "and mingles with the thick scent of wood rot "while the lark song of a guttersnipe..."
311
I never trusted that butler.
312
- He's too honest. - Too honest, you say?
313
Mmm-hmm. Right, well, be that as it may, find him quick and make it snappy.
314
May I offer any of you inmates a plate of mush?
315
No? Anyone?
316
You with the very large scar on your face?
317
Try it. It's actually quite warm and nourishing this morning. It needs a dash of salt. Good day.
318
Mush, gents? Any takers? Suit yourselves.
319
Rise and shine. Chop, chop. Good morning, Pinky.
320
- Mendl's again? - Precisely.
321
Who's got the throat slitter? - Out of this world. - Mendl's is the best.
322
- Well, back to work. Monsieur Gustave? Yes?
323
Me and the boys talked it over. We think you're a really straight fellow. Well, I've never been accused of that before, but I appreciate the sentiment.
324
You're one of us now. What a lovely thing to say. Thank you, dear Pinky. Thank you, Gunther. Thank you, Wolf. Anything else? Tell him, Ludwig.
325
Checkpoint 19 ain't no two-bit hoosegow. You got broad-gauge iron bars on every door, vent and window. You got 72 guards on the floor and 16 more in the towers. You got a 325-foot drop into a moat full of crocodiles. But, like the best of them, it's got a soft spot, which in this case happens to take the form of a storm-drain sewer system dating from the time of the original rock fortification way back in the Middle Ages.
326
Now, nobody's saying it's a stroll down a tree-lined promenade with a fine lady and a white poodle, but it's got what you'd call "vulnerability," and that's our bread and butter.
327
Take a look. Who drew this? What do you mean, "Who drew this?" I did.
328
Very good. You've got a wonderful line, Ludwig. This shows great artistic promise. Question, how do you intend to penetrate this lowest rudiment? It's 25 inches of reinforced granite masonry, is it not? Digging with the throat-slitter, I expect this would take three to six months of continual effort, during which time several of our members will have been violently executed.
329
You hit the nail on the head, Mr. Gustave. We got fake documents, second-hand street clothes, a rope ladder made of sticks and bunk-linens, but we need digging tools, which are proving hard to come by in this flop-house. At this point in the story, the old man fell silent and pushed away his saddle of lamb.
330
His eyes went blank as two stones. I could see he was in distress.
331
- Are you ill, Mr. Moustafa? - I finally asked. - Oh, dear me, no. - He said.
332
It's only that I don't know how to proceed. He was crying.
333
You see, I never speak of Agatha, because even at the thought of her name I'm unable to control my emotions. Well, I suppose there's no way around it.
334
You see, she saved us. On our third formal rendezvous, I had asked for her hand in marriage and she had agreed.
335
- Will you marry me? - Yes.
336
We did not have 50 Klubecks between the two of us. No one knew, of course, but, then, who would have cared? We were each completely on our own in the world, and we were deeply in love.
337
- Here. - Thank you. - It's a book. - I see.
338
Romantic Poetry, Volume One. Monsieur Gustave recommended it. I have a copy of my own as well. - I ruined the surprise, I suppose. - I'll go ahead and open it, anyway. Read the inscription.
339
Monsieur Gustave insisted on an immediate and thorough cross-examination.
340
She's charming. She's so charming. ...during which he presented Agatha with a porcelain pendant and five dozen individually tissue-wrapped white tulips in a box the size of a child's coffin.
341
- It's not right. - I beg your pardon?
342
Why is he sulking? She's my girlfriend. You can't just buy her things. I'm only interviewing this vision of loveliness on your behalf.
343
Never be jealous in this life, Zero, not even for an instant. Is he flirting with you?
344
- Yes. - I approve of this union.
345
Agatha, my beauty, return to your beloved. Soon we learned...
346
Blessings upon you both. ...not only was Agatha immensely skilled with a palette knife and a butter-cream flourish...
347
- Mendl. - Go.
348
...she was also very brave.
349
I believe she was born that way. Something's missing. A crucial document, either misplaced or, conceivably, destroyed. I don't know what it contains, I don't know what it represents, I don't know what it is, but there are traces and shadows of it everywhere.
350
Now, I don't want to alarm you, and I don't expect to see any significant change in the magistrate's ultimate decision vis-à-vis your own inheritance, but, especially given the circumstances of the death, as well as the disappearance of the key witness in the murder case, Serge X, I suggest that we immediately bring this matter to the attention of the municipal inspector so that there can be absolutely no question of impropriety at any future date.
351
- Agreed?-  Not agreed. - Not agreed? - Not agreed. - Can I ask you a question, Vilmos? - Yes, Dmitri? - Who are you working for? - I beg your pardon? Who are you working for? I thought you're supposed to be our lawyer. Well, in point of fact, I'm the executor of the estate.
352
In this particular situation, I represent the deceased. Oh, yeah? Yeah. A provision for my fees was included in the... Just wrap it up and don't make waves. Agreed?
353
I'm an attorney. I'm obligated to proceed according to the rule of law. Not agreed. This stinks, sisters. Did he just throw my cat out the window? I don't think so. No. - Did he? - Jopling? Okay.
354
There's something I haven't told you, Agatha. Okay. We stole a painting. It's very valuable, maybe five million Klubecks, in fact. I don't know if anyone's even noticed it's missing yet, but if something should happen to me... You steal art?
355
One picture. Anyway, we need to make a plan for your survival. Hide this. It's in code and you might need a magnifying glass to read it, but it tells you exactly where and how to find Boy with Apple. Don't take less than half the retail asking price. Also...
356
- Zero, I'm a baker. - You're a pastry chef. I'm not a fence, if that's the term. I don't trade in stolen property. I said it wrong. She willed it to him. Go to sleep. Yes, Herr Mendl.
357
- Hide this. - No.
358
Okay, but take it anyway. The next morning, Herr Becker received a peculiar, last-minute notice from the office of Deputy Kovacs, postponing their scheduled meeting, in perpetuity.
359
Let's blow.
360
- How did you get out there? - Shut the fuck up.
361
These guys are trying to escape.
362
What's wrong with you, you goddamn snitch?
363
Guard! Guard!
364
It's you. Thank you.
365
Thank you, you sweet, kind man.
366
Okay.
367
I suppose you'd call that a draw.
368
Good evening.
369
Let me introduce you. Pinky, Wolf, Ludwig, this is the divine Zero.
370
Gunther was slain in the catacombs.
371
Well, boys, who knows when we'll all meet again, but if one day...
372
Hold it.
373
No time to gab.
374
Take care of yourself, Mr. Gustave.
375
Good luck, kid.
376
- Which way to the safe house? - I couldn't find one.
377
No safe house? Really? We're completely on our own out here?
378
I'm afraid so. I asked around, but...
379
I understand. Too risky. We'll just have to wing it, I suppose.
380
Let's put on our disguises.
381
- We're wearing them. - No, we're not.
382
We said false whiskers and fake noses and so on.
383
- You didn't bring any? - I thought you were growing one.
384
And it wouldn't look realistic, would it?
385
No, when done properly, they're perfectly convincing.
386
But I take your point. So be it.
387
Give me a few squirts of L'air de Panache, please, will you?
388
- Can I not get a squirt, even? - I forgot the L'air de Panache.
389
Honestly, you forgot the L'air de Panache?
390
I don't believe it. How could you?
391
I've been in jail, Zero! Do you understand how humiliating this is?
392
I smell.
393
That's just marvelous, isn't it?
394
I suppose this is to be expected back in... Where do you come from again?
395
- Aq Salim al-Jabat. - Precisely.
396
I suppose this is to be expected back in Aq Salim al-Jabat where one's prized possessions are a stack of filthy carpets and a starving goat, and one sleeps behind a tent flap and survives on wild dates and scarabs.
397
But it's not how I trained you.
398
What on God's earth possessed you to leave the homeland where you obviously belong and travel unspeakable distances to become a penniless immigrant in a refined, highly-cultivated society that, quite frankly, could've gotten along very well without you?
399
The war.
400
Say again?
401
Well, you see, my father was murdered and the rest of my family were executed by firing squad. Our village was burned to the ground and those who managed to survive were forced to flee.
402
I left because of the war.
403
I see. So you're, actually, really more of a refugee, in that sense?
404
Truly.
405
Well, I suppose I'd better take back everything I just said. What a bloody idiot I am. Pathetic fool.
406
Goddamn, selfish bastard.
407
This is disgraceful, and it's beneath the standards of the Grand Budapest. I apologize on behalf of the hotel.
408
It's not your fault. You were just upset I forgot the perfume. Don't make excuses for me. I owe you my life.
409
You are my dear friend and protégé and I'm very proud of you.
410
You must know that.
411
I'm so sorry, Zero.
412
We're brothers.
413
How's our darling Agatha?
414
"'Twas first light when I saw her face upon the heath, "and hence did I return, day-by-day, entranced, "tho' vinegar did brine my heart, never..."
415
Very good. I'm going to stop you there because the alarm has sounded, but remember where we left off because I insist you finish later.
416
I want roadblocks at every junction for 50km.
417
I want rail blocks at every train station for 100km.
418
I want 50 men and 10 bloodhounds ready in five minutes. We're going to strip-search every pretzel-Ha us, Waffel-hut, Biergarten and especially every grand hotel from Äugenzburg to Zilchbrück.
419
These men are dangerous, professional criminals. At least three of them are anyway.
420
Who are you?
421
What are you doing here? Civilian personnel aren't permitted in the cellblock. - This is a military investigation. - This is Mr. Jopling, sir. His employer's mother was one of the victims...
422
Shut up.
423
You work for the family Desgoffe und Taxis?
424
Are you aware of the murder of Deputy Vilmos Kovacs on 23rd October?
425
I'm aware of his disappearance.
426
His body was found stuffed in a sarcophagus behind a storage room at the Kunstmuseum late last night.
427
He was short four fingers.
428
- What do you know about that? - Nothing.
429
Escort Mr. Jopling off the premises.
430
Mendl's.
431
Operator, get me the Excelsior Palace in Baden-Jurgen and reverse the charges, please.
432
We've no choice. There's nowhere else to turn.
433
I'll hold. Thank you.
434
It's our only hope. Otherwise, I shouldn't even mention its existence to you.
435
It goes without saying, never breathe a word about this to a living soul.
436
- Do you swear? Of course. - What is it, in fact?
437
I can't say.
438
How does one come by front-row aisle seats for a first night at the Opera Toscana with one day's notice?
439
How does one arrange a private viewing of the tapestry collection at the Royal Saxon Gallery?
440
How does one secure a corner table at Chez Dominique on a Thursday?
441
Ivan, darling, it's Gustave.
442
Well, I was until about five minutes ago.
443
We've taken it upon ourselves to clear out in a hurry if you see what I mean.
444
Well, through a sewer, as it happens. Exactly.
445
Listen, Ivan, I'm sorry to out you off, but we're in a bit of a bind.
446
This is an official request.
447
I'm formally calling upon the special services of...
448
IVAN: I'll call you back, Gustave.
449
Right. Stand by.
450
I beg your pardon. Do you prefer to walk?
451
We're right here. It's very simple.
452
Straight down the corniche, then left.
453
Jojo, see the gentleman out.
454
Get me Monsieur Georges at the Château Luxe, please.
455
Higher, goddammit, higher!
456
Take over.
457
- Monsieur Georges. - Higher.
458
I see. Straightaway.
459
Get me Monsieur Robin at I'Hôtel Côte du Cap, please. ...and two and three.
460
Monsieur Robin. There's a call from Monsieur Dino for you.
461
Take over.
462
- One, two, three. - Yes, Dino.
463
Yes, Dino. Okay, Dino.
464
Get me Monsieur Martin at the Ritz Imperial, please.
465
Too much salt.
466
Not enough pepper.
467
Take over.
468
- Robin? Martin. Too much salt.
469
So I've heard.
470
Maybe. Let me make a few calls.
471
Serge X, missing. Deputy Kovacs, also missing.
472
Madame D, dead. Boy with  Apple, stolen, by us.
473
Dmitri and Jopling, ruthless, cold-blooded savages.
474
Gustave H, at large. What else?
475
- Zero, confused. - Zero, confused, indeed.
476
The plot "thickens," as they say.
477
Why, by the way? Is it a soup metaphor?
478
I don't know.
479
Get in.
480
We found the butler.
481
He's hiding out in the remote foothills near Gabelmeister's Peak.
482
Our contact convinced him to meet you midday tomorrow.
483
at the observatory on the summit.
484
Tell no one. He'll explain everything.
485
Your train departs in four and a half minutes.
486
Here's your tickets.
487
- Third class? - It was overbooked.
488
but the conductor used to be a sommelier at the old Versailles.
489
He pulled some strings.
490
You'll need these for the dining car.
491
One last thing.
492
L'air de Panache.
493
They only had the half-ounce.
494
We should give him something as a symbolic gesture.
495
- How much money you got? - 42 Klubecks and 3 postage stamps.
496
Give me 25. Yes.
497
- Bless you. - Please.
498
- I've got to hand it to him. - Jesus Christ.
499
I didn't see that coming. Well, what do you want next?
500
Talk to the club-footed sister again, and, this time, be persuasive.
501
Goddamn son of a bitch.
502
Holy fuck!
503
What's the meaning of this shit?
504
Boy with Apple? I thought you'd hidden it.
505
Why are you only noticing now? I assumed it went to the tax appraiser.
506
Are you fucking kidding me?
507
I believe it was removed by Monsieur Gustave.
508
I'm not angry with Serge.
509
You can't blame someone for their basic lack of moral fiber.
510
He's a frightened, little, yellow-bellied coward.
511
It's not his fault, is it? I don't know. It depends.
512
Well, you can say that about most anything.
513
"It depends." Of course it depends.
514
Of course it depends. Of course it depends.
515
Yes, I suppose you're right. Of course it depends.
516
That doesn't mean I'm not going to throttle the little swamp rat.
517
May I officiate, by the way? The ceremony?
518
With pleasure.
519
I must say, I find that girl utterly delightful.
520
Flat as a board, enormous birthmark the shape of Mexico over half her face, sweating for hours on end in that sweltering kitchen while Mendl, genius though he is, looms over her like a hulking gorilla. Yet without question, without fail, always and invariably, she's exceedingly lovely.
521
Why?
522
Because of her purity.
523
She admires you as well, Monsieur Gustave.
524
- Does she? - Very much.
525
That's a good sign, you know. It means she "gets it."
526
That's important.
527
Don't flirt with her. A radio telegram was delivered and signed for by the girl at 4:00 AM. The envelope was found near the body, but its contents were missing.
528
However, the telegraph office always keeps a carbon of the ticker tape for 24 hours. I copied it down. It reads as follows, "Pack your things stop.
529
"Be ready to leave at moment's notice stop. "Hide-out is vicinity of Gabelmeister's Peak stop. "Destroy this message all my love full stop."
530
Where's the basket? Where you headed, mister? Skiing? Sledding? Mountain climbing?
531
By express wireless, I wrote Agatha with instructions to move to our pre-arranged hideout, a Gypsy caravan on the outer Nebelsbad road, while Monsieur Gustave and I continued east into the Zubrowkian Alps, toward our high-altitude rendezvous with the butler Serge X. As a precaution, we disembarked quietly in the freight yard just outside the station.
532
L'air de Panache.
533
It's a hell of a view. I give them that, for what's it's worth.
534
I agree. "'Tis oft'-remarked, no single, falling-flake does any other - "in its pure and perfect form..." - Somebody's coming.
535
Are you Monsieur Gustave of the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad?
536
Get on the next cable car.
537
Are you Monsieur Gustave of the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad?
538
Switch with me.
539
Are you Monsieur Gustave of the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad?
540
Put these on and sing.
541
- Are you Monsieur Gustave of the... - Yes, dammit.
542
Confess.
543
I'm innocent.
544
Hmm? No, no.
545
Forgive me, Monsieur Gustave. I never meant to betray you.
546
They threatened my life and now they've murdered my only family. No. Who did they kill this time?
547
- My dear sister. - The girl with the club foot?
548
- Yes. - Those fuckers!
549
I tried to warn you at the beginning.
550
I know, darling. Let's put that behind us.
551
Listen, I hate to put you on the spot, but I really must ask you to clear my name.
552
Obviously you're grieving... There's more. To the story. I get it. Go on.
553
I was the official witness in Madame D's presence to the creation of a second will to be executed only in the event of her death by murder.
554
- A second will? - Right. - In case she got bumped off? - Right.
555
- Uh-huh? - But they destroyed it.
556
- Oh, dear. - However...
557
- Uh-huh? - I pulled a copy. A second copy of the second will?
558
- Right. - Uh-huh?
559
What does it say? Where is it? What's it all about, dammit?
560
Don't keep us in suspense. This has been a complete fucking nightmare.
561
Just tell us what the fuck is going on!
562
Serge? Serge? Serge!
563
Bloody hell. They've strangled the poor slob.
564
Come on! Let's go!
565
- What do we do if we catch him? - I don't know.
566
He's a homicidal psychopath. Let's stop.
567
I can't. I can barely steer.
568
You sick, pathetic creep. I hate you.
569
"'If this do be me end, farewell!' cried the wounded piper-boy, "whilst the muskets cracked and the yeomen roared 'Hurrah!' "And the ramparts fell. "'Methinks me breathes me last, me fears!' said he..."
570
Holy shit! You got him!
571
Well done, Zero!
572
Gustave H! You are a fugitive from justice!
573
Surrender lawfully and I will personally vouchsafe your fair treatment.
574
Do not attempt to flee!
575
- What do you think? - I don't know.
576
I'd rather jump off this cliff right now than go back to fucking prison.
577
I say we steal that sick maniac's motorcycle, go fetch Agatha, take back Boy with Apple and head for the Maltese Riviera, once and for all.
578
Very good! You're so extraordinary, Zero. Thank you.
579
A moment of silence in memoriam of a devoted servant killed violently during the conduct of his duties. Goodbye, Serge.
580
Okay, let's go.
581
The war began at midnight.
582
Pffeifelstad fell by lunch under heavy shelling, and 10 battalions surged across the long western border. High-command advanced to Nebelsbad.
583
Compliments of Herr Mendl, for the executive staff.
584
General Stieglitz requests a garden-view sitting room with an extra roll-away.
585
Let's put him in the Duke Leopold Suite.
586
Secretary Woroniecki's office cabled.
587
He's checking in a day early. Rooms 401 -2-3.
588
Tell Tactical Logistics we're moving them to a standard double on the third floor.
589
They'll need more space than that.
590
The beginning of the end of the end of the beginning has begun. A sad finale played off-key on a broken-down saloon piano in the outskirts of a forgotten ghost town.
591
I'd rather not bear witness to such blasphemy.
592
Me neither.
593
The Grand Budapest has become a troops' barracks.
594
I shall never cross its threshold again in my lifetime.
595
Me neither. Never again shall I...
596
Actually, I think we might be going in there right now after all.
597
Dmitri.
598
Agatha.
599
Good evening, Mr. Desgoffe und Taxis. I'm Monsieur Chuck.
600
We've booked you and your sisters into the King Ferdinand Suite.
601
Good evening. General von Shrecker asked me...
602
Who's that? I beg your pardon?
603
I think that girl's got my picture. Excuse me.
604
Six. Hold it.
605
Six.
606
Compliments of Herr Mendl.
607
Excuse me.
608
Have you seen a pastry girl with a package under her arm in the last minute and a half?
609
Yep. She just got on the elevator with Mr. Desgoffe und Taxis.
610
Thank you.
611
I'm sorry. Who are you?
612
Otto, sir, the new Lobby Boy.
613
You haven't been trained properly.
614
A Lobby Boy never provides information of that kind.
615
You're a stone wall. Understood?
616
Pretty picture.
617
Sixth floor.
618
Where's Boy with Apple?
619
None of your goddamn business!
620
I'm going to blast your candy-ass once and for all right now.
621
Drop your weapon!
622
Cease fire! Cease fire! Whoa!
623
Stop it!
624
Who's shooting who?
625
That's Gustave H! The escaped murderer and art thief.
626
I've got him cornered!
627
That's Dmitri Desgoffe und Taxis!
628
He's responsible for the killing of Deputy Kovacs, Serge X and his club-footed sister, plus his own mother!
629
Nobody move. Everybody's under arrest.
630
Who's out the window?
631
Agatha!
633
Hang on! Here I come!
634
Something's on the back of the...
635
Agatha!
636
Agatha!
637
Are you all right? I think so.
638
Something's on the back of the picture.
639
She left everything to Monsieur Gustave, of course.
640
The mansion, known as Schloss Lutz, the factories, which produced weapons, medicine and textiles, an important newspaper syndicate, and perhaps you've already deduced this very institution, the Grand Budapest Hotel.
641
He anointed me his successor, and as the war continued, I served my adopted country from the narrow desk still found against the wall in the next room.
642
He was the same as his disciples, insecure, vain, superficial, blond, needy. In the end he was even rich.
643
He did not succeed, however, in growing old.
644
"Dearly beloved, we are gathered together...
645
Nor did my darling Agatha.
646
She and our infant son would be killed two years later by the Prussian grippe. An absurd little disease.
647
Today we treat it in a single week, but, in those days many millions died.
648
On the 21st day of the occupation, the morning the independent state of Zubrowka officially ceased to exist, we traveled with Monsieur Gustave to Lutz.
649
In answer to your earlier question, by the way, of course.
650
Zero asked me about my humble beginnings in the hotel trade. I was, perhaps, for a time, considered the best Lobby Boy we'd ever had at the Grand Budapest.
651
I think I can say that.
652
This one finally surpassed me.
653
Although, I must say, he had an exceptional teacher.
654
Truly.
655
"Whence came these two radiant, celestial brothers, "united, for an instant, "as they crossed the stratosphere of our starry window?
656
"One from the East and one from the West."
657
Very good.
658
Don't flirt with her.
659
Why are we stopping at a barley field again?
660
I find these black uniforms very drab.
661
Well, hello there, chaps. We were just talking about you.
662
- Documents, please. - With pleasure, as always.
663
You're the first of the official death squads to whom we've been formally introduced.
664
How do you do?
665
Plus ça change, am I right? Uh, that's a migratory visa with stage three worker status, darling.
666
Read this.
667
Come outside. Now, stay there.
668
I give you my word, if you lay a finger on this man, I'll see you dishonorably discharged, locked up in the stockade and hanged by sundown.
669
There are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity. You filthy, goddamn, pock-marked, fascist assholes!
670
He was one of them.
671
What more is there to say?
672
What happened in the end?
673
In the end they shot him.
674
So it all went to me.
675
After dinner, we went to collect the keys to our rooms, but Monsieur Jean had abandoned his post. I expect he's forgotten all about us.
676
In recent years, of course, such properties and holdings as the Grand Budapest had with very few exceptions become common property.
677
While the precise terms of his negotiation with the new government had never been announced, the result was an open secret, Zero Moustafa had traded a great and important fortune in exchange for one costly, unprofitable, doomed hotel.
678
Why?
679
Was it merely sentimental?
680
It was quite forward of me and a bit out of character, but I felt I must know, for my health, I suppose.
681
Forgive me for asking. I hope I haven't upset you.
682
No, of course not.
683
Is it simply your last connection to that vanished world, his world, if you will?
684
His world?
685
No, I don't think so.
686
You see, we shared a vocation. It wouldn't have been necessary.
687
No. The hotel I keep for Agatha.
688
We were happy here.
689
For a little while.
690
To be frank, I think his world had vanished long before he ever entered it.
691
But, I will say, he certainly sustained the illusion with a marvelous grace.
692
Are you going up? No, I'll sit for a little while.
693
Good night.
694
The next week, I sailed for a cure in South America and began a long, wandering journey abroad.
695
I did not return to Europe for many years.
696
It was an enchanting old ruin.
