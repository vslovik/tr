It is a very common mistake, it is believed that the imagination of a writer is always at work, which constantly inventes thousands of events, of episodes, that create his stories from nothing.

2
In fact, the opposite is true.

3
When people know you are a writer, they bring you stories and characters and as long as you keep your observing and listening skills attentive, these stories will continue to ...

4
Stop it. Stop it! No! Do not do it!

5
They will continue to find you throughout your life.

6
To those who have told other stories, many stories will be told.

7
- Sorry. - It's all OK.

8
The following events have been described exactly as I will present them and in a totally unexpected way.

9
Several years ago, suffering from a mild form of "Writer's Fever", a type of common neurastenia between the Intelligence of Time, I decided to spend the month of August in the spa town of Nebelsbad downstream of the Sudetenwaltz, and I stayed at the Grand Budapest , A picturesque, elaborate and well celebrated hotel.

10
Many of you will have heard of it.

11
It was in the low season, and at that time completely out of fashion, had already begun its decline towards squalor and possible demolition.

12
With the other few guests, we soon came to recognize each other as the only inhabitants of the vast building, although I do not remember there was any other confidences beyond the polite notes of the boss we exchanged encountering in the palm grove in Arab baths and at the funicular .

13
We were a very reserved group, it seemed, and lonely, with no exception.

14
Perhaps precisely because of this general silence, I found a familiar acquaintance with the concierge of the hotel, a Western Noto like Monsieur Jean, whose laziness hit me but, at the same time, great courtesy.

15
Suspicion was not at all well paid.

16
Anyway, one night, as I became conversant with Monsieur Jean, I noticed a new presence in the group. A gentle and old gentleman dressed elegantly with an exceptionally intelligent and lively face and a perceiving aura of sadness.

17
He was sitting alone, like all of us but I must say that he was the only one who really seemed deeply alone.

18
That was also a symptom of my medical condition.

19
Who is that old gentleman? I asked Monsieur Jean.

20
With my astonishment, he was taken aback.

21
- He does not know? - Churches.

22
Do not you recognize him?

23
In fact it seemed familiar to me.

24
Mr. Moustafa is in person.

25
It came this morning.

26
This name will undoubtedly be familiar with the most elated of you.

27
Mr. Zero Moustafa was the richest man in Zubrowka and the owner of the Grand Budapest.

28
Comes often and stays here for a week or more, three times a year, never in high season.

29
Monsieur Jean made me sign and I came near.

30
I'll tell you a secret.

31
It always takes a single and no bath room in a corner of the top floor. It's smaller than the service lift!

32
He was well known, Zero Moustafa had bought and lived in some of the most sumptuous castles and palaces in the continent.

33
Yet here, in his half-empty hotel, was he occupying a dachshund?

34
At that moment, the curtain opened on a domestic drama ... Shit.

35
Which required the immediate and total attention of Monsieur jean, but who, in sincerity, did not capture mine for a long time.

36
Anyway, this intrusion in the story of the strange old man had left me, as it is said, "gespannt wie ein Flitzebogen", that is, on the thorns, and on the thorns I stayed all the following morning, until, in his usual manner of mysterious act And infallible, the fate once again moved to my place.

37
I admire her work.

38
Excuse me?

39
I said I know and admire her wonderful work.

40
Thank you very much, sir.

41
Monsieur Jean felt he would exchange a word or two about the senior owner of this building? I have to admit she asked her. Monsieur Jean is absolutely capable, of course, but one can not say he is a first class concierge, nor in honesty, even second.

42
But it does.

43
Times have changed.

44
The spa baths are really great.

45
Originally they were.

46
Obviously I could not keep them.

47
Too decadent for modern taste.

48
But I love her, too, these lovely old ruins.

49
How did you buy the Hotel, if I can ask?

50
The Grand Budapest.

51
I did not.

52
If you did not just ask for education, and please tell me if this is the case, but if this story seriously interests you, I invite you to dine with me tonight, and it will be my pleasure and honor to tell you "my story." As well as.

53
Two roasted ducks with olives.

54
Rabbit, salad?

55
'52 Poully-Jouvet and a quarter of brut's champagne bottle.

56
This should give us plenty of time - if I hesitate to get started.

57
- Of course.

58
Well, it starts with the predecessor of our common friend.

59
The beloved first concierge of the Grand Budapest.

60
Start with ...

61
- The table near the window. - Yes, Monsieur Gustave.

62
- The tray on the table. - Right away, Monsieur Gustave.

63
There. Those were brushed?

64
- Of course, Monsieur Gustave. - In the hoods.

65
- What about Oberstdorf & Co.?

66
- I think so, Monsieur Gustave.

67
- In the second trunk. Who has the tickets? - I, Monsieur Gustave.

68
Give them to me.

69
They're in order. Wait in the corner.

70
- I will not go anymore.

71
- How, excuse me?

72
- I will not go anymore. - Why not?

73
- I'm scared. - And what?

74
I'm afraid this may be the last time we see you.

75
Why should this be so?

76
Well, I can not explain it in words, but I hear it.

77
Divine goodness, there is no reason to leave if you are so ...

78
- Come with me. - In that lick of Lutz?

79
- Please. - Give me your hand.

80
It has nothing to fear. You're always a little anxious before you leave.

81
I admit that this time you are more than usual.

82
But, honestly ... Oh, Holy Heaven.

83
What did you do to your nails?

84
- How, excuse me? - This naughty nail polish.

85
- The color is completely wrong. - You do not like it?

86
It's not that I do not like it, it repels me physically.

87
- Maybe I know what can relax you. - Thing? No, do not play.

88
- Shh, listen to the words. - Please, not now.

89
"Ramingo, one night in a noble streak of cinereal sparrows of pines, I drifted into a frosty stone, misty rain, diaphanous, the inscription for a long time, almost seemed to be read in the nubile cracks ..."

90
Would you light a candle for me?

91
- In the sacristy of Santa Maria?

92
- I will personally cover myself.

93
Remember, I'll always be at your side.

94
- I love you.

95
- I love you.

96
It is not easy to earn a woman's devotion for 19 consecutive seasons.

97
- Yes, sir.

98
- I'm really fond of you, you know.

99
Yes, sir.

100
But I had never seen her so before.

101
No, sir.

102
It tore like a stitched dog.

103
Very true.

104
Drive to the Cathedral of Santa Maria in Brucknerplatz.

105
Buy a simple, medium length candle And take 4 Kubeck's rest.

106
Light it up in the sacristy, say a short rosary then go to Mendl and take a courtesan au chocolat.

107
If coins are being made, from the kid to the cripple shoeshine.

108
- Right away, sir. - Wait.

109
- Who are you?

110
- I'm Zero, sir. The new Lobby Boy.

111
- Zero, did you say that? - Yes, sir.

112
- I've never seen or heard you call. - Who has hired you?

113
Mr. Mosher, sir. - Mr. Mosher!

114
Yes, Monsieur Gustave?

115
It seems to me that you have clandestinely assumed this young man in the role of Lobby Boy.

116
He was hired for a trial period pending his consent.

117
Maybe yes. Thank you, Mr. Mosher.

118
It's a pleasure, Monsieur Gustave.

119
Now you will be officially interviewed. Do I have to go first to turn on that jar, sir?

120
Thing? No.

121
Experience?

122
Hotel Kinski, garzone, six months.

123
Hotel Berlitz, servant, three months.

124
- Before it was even disheveled ... - Experience: zero.

125
- Thanks again, Monsieur Gustave.

126
- Straighten that cap, Anatole.

127
- Pleasure is mine, Herr Schneider. - The strap is broken.

128
- These are unacceptable. - I totally agree.

129
- Education? - I studied reading and writing.

130
I started elementary schools. I have almost...

131
- Education: zero. - This time it exploded.

132
Good day, Cicero. Call a damned plumber!

133
- This afternoon, Monsieur Gustave?

134
- No doubt, Frau Liebling.

135
- What the hell is this? - Not now.

136
Family?

137
Zero.

138
Sixth, Igor.

139
Why do you want to be a Lobby Boy?

140
Well, who would not want to be at Grand Budapest, sir?

141
It's an institution.

142
Very well.

143
- Mille Klubeck. - My goodness.

144
Have you ever been a Lobby Boy, sir?

145
What do you believe?

146
Well, I guess you should have started somehow ...

147
- Go to turn on that damned crier. - Yes, sir.

148
And so, he started my life.

149
Aspiring Junior Lobby Boy, Grand Budapest Hotel, under the strict command of Monsieur Gustave H.

150
I became his pupil, and he was my guardian and supervisor. What is a Lobby Boy?

151
A Lobby Boy is completely invisible but always under eye. A Lobby Boy remembers what customers hate. A Lobby Boy anticipates customer needs even before they need it.

152
A Lobby Boy is, above all, discreet to the unlikely. Our guests know that their deeper secrets, some of which, frankly, rather inadequate, will bring them with us to the grave. - So keep your mouth shut, Zero. - Yes, sir.

153
It's all for now.

154
I began to realize that many of the hotel's most esteemed and distinguished guests came for him. He seemed to be an essential part of his duties.

155
... But I think it was also a pleasure. The requirements were always the same.

156
They had to be rich, deprived, insecure, vanity, superficial, blond, needy for attention. Why are you blonde?

157
Because they were all. He was, moreover, the most generously fragrant man I ever met. The fragrance announced its arrival far away. And persisted for long minutes when he left. I worked six days a week, half a day on Sunday.

158
Our meals were poor but frequent, to withstand better. Two breakfasts, two lunches and a night meal. Monsieur Gustave also held a daily talk. Rudeness is a mere expression of fear.

159
People are afraid not to get what they want. The most unpleasant and horrible person just needs to be loved, and it will open like a flower.

160
A verse goes with me: "The paintbrush's brush kissed that young niffle" with his agile bristles "and with his pompous sweetness, he restored his empty goats."

161
He consumed his dinner alone in his room.

162
The hotel owner's identity was unknown to us all.

163
Every month his emissary, known as Vice Kovacs, came to check the records and communicate messages on behalf of the mysterious owner.

164
On these occasions, Monsieur Gustave and our trade manager, Herr Becker, met him privately over the Reception.

165
It was then that I met Agatha, but we will not talk about it. - What do you want? - Look.

166
Good God.

167
I'm sorry, sir.

168
- We have to go to her. - We have to?

169
Tout de suite. You need me, and I need you for the bags and so on.

170
- How can you crawl out? - 5 minutes.

171
Just do it. And she puts a bottle of Pouilly-Jouvet in '26 in a bucket of ice with two glasses So there will not be any drink of cat's piss in the carriage restaurant.

172
It's all my fault. He tried to tell me about his premonition. I did not hear it. The whole Lutz will be in mourning, except for his false, demonic children whom he hated and could not bear kissing on his cheek. They will dance like gypsies.

173
Nothing really makes sense in life, since it can end all from one moment to the next ...

174
And immediately afterwards, comes the rigor mortis. Oh, the best always die young.

175
With a little luck, he left some Klubeck to your old friend, but you never know until the ink on the death certificate is dry.

176
It was a bed-bomb, among other things.

177
He was 84, Monsieur Gustave.

178
I had older ones.

179
As young people, they all point to the fillet and the lettuce, but over the years, you have to move on less valuable cuts, which is fine to me because they prefer them. They are more flavorful, or so they say.

180
Why are we stuck in a barley field?

181
Hey, hello, folks. Documents. With pleasure.

182
The photo does not honor me, I'm afraid. I was considered a very nice man.

183
What's the "F" for? Fritz? Franz?

184
- Franz. - I knew it!

185
He's making a grimace.

186
It's a residence permit with a third-tier employee status, my dear Franz.

187
And with me.

188
Come on, please.

189
Wait a minute. Sit down, Zero. His visas are in order.

190
I personally checked them with the Bureau of Labor and Servitude.

191
He can not stop him just because he's a damned immigrant.

192
He did nothing.

193
Stop it, damn it!

194
No matter, Monsieur Gustave! Let them do it!

195
Ow! Ouch!

196
Damned, Dirty, Disgusting Fascist beasts!

197
Keep your hands down from my Lobby Boy!

198
What's the problem?

199
All this is shameful.

200
This young man works for me at the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad.

201
Monsieur Gustave?

202
My name is Henckels.

203
I am the son of Dr. Wolfgang Henckels-Bergersdofer. Do you remember me? I know perfectly well who you are. It's incredible. You are the little Albert. I'm terribly embarrassed. Free them. Free them.

204
Your colleague is stateless. He has to ask for a review of the Special Transit Permit, which at this point could be very difficult to obtain. Take this.

205
It's time-consuming, but I'm afraid it's the maximum I can do. How is her beautiful mother? - Very well, thank you. - I love it. - Greetings warmly. - I will do it.

206
His traveling companion was kind as I was when I was a sad child.

207
My men and I apologize for bothering you. I beg your pardon, sir.

208
See? There are still dull glories of civilization in this wild slaughterhouse that we call humanity.

209
It is exactly what we represent in our humble, insignificant ...

210
Oh, but I'm screaming.

211
Where is Clotilde? Bring me to her. You're so beautiful, my dear. Really. They did a great job.

212
I do not know what products they used there in the morgue, but I also want a little. In sincerity, you are better than it has been in recent years. You seem almost alive.

213
Oh, you changed her in the end. It's perfect. - Clotilde? - Oui, Monsieur Gustave?

214
A glass of cold water, no ice, for pleasure Ah. All right.

215
I will not get much, dear. We escorted through a green cloth door, into a narrow service corridor and into the pantry.

216
An instant later, the kitchen door opened and a minute white dressed robbery glittered. I never forgot the expression on her face. What the hell is going on?

217
I had never set foot in a home like that in my life.

218
I knew very little about the subsequent events.

219
But at some point I knew that when the fate of a great fortune is in the dance, greed goes into the veins like a poison.

220
Uncles, grandchildren, cousins, relatives of ever-weaker relatives. The faraway family of the old woman came out like cockroaches in search of food.

221
At the head of that congregation, incredible coincidence, We found our Vice Kovacs, himself an important notary.

222
He was the executor of the widow's will. This is Madame D.'s will.

223
It consists of a document written before the death of her husband 46 years ago, and 635 amendments, notes, corrections and letters of intent. Added over the next decades.

224
The definitive legitimacy of this collection requires further analysis, but in the view of this office, Madame D's intention was to control the majority of his inheritance being transferred to his son, Dmitri, with special diaries for his sisters , Marguerite, Laetitia and Carolina, giving smaller gifts to several members of the extended family as indicated in the Beneficiaries List, which I will read in due course.

225
Nevertheless. An additional code, which I received by mail only this morning, and without any doubt, sent by Madame D in her last hours of life, contains an amendment to the original certificate, which, as prescribed by law, I will read you now .

226
The authenticity of this document has not yet been confirmed by the competent court, so I ask all parties to be patient and keep the comments until the necessary investigations are completed.

227
"To my esteemed friend who has comforted me in my last years" and brought a ray of sunshine to an old woman's life, "which he believed would never be more happy.

228
"Monsieur Gustave H," I leave in inheritance, net of all taxes "and with full and absolute trusteeship," the painting known as "Boy with apple" ... - Wow! - "... by Johannes van Hoytl ...

229
- I can not believe. - "... son ..." "What?" "That gave both of them so much pleasure."

230
Does van Hoytl? - Esentasse? - But can he do that? Who is Gustave H?

231
I'm afraid I'm dear. That fucking cock! It's a hotel doorkeeper. What's he doing here? I came to bring my homage to a great woman I loved.

232
- This man is an intruder in my house! - It's not yours yet, Dmitri.

233
Missing Authentication, and Donation Act ...

234
You will not have Boy with Apple, damn checca!

235
And how should this make me feel?

236
Call the police. We dispute denunciation.

237
This criminal has afflicted my family for nearly 20 years.

238
He is a ruthless adventurer and a swindler who plagues old, sick and psychic women. And probably if she fucks her too!

239
I go to bed with all my friends. Where's Celine?

240
Thing? She's dead. We are reading his will.

241
Oh, yes, yes, clear.

242
If I find out that you have ever touched my mother's body, alive or dead, I swear to God that I cut my throat? I got it?

243
I thought I'd say I'm a fucking cock. - You are, but you are bisexual. - Let's change subject. I go away.

244
That painting, Boy with Apple, has no price. I got it? Congratulations, Monsieur Gustave!

245
They'll make me a war, you fucking bitch. - It's very beautiful? - Beyond every word.

246
"Finance the Right Bard Can not Sing" That Its Missing And All That Is Not! - "His speech can not ..." - Can I see it? I do not see why not.

247
This is the gorgeous portrait that Van Hoytl makes of a magnificent boy on the brink of maturity. Blond, refined. White skin like milk.

248
Of unmatched origin. One of the last in private hands, and no doubt the best. It's a masterpiece.

249
The rest of the stuff is worthless hooves.

250
What did he want to tell me first? I do not think I can say it now.

251
Write me tomorrow. Lutzbahn Station! I will never separate. She remembered them. She'll remember me. Forever. I will die with this picture over my bed. See the similarity? Oh yes. In fact we should sell it.

252
The sooner is, the better, if they try to steal them in turn. Also, those psychopathic soldiers on the train ...

253
This could be a difficult war and a long lease of the hotel. For what we know, they could shut up tomorrow. Let's make a solemn covenant of blood.

254
We contact the black market and sell Boy with Apple by week, then leave the country and hide somewhere along the Maltese Riviera until the storm is over and we will be able to resume our jobs.

255
In exchange for your help, your loyalty and your service as my personal valet, I promise you 1.5% of the sale price.

256
- Can we not make 10%? - 10%? Do you fool me? It's more than I owe a real art merchant, and you would not distinguish a chiaroscuro from a bunch of chicken meat.

257
No, 1.5 is right. But you can hear me: if I die first, and it will surely be so, you will be my only heir. There is not much in the dish except for a set of ivory brushes and my collection of romantic poetry, but when it is time yours will be all along with everything we do not spend in whiskey and prostitutes. This is our sacred covenant. I redesign it instantly.

258
I, Monsieur Gustave H, relatively capable of understanding, today, October 19, in the year of the Lord 1932 ...

259
He never told me where to come from. I never wondered where his family was. Excuse me.

260
There is the police. They ask for her. Tell them to come right away. Okay.

261
Have you ever been questioned by the authorities? Yes, I was once detained and tortured by rebel militias after the Desert Insurrection.

262
- You know how it works, then. Shut up. - Sure. You have never heard the word "van Hoytl" in your life. Okay, let's go. How can I help you? Ah, Inspector Henckels.

263
"By order of the Police Commissioner of the Zubrowka Province," I am arrested for the murder "by Madame Ceine Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis."

264
I knew there was something suspicious. We did not have the cause of death. She was killed and you believe it was me.

265
Hey!

266
Stop!

267
What happened?

268
My dear Zero has happened, that I made an ass like a whacky freak called Pinky Bandinski who had the daring to question my virility, because if there is one thing that we learned from appendix novels, Is that when you're in a place like this, you never have to be a girl.

269
You have to show yourself up right from the first moment. You have to earn their respect. You should see her growl grumpy. In fact, he became a dear friend. You will know it, I hope.

270
So. Did you talk to Kovacs?

271
I saw him last night, secretly.

272
He made me swear in a Bible that I would not tell anyone.

273
- You must do it too. - I'll do it later.

274
- You suspect you're innocent. - Obviously.

275
What is the charge?

276
At the small hours of the evening of October 19th,

277
A man known as Monsieur Gustave H, came to the residence of the Desgoffe und Taxis in Lutz and entered the service door without being seen by anyone,

278
Proceeding for the service staircase and the hallway of the servitude, he entered the private rooms of Madame D. There is no evidence to indicate whether the visit was agreed with her or not.

279
The following morning, Madame D was found dead for stinging poisoning. Monsieur Gustave was no longer seen in the building until 24 hours later.

280
The identity of the accusers is explicit in the documents filed.

281
These include, essentially, all members of the extended family, but the key witness, who seems to have seen the alleged events, seems to have left jurisdiction. Its position is unknown at the moment, but the competent authorities continue to search.

282
Who is it?

283
- Serge? - I'm afraid of that.

284
That bastard.

285
No I do not believe it. They forced him. I've been in a viper's nest. Do you have an alibi?

286
Sure, but he is married to the Duke of Westphalia.

287
I can not allow her name to be contaminated by these dirty business.

288
- It's a matter of life or death. - I know, but that bastard if it is shaken.

289
He is already aboard Queen Nasstasja, towards the Dutch Tanganyka. Not soft.

290
The details of the conspiracy, now of public dominance, were at times unpredictable for us. I am looking for Serge X, a man at the service of my employers, the Desgoffe und Taxis family of Schloss Lutz.

291
- Yes, sir? - And his sister?

292
- Yes, sir. - Have you seen him recently?

293
- No, sir. - Nossignore?

294
- No, yes.

295
I have to find it as soon as possible, for her and everyone else's good.

296
If you see ...

297
- Yes, sir? - Tell him that Jopling said,

298
"Back home."

299
But one thing was certain, Desfogge und Taxis were a very powerful family, and time was not for our benefit.

300
A letter from Monsieur Gustave. Zero.

301
- You want me ... - Read it.

302
"My dear and trusted colleagues ..."

303
I miss you while I write you from the chains of my unpleasant and mindless imprisonment.

304
Until I am again free to be among you, Grand Budapest is in your hands, as well as its impeccable reputation.

305
Immaculate and honored mantle.

306
Be cautious of his tiniest piece as if you were looking from above like a hawk with a whip between claws, because that's what I do.

307
I must find a lack of any kind during my absence, I swear that justice will fall on you, quick and ruthless. A great and noble house has been placed under your protection. Tell Zero any strangeness.

308
"Your devout Monsieur Gustave."

309
Then there is a poem, but maybe it's best to start the soup since there are 46 verses.

310
"A rude black ash insects the deer of a rat's dagger" and mixes with dense effusions of marbling wood "while the chanting of a troglodyte ..."

311
I never trusted that butler.

312
- It's too honest. - Too honest, you say?

313
Well, as it is, I find it quickly and solve it.

314
Can I offer you a soup dish?

315
No? Nobody?

316
You, with the big scar on your face?

317
Try it. It is very warm and nutritious this evening. It takes a pinch of salt. Good day.

318
Mushroom, gentlemen? Who wants it?

319
I say good. It's time to get up, hop, hop. Good morning, Pinky.

320
- Again, Mendl? - That's right.

321
Who has the cutter blade? - On another planet. - Mendl is the best.

322
- Well, at work. - Monsieur Gustave? Yup?

323
I and the guys discussed it. We believe you are a really good guy. Well, I've never been blamed for so much, but I appreciate the intention.

324
She is one of us now. What a nice thing to say. Thank you, dear Pinky. Thank you, Gunther. Thank you, Wolf. Anything else? Tell him, Ludwig.

325
The Checkpoint 19 is not a two-money gang. There are thick iron bars at each door, vent and window. There are 72 guards on the plane, and another 16 in the towers. There is a 100-meter jump in a moat full of crocodiles. But like all prisons, it has a weak point, which in this case has the shape of a sewerage system constructed at the time of the first fortification of this fort in the distant Middle Ages.

326
Now, no one says it's a walk along a tree-lined avenue with an elegant woman and a white poodle, but it's what's called "vulnerability," and this is our daily bread.

327
Look. Who designed it? What do you mean? I designed it.

328
Beautiful, you have a wonderful trait, Ludwig. You have a huge artistic talent. Question: How do you intend to penetrate these foundations? They are 60cm reinforced granite masonry, right? Digging with the cutter blade, I guess it takes us three to six months of continuous engagement, during which many of our members will be violently executed.

329
He hit the sign, Mr. Gustave. We have fake documents, second-hand civilian clothes, a rope ladder made with staves and sheets, but we need digging tools, which are hard to find in this crap. At this point in the story, the Man was suddenly silent and removed his lambskin shoulder.

330
His eyes darkened like a stormy sky. It was obviously difficult.

331
- Are you okay, Mr. Moustafa? - I decided to ask him. - No, my dear, at all. - He answered.

332
It's just that I do not know how to go on. He was crying.

333
You see, I never talk about Agatha, because only the thought of her name loses control of my emotions. Well, I guess it's useless to turn around.

334
You see, she saved us. On the day of our third appointment, I asked her hand, and she agreed.

335
- Do you want to marry me? - Yup.

336
We did not even have 50 Klubeck in two. Nobody knew, of course, but who would it be? We were both all alone in the world, and we were madly in love.

337
- Here it is. - Thank you. - It's a book. - I see.

338
Romantic Poetry, Volume I. Recommended by Monsieur Gustave. I also have a copy of it. - I ruined the surprise, I imagine. - I'll open it anyway. Read the dedication.

339
Monsieur Gustave kept us in an immediate and scrupulous cross-examination.

340
Is enchanting. Absolutely lovely. ... during which she gave Agatha a porcelain pendant and five dozen white tulips in a box of the size of a baby coffin.

341
- He does not feel good. - How, excuse me?

342
Why is he jealous? She is my girlfriend. She can not give her gifts. I'm just asking a few questions about this delightful view on your own.

343
Never be jealous, Zero, not even for a moment. Are you trying with us?

344
- Yes. - I approve this union.

345
Agatha, honey, come back to your beloved. Soon we discovered ...

346
I wish you all the good. That Agatha was not just phenomenal with the dough spatula and the cream seals ...

347
- Mendl. - Go.

348
But that was also incredibly brave.

349
I think we were born. Something is missing. A crucial, lost or most likely destroyed document- I do not know what it is, I do not know what it represents, I do not know what it is, but there are traces everywhere.

350
Now, I do not want to alarm her, and I'm not looking to see significant changes in the magistrates' decisions about her legacy, but above all given the circumstances of her death, and the disappearance of the key witness of the murder, Serge X. I suggest bringing this Case to the attention of the municipal inspector so that there is no doubt in the future about the legitimacy of the verdict.

351
- Agree? - Do not agree. - Do not agree? - Do not agree. - May I ask you a question, Vilmos? - Of course, Dmitri. - Who do you work for? - How do you say? Who do you work for? I thought you were our lawyer. Well, technically I'm the performer of the will.

352
In this situation, I represent the deceased. Oh yes? Yes. Payment for my services was included in ... Put things in place and do not create problems, okay?

353
I'm a notary. I am obliged to act according to law. Do not agree. This thing stinks, sisters. Did my cat knock out the window? I do not think so. - No, did not you do it? - Who, Jopling? Okay.

354
There's something I did not tell you, Agatha. - Okay. - We stole a picture. It is very precious, perhaps 5 million of Klubeck, in fact. I do not know if they have noticed theft but if something happens to me ... Rubi's artwork?

355
Just one picture. However, we must have a plan for your survival. Keep this. It's code and you will need a lens to read it, it's written exactly where and how to find Boy with Apple. Do not accept less than half the sale price. Furthermore...

356
- Zero, I'm a fornaia. - You're a baker. I'm not a recipe, that's the point. I do not sell stolen items. I said that badly. She wanted him to have him. Go to sleep. Yes, Herr Mendl.

357
- Keep it. - No.

358
Okay, but take the same. The following day, Herr Becker received a strange news last hour from the office of Vice Kovacs, who sent the planned appointment forever.

359
Let's get out.

360
- What are you doing out there? - Close that sewer.

361
These are here trying to run away.

362
What the hell is that gonna do to you, a wicked spy?

363
Guards! Guards!

364
It is you. Thank you.

365
Thanks, gentle, kind friend.

366
Okay.

367
I think you can call a draw.

368
Good evening.

369
Let me present you. Pinky, Wolf, Ludwig, this is the divine Zero.

370
Gunther was killed in the catacombs.

371
Well, guys, who knows when we will meet again, but if one day ...

372
Wait.

373
There is no time for the talk.

374
Take care of her, Mr. Gustave.

375
Good luck, boy.

376
- Where is the refuge? - I did not find it.

377
No shelter? Seriously? Are we alone out here?

378
I'm afraid of yes. I asked around, but ...

379
I see. Too risky. I guess we'll have to improvise.

380
Let's put on the disguises.

381
- We already have them. - Not at all.

382
He had said, fake mustache, fake beard, and so on.

383
- Did not you bring anything? - I thought you would have grown up.

384
And it would not have seemed realistic, right?

385
When they are done well, they are perfectly convincing.

386
But I understand. That's right.

387
Give me some Air de Panache spray, please.

388
- Can I have a splash? - I forgot the Air de Panache.

389
Have you really forgot the Air de Panache?

390
Do not believe it, how could you?

391
I've been in jail, Zero! Can you imagine how humiliating it is?

392
Puzzo.

393
Wonderful, right?

394
I guess I can not wait for better ... where are you from?

395
- Salim al-Jabat. - That's right.

396
I guess I can not wait for better at Salim al-Jabat where the most precious personal belongings are a stack of dusty carpets and a hungry goat hungry, and sleeping under a tent trying to survive the scenes.

397
But that's not how I trained you.

398
What demon possessed you by persuading you to leave the land that you so obviously have and to walk unusual distances to become a dead immigrant starving in a cultivated and refined society that in all honesty could quietly do without you?

399
War.

400
How do you say?

401
Well, you see, my dad was murdered and the rest of my family executed by a platoon. Our village was razed to the ground and the survivors were forced to flee.

402
I left because of the war.

403
I see. So you're more of a political refugee, right?

404
Right.

405
Well, I suppose I have to keep up everything I said. What stupid idiot I am. A pathetic idiot.

406
God, that selfish bastard.

407
This is shameful, and is well below the standards of Grand Budapest. I apologize for the name of the hotel.

408
It is not his fault. He was just angry because I forgot the perfume. It's not a justification. I need you to live.

409
You are a dear and protected friend and I am proud of you.

410
You have to keep it in mind.

411
I'm desolate, Zero.

412
We are brothers.

413
How is our dear Agatha?

414
"It was at the dawn that you had your semblance in the moon," and then I returned to every dawn, mesmerized, "by the vice that was on my chest, for ever ..."

415
Very well. I stop here because the alarm is ringing, but remember where you came because I would insist that you continue later.

416
I want block posts at every intersection within 50km.

417
Block trains at each station within 100km.

418
I want 50 men and 10 hounds ready in 5 minutes. Let us perceive every Pretzel-Haus, Waffel-hut, Biergarten and above all every Grand Hotel from Augenzburg to Zilchbrock.

419
Those men are dangerous professional criminals. Or at least three of them.

420
Who are you?

421
What's he doing here? Civilians are forbidden access to cells. - This is a military investigation. - It's Mr. Jopling, sir. The mother of her employer was one of the victims ...

422
Hush.

423
Desgoffe und Taxis family jobs?

424
Are you aware of the murder of Vice Vilmos Kovacs on October 23?

425
I am aware of his disappearance.

426
His corpse was found in a sarcophagus behind a litter box at the late-night Kunstmuseum.

427
She missed four fingers.

428
- What do you know about this? - Anything.

429
Scare Mr. Jopling out of the building.

430
Mendl.

431
Central Station, I walk to the Excelsion Palace in Baden-Jurgen, called at the recipient's expense.

432
We have no choice. We can not do anything else.

433
Wait, thank you.

434
It was not our only hope, I would not even have to tell you about her existence.

435
It is understood that you will never have to talk to a living soul.

436
- Jury? - Sure. But what is it?

437
I can not tell you.

438
How do you find two front row armchairs in the gallery for a first at the Tuscan Opera with one day notice?

439
How do you arrange a private viewing of the tapestry collection at the Royal Saxon Gallery?

440
How do you book a corner table at Chez Dominique on Thursday night?

441
Ivan, dear, are Gustave.

442
Well, I was up to about 5 minutes ago.

443
We took the responsibility to go away earlier, if so.

444
Well, through the sewers. Exactly.

445
Listen, Ivan, I'm sorry to interrupt it, but we're in trouble.

446
It's an official request.

447
I formally request the services of the ...

448
The call, Gustave.

449
Good. Attendia

450
Do you forgive me. Do you prefer to go on foot?

451
We are here. It's very simple.

452
Down on the ledge, then on the left.

453
Jojo, accompany the gentleman to the door.

454
Take me to Monsieur Georges of Chateau Luxe, please.

455
Up, damn it, higher up!

456
Go on.

457
- Monsieur Georges. - Above.

458
I see. Immediately.

459
I take Monsieur Robin from Hotel Côte du Cap, please. ... two and three.

460
Monsieur Robin. There is a call for her by Monsieur Dino.

461
Go on.

462
- One, two and three. - Yes, Dino.

463
Yes, Dino. Okay, Dino.

464
I walk Monsieur Martin of the Ritz Imperial, please.

465
Too much salt.

466
Too little pepper.

467
Go on.

468
- Robin? I'm Martin. - Too much salt.

469
I heard it, yes.

470
Maybe. I make some calls.

471
Serge X, gone. Vice Kovacs, he also disappeared.

472
Madame D, dead. Boy with Apple, stolen, from us.

473
Dmitry and Jopling, barbaric ruthless unscrupulous.

474
Gustave H, latitante. What else?

475
- Zero, confused. - Zero, confused, of course.

476
The plot wraps up, as they say.

477
Why, then? Is it a forest metaphor?

478
I do not know.

479
Revenue.

480
We found the butler.

481
It is hidden on the remote slope at Gabelmeister Peak.

482
Our contact has convinced her to meet you tomorrow at noon.

483
At the observatory on the top.

484
Do not tell anyone. It will explain everything to you.

485
Your train starts in 4 and a half minutes.

486
Here are the tickets.

487
- Third class? - She was overcrowded

488
But the ticket was sommelier to Old Versailles.

489
He advised you.

490
You will need these for the carriage wagon.

491
One last thing.

492
The Air de Penache.

493
They only had it half an ounce.

494
We have to offer him something like symbolic gesture.

495
- How much money do you have? - 42 Klubeck and 3 stamps.

496
Dame 25. Su.

497
- Thanks a lot. - Please.

498
- I have to admit it was good. - Jesus Christ.

499
I did not expect it. Well, what do you want me to do now?

500
Talk to your sister again, and you're convincing this time.

501
Damn son of a bitch.

502
Christ on the Cross!

503
What the fuck does that mean?

504
Boy with Apple? I thought I had hidden it.

505
- Why do you only notice it now? - I thought I was looking at an expert.

506
Are you taking me for the ass?

507
I think it was taken by Monsieur Gustave.

508
I'm not angry with Serge.

509
You can not take it with someone for the total lack of moral fiber.

510
He is a small, scary, cowardly coward.

511
- It's not your fault, right? - I do not know. It depends.

512
Well, you can say anything.

513
"It depends". Of course it depends.

514
"Of course that depends," of course it depends.

515
Yes, I think you are right. Obviously it depends.

516
This does not mean I will not pull out that small sewage mud.

517
Anyway, can I marry you? Celebrate the wedding?

518
With pleasure.

519
I must say that I find that girl absolutely delicious.

520
Plain like a table, with that huge Mexico-like desire on his face, to sweat for hours and hours in that daring cooking, while Mendl, by genius, hangs over her like a clumsy gorilla. Yet without a doubt, without a subject of error, you are always and incredibly delightful.

521
Because?

522
For its purity.

523
She admires her, too, Monsieur Gustave.

524
- Really? - Very.

525
It's a good sign, you know. It means he understands it.

526
It's important.

527
Do not try it with her. A telegram was personally delivered to the girl at 4. The envelope was close to the corpse, but the contents were not there.

528
In any case, the telegraphic office holds a copy of the tapes for 24 hours. I copied it, and here it is: "Do the suitcases, stop.

529
"Be ready to go at any time, stop." The hideout is at Gabelmeister Peak, stop. "Destroy this message, with affection, stop."

530
Where's the basket? Why, from this point, sir? Wake? Going to the sled? Climbs?

531
By express courier, I wrote to Agatha telling her to reach us at our hiding place. A Gypsy field somewhat out of Nebelsbad, while I and Monsieur Gustave continued east through the Zubrowkian Alps, Towards our high-ranking randez-vous with Serge X Butler. For precaution, we dropped the hidden train to the freighter just outside from the station.

532
Air de Penache.

533
Great panorama. I must grant it, for what it is.

534
I agree. "It is often remarked as a nerve-wise biocoholic -" even in its most extreme and perfect shape ... "- Somebody arrives.

535
Is she Monsieur Gustave of the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad?

536
Enter the next cable car.

537
Is she Monsieur Gustave of the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad?

538
Change place with me.

539
Is she Monsieur Gustave of the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad?

540
Wear these and sing.

541
- She is Monsieur Gustave of ... - Yes, damn it.

542
Confess.

543
I'm innocent.

544
Eh? No, no.

545
Forgive me, Monsieur Gustave, I did not want to betray her.

546
They threatened me with death and now they murdered my only family. No. Who killed this time?

547
- My lovely sister. - The girl with the wooden leg?

548
- Yeah. - Damned bastards!

549
I tried to warn you at the beginning.

550
I know, my friend. Let's all go.

551
Listen, I hate making it difficult, but I just have to ask her to rehabilitate me.

552
- Obviously it's mourning, but ... - There's more. - In this story. - I understand, go ahead.

553
I have been an official witness, in the presence of Madame D of the drafting of a second testament to be taken into account only in case of violent death.

554
- A second will? - That's right. - If it was done out. - That's right.

555
- IS...? - But they destroyed it.

556
- Oh no. - However...

557
- Yup...? - I printed a copy. A second copy of the second will?

558
- That's right. - IS...?

559
What does he say? Where? What the hell are we talking about?

560
Do not hold us on the thorns. This is a fucking nightmare.

561
Tell us what the fuck is going on!

562
Serge? Serge? Serge!

563
Hell devils. They strangled him, poor man.

564
Soon! Come on!

565
- What do we do if we take it? - I have no idea.

566
He's a psychopathic assassin. Let's stop.

567
I can not. I can barely steer.

568
Pathetic, viscous worm. I hate you.

569
'' Well, if this is done, it must be my end, either! ' The piercer was wandering, "while the archibugs were thundering and the beers roared for pleasure. "As the bastions ruined." "I think I have swallowed my last lazy," he said ... "

570
My goodness! You fucked her!

571
Well done, Zero!

572
Gustave H! She escaped and escaped justice!

573
You deliver and I will personally guarantee that it will be handled fairly.

574
Do not try to escape yet!

575
- What do you think? - I do not know.

576
I would lend myself in the strait seat sitting rather than going to jail.

577
Proposal: We steer the bike to the maniac, recuperate Agatha, we resume Boy with Apple and away on the Maltese Riviera.

578
Perfect! You're extraordinary, Zero. Thank you.

579
A moment of silence for a devoted servant brutally killed during the exercise of his duties. Hi, Serge.

580
OK let's go.

581
The war started at midnight.

582
Pfeifelstadt fell to lunch time, under bombing, and 10 battalions overthrew the western border. The supreme command came to Nebelsbad.

583
Herr Mendl's tribute to the executive staff.

584
General Stieglitz wants a room overlooking the garden and closet.

585
Put it in Suite Duca Leopoldo.

586
Secretary Woroniecki's office was wired.

587
It arrives one day earlier than expected. Rooms 401, 402 and 403.

588
Tell the tactical department that we move them to a double on the third floor.

589
They will need more space for them.

590
The beginning of the end of the end of the beginning begins. A "Gran Finale" gram-toned on a forgotten piano in a saloon on the edge of a forgotten ghost town.

591
I will not bear witness to this blasphemy.

592
Neither do I.

593
The Grand Budapest became a military camp.

594
I will never cross my door throughout my life.

595
- Neither do I. - Never again will I pied ...

596
Actually, I think we might be coming in now, after all.

597
Dmitri.

598
Agatha.

599
Good evening, Mr. Desgoffe und Taxis. I'm Monsieur Chuck.

600
We arranged her and her sisters in the King Ferdinand Suite.

601
Good evening. General von Shrecker asked me to ...

602
- Who is that? - How do you excuse me?

603
I think that girl has the picture. Excuse me.

604
- Sixth. - Wait.

605
Sixth.

606
Gifts by Herr Mendl.

607
I apologize.

608
Have you seen a bun with a pack under his arm in the last minute and a half?

609
Yes. He has just entered the elevator with Mr. Desgoffe und Taxis.

610
Thank you.

611
I'm sorry. Who are you?

612
- Eight, sir, the new Lobby Boy.

613
- You have not been well trained.

614
A Lobby Boy never gives such information.

615
You're a stone wall. Clear?

616
Nice picture.

617
Sixth floor.

618
Where is Boy with Apple?

619
I'm not your affair!

620
I'll blow your ass off your ass once and for all.

621
Put the gun down!

622
Cease-fire! Cease-fire!

623
Stop it!

624
Who is shooting who?

625
That's Gustave H! Fugitive assassin and art thief.

626
I trapped it!

627
That's Dmitri Desgoffe und Taxis!

628
Responsible for the murders of Vice Kovacs, Serge X and her sister-in-law, and her own mother!

629
Nobody moves. You are all in stopping.

630
Who's out at the window?

631
Agatha!

633
Hold on! Arrival!

634
There is something behind the ...

635
Agatha!

636
Agatha!

637
- Are you OK? - I think so.

638
There is something behind the picture.

639
He had left everything to Monsieur Gustave, of course.

640
The magician, named after Schloss Lutz, the factories that produced weapons, medicines and fabrics, an important trade union newspaper, and perhaps the establishment, the Grand Budapest Hotel, has already arrived.

641
He named me his successor, and for the duration of the war I served my dormant dormitory behind the desk still in the room next to him.

642
It was just like her friends: insecure, vanity, superficial, blond, needing attention. In the end it was also rich.

643
But he did not succeed in becoming deceased.

644
Dear friends, we are here together ...

645
Neither did my dear Agatha.

646
You and our baby would be killed two years later by Prussian influence. A disease from nowhere.

647
Today we care about it in a week, but at that time millions of victims died.

648
On the morning of the 21st day of employment, Zubrowka's independent state officially ceased to exist. We moved to Lutz with Monsieur Gustave.

649
Anyway, to answer your first question, of course.

650
Zero asked me about my humble origins in the hotel industry. I've been, for a period considered, the best Lobby Boy I've ever worked at Grand Budapest.

651
I think I can say that.

652
This one has finally overtaken me.

653
Although, I must say, he had an outstanding master.

654
Very true.

655
"Where do these two light-hearted flames," joined for a moment, "in the melting of the stratosphere of our star-shaped twigs, proceed?

656
"One from the east, the other from west."

657
Very well.

658
Do not try it with her.

659
Why are we still standing on a barley field?

660
I find these black uniforms rather slimy.

661
Well, hello, people. We talked just about you.

662
- Documents. - With pleasure, as always.

663
You are the first member of death squads to which I am officially presented.

664
How do you go?

665
Plus what change, am I saying good? [The French saying: the more you change the more you stay the same] It is a residence permit with the status of third-party employee, my dear,

666
Read this.

667
- Bait. - Stay there.

668
I'll give you my word, if he touches this man with a finger, I'll see her dismissed with disgrace, bound to the fence and hanged before sunset.

669
There are still dull glories of civilization in this wild slaughterhouse we call humanity. Damned, Dirty, Disgusting Fascist beasts!

670
He was one of those.

671
What can I say more?

672
How's it over?

673
It's over when they shot him.

674
So everything went to me.

675
After dinner, we went to pick up the keys to our rooms, but Monsieur Jean was not in place. I guess he forgot about us.

676
Obviously, in recent years, properties such as the Grand Budapest have become, with very few exceptions, public goods.

677
Although the exact terms of the contract with the new government have never been made public, the outcome is obvious to all: Zero Moustafa has poured a huge fortune in exchange for a costly, unprofitable, decadent hotel.

678
Because?

679
A mere matter of sentimentality?

680
It was not from me, it was not at all, but I felt I had to know, For my health, I believe.

681
Forgive me if I asked her. I hope I have not offended her.

682
