<seg id="1"> It is an extremely common mistake, people think the writer's imagination is always at work, that he's constantly inventing an endless supply of incidents and episodes, that he simply dreams up his stories out of thin air. </seg>
<seg id="2"> In point of fact, the opposite is true. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Once the public knows you're a writer, they bring the characters and events to you and as long as you maintain your ability to look and to carefully listen, these stories will continue to... </seg>
<seg id="4"> Stop it. Stop it! Don't! Don't do it! </seg>
<seg id="5"> Uh, will continue to seek you out over your lifetime. </seg>
<seg id="6"> To him who has often told the tales of others, many tales will be told. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Sorry. It's all right. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The incidents that follow were described to me exactly as I present them here and in a wholly unexpected way. </seg>
<seg id="9"> A number of years ago, while suffering from a mild case of "Scribe's Fever," a form of neurasthenia common among the intelligentsia of that time, I decided to spend the month of August in the spa town of Nebelsbad below the Alpine Sudetenwaltz, and had taken up rooms in the Grand Budapest, a picturesque, elaborate, and once widely celebrated establishment. </seg>
<seg id="10"> I expect some of you will know it. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It was off season and, by that time, decidedly out of fashion, and it had already begun its descent into shabbiness and eventual demolition. </seg>
<seg id="12"> What few guests we were had quickly come to recognize one another by sight as the only living souls residing in the vast establishment, although I do not believe any acquaintance among our number had proceeded beyond the polite nods we exchanged as we passed in the Palm Court, in the Arabian baths, and on board the Colonnade Funicular. </seg>
<seg id="13"> We were a very reserved group, it seemed, and, without exception, solitary. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Perhaps as a result of this general silence, I had established a casual and bantering familiarity with the hotel's concierge, a West-continental known only as Monsieur Jean, who struck one as being, at once, both lazy and, really, quite accommodating. </seg>
<seg id="15"> I expect he was not well paid. </seg>
<seg id="16"> In any case, one evening, as I stood conferring elbow-to-elbow with Monsieur Jean, as had become my habit, I noticed a new presence in our company. A small, elderly man, smartly dressed, with an exceptionally lively, intelligent face and an immediately perceptible air of sadness. </seg>
<seg id="17"> He was, like the rest of us, alone, but also, I must say, he was the first that struck one as being deeply and truly lonely. </seg>
<seg id="18"> A symptom of my own medical condition as well. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Who's this interesting old fellow? I inquired of Monsieur Jean. </seg>
<seg id="20"> To my surprise, he was distinctly taken aback. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Don't you know? He asked. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Don't you recognize him? </seg>
<seg id="23"> He did look familiar. </seg>
<seg id="24"> That's Mr. Moustafa himself. </seg>
<seg id="25"> He arrived earlier this morning. </seg>
<seg id="26"> This name will no doubt be familiar to the more seasoned persons among you. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Mr. Zero Moustafa was at one time the richest man in Zubrowka, and was still indeed the owner of the Grand Budapest. </seg>
<seg id="28"> He often comes and stays a week or more, three times a year at least, but never in the season. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Monsieur Jean signaled to me and I leaned closer. </seg>
<seg id="30"> I'll tell you a secret. </seg>
<seg id="31"> He takes only a single-bed sleeping room without a bath in the rear corner of the top floor and it's smaller than the service elevator! </seg>
<seg id="32"> It was well known, Zero Moustafa had purchased and famously inhabited some of the most lavish castles and palazzos on the continent. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Yet here, in his own nearly empty hotel, he occupied a servant's quarters? </seg>
<seg id="34"> At that moment, the curtain rose on a parenthetical, domestic drama... Shit. </seg>
<seg id="35"> ...which required the immediate and complete attention of Monsieur Jean, but, frankly, did not hold mine for long. </seg>
<seg id="36"> However, this premature intermission in the story of the curious, old man had left me, as the expression goes, "gespannt wie ein Flitzebogen," that is, on the edge of my seat, where I remained throughout the next morning, until, in what I have found to be its mysterious and utterly reliable fashion, fate, once again, intervened on my behalf. </seg>
<seg id="37"> I admire your work. </seg>
<seg id="38"> I beg your pardon? </seg>
<seg id="39"> I said, I know and admire your wonderful work. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Thank you most kindly, sir. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Did Monsieur Jean have a word or two to share with you about the aged proprietor of this establishment? I must confess, I did myself inquire about you. He's perfectly capable, of course, Monsieur Jean but we can't claim he's a first, or, in earnest, even second-rate concierge. </seg>
<seg id="42"> But there it is. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Times have changed. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The thermal baths are very beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="45"> They were in their first condition. </seg>
<seg id="46"> It couldn't be maintained, of course. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Too decadent for current tastes. </seg>
<seg id="48"> But I love it all just the same, this enchanting old ruin. </seg>
<seg id="49"> How did you come to buy it, if I may ask? </seg>
<seg id="50"> The Grand Budapest. </seg>
<seg id="51"> I didn't. </seg>
<seg id="52"> If you're not merely being polite, and you must tell me if that's the case, but if it genuinely does interest you, may I invite you to dine with me tonight, and it will be my pleasure and, indeed, my privilege to tell you "my story." Such as it is. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Two ducks roasted with olives. </seg>
<seg id="54"> Rabbit, salad? </seg>
<seg id="55"> Pouilly-Jouvet '52, plus a split of the brut. </seg>
<seg id="56"> That should provide us ample time if I commence promptly. </seg>
<seg id="57"> By all means. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Well, it begins, as it must, with our mutual friend's predecessor. </seg>
<seg id="59"> The beloved, original concierge of The Grand Budapest. </seg>
<seg id="60"> It begins, of course, with... </seg>
<seg id="61"> - Bring the table to the window. - Yes, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="62"> - Bring the tray to the table. - Right away, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="63"> Right there. Have those been brushed and blocked? </seg>
<seg id="64"> Of course, Monsieur Gustave. Pack them in the hat boxes. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Is that from Oberstdorf & Company? </seg>
<seg id="66"> I believe so, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="67"> Second trunk. Who has the tickets? I do, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Give them to me. </seg>
<seg id="69"> These are in order. Wait in the corner. </seg>
<seg id="70"> - I'm not leaving. </seg>
<seg id="71"> - I beg your pardon? </seg>
<seg id="72"> - I'm not leaving. - Why not? </seg>
<seg id="73"> - I'm frightened. - Of what? </seg>
<seg id="74"> I fear this may be the last time we ever see each other. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Why on earth would that be the case? </seg>
<seg id="76"> Well, I can't put it into words, but I feel it. </seg>
<seg id="77"> For goodness sake, there's no reason for you to leave us if you'd... </seg>
<seg id="78"> - Come with me. - To fucking Lutz? </seg>
<seg id="79"> - Please. - Give me your hand. </seg>
<seg id="80"> You've nothing to fear. You're always anxious before you travel. </seg>
<seg id="81"> I admit, you appear to be suffering a more acute attack on this occasion. </seg>
<seg id="82"> But, truly and honestly... Oh, dear God. </seg>
<seg id="83"> What have you done to your fingernails? </seg>
<seg id="84"> - I beg your pardon? - This diabolical varnish. </seg>
<seg id="85"> - The color is completely wrong. - Don't you like it? </seg>
<seg id="86"> It's not that I don't like it. I am physically repulsed. </seg>
<seg id="87"> - Perhaps this will soothe you. - What? Don't recite. </seg>
<seg id="88"> Just listen to the words. Hush. Please. Not now. </seg>
<seg id="89"> "While questing once in noble wood of gray, medieval pine, I came upon a tomb, rain-slick'd, rubbed-cool, ethereal, 'its inscription long-vanished, yet still within its melancholy fissures..." </seg>
<seg id="90"> Will you light a candle for me, please? </seg>
<seg id="91"> - In the sacristy of Santa Maria? </seg>
<seg id="92"> - I'll see to it myself immediately. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Remember, I'm always with you. </seg>
<seg id="94"> I love you. </seg>
<seg id="95"> I love you. </seg>
<seg id="96"> It's quite a thing winning the loyalty of a woman like that for 19 consecutive seasons. </seg>
<seg id="97"> Um... Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="98"> She's very fond of me, you know. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="100"> But I've never seen her like that before. </seg>
<seg id="101"> No, sir. </seg>
<seg id="102"> She was shaking like a shitting dog. </seg>
<seg id="103"> Truly. </seg>
<seg id="104"> Run to the cathedral of Santa Maria in Brucknerplatz. </seg>
<seg id="105"> Buy one of the plain, half-length candles and take back four Klubecks in change. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Light it in the sacristy, say a brief rosary then go to Mendl's and get me a courtesan au chocolat. </seg>
<seg id="107"> If there's any money left, give it to the crippled shoe-shine boy. </seg>
<seg id="108"> - Right away, sir. - Hold it. </seg>
<seg id="109"> - Who are you? </seg>
<seg id="110"> - I'm Zero, sir. The new Lobby Boy. </seg>
<seg id="111"> - Zero, you say? - Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="112"> - I've never heard of you, never laid eyes on you. - Who hired you? </seg>
<seg id="113"> - Mr. Mosher, sir. - Mr. Mosher! </seg>
<seg id="114"> Yes, Monsieur Gustave? </seg>
<seg id="115"> Am I to understand you've surreptitiously hired this young man in the position of a Lobby Boy? </seg>
<seg id="116"> He's been engaged for a trial period, pending your approval. </seg>
<seg id="117"> Perhaps, yes. Thank you, Mr. Mosher. </seg>
<seg id="118"> You're most welcome, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="119"> You're now going to be officially interviewed. Should I go and light the candle first, sir? </seg>
<seg id="120"> What? No. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Experience? </seg>
<seg id="122"> Hotel Kinski, Kitchen Boy, six months. </seg>
<seg id="123"> Hotel Berlitz, Mop and Broom Boy, three months. </seg>
<seg id="124"> - Before that I was a Skillet Scrubber... - Experience, zero. </seg>
<seg id="125"> - Thank you again, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="126"> - Straighten that cap, Anatole. </seg>
<seg id="127"> - The pleasure's mine, Herr Schneider. - The strap's busted. </seg>
<seg id="128"> - These are not acceptable. - I fully agree. </seg>
<seg id="129"> - Education? - I studied reading and spelling. </seg>
<seg id="130"> I started my primary school. I almost... </seg>
<seg id="131"> - Education, zero. - Now it's exploded. </seg>
<seg id="132"> Good morning, Cicero. Call the goddamn plumber! </seg>
<seg id="133"> This afternoon, Monsieur Gustave? </seg>
<seg id="134"> - Without fail, Frau Liebling. </seg>
<seg id="135"> - What in hell is this? Not now. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Family? </seg>
<seg id="137"> Zero. </seg>
<seg id="138"> Six, Igor. </seg>
<seg id="139"> Why do you want to be a Lobby Boy? </seg>
<seg id="140"> Well, who wouldn't, at the Grand Budapest, sir? </seg>
<seg id="141"> It's an institution. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Very good. </seg>
<seg id="143"> - A thousand Klubecks. - My goodness. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Were you ever a Lobby Boy, sir? </seg>
<seg id="145"> What do you think? </seg>
<seg id="146"> Well, I suppose you'd have to start somewhere... </seg>
<seg id="147"> Go and light the goddamn candle. Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="148"> And so, my life began. </seg>
<seg id="149"> Junior Lobby Boy in-training, Grand Budapest Hotel, under the strict command of Monsieur Gustave H. </seg>
<seg id="150"> I became his pupil, and he was to be my counselor and guardian. GUSTAVE H: What is a Lobby Boy? </seg>
<seg id="151"> A Lobby Boy's completely invisible, yet always in sight. A Lobby Boy remembers what people hate. A Lobby Boy anticipates the client's needs before the needs are needed. </seg>
<seg id="152"> A Lobby Boy is, above all, discreet to a fault. Our guests know their deepest secrets, some of which are, frankly, rather unseemly, will go with us to our graves. So keep your mouth shut, Zero. - Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="153"> That's all for now. </seg>
<seg id="154"> I began to realize that many of the hotel's most valued and distinguished guests came for him. It seemed to be an essential part of his duties. </seg>
<seg id="155"> Ah! ...but I believe it was also his pleasure. The requirements were always the same. </seg>
<seg id="156"> They had to be rich, old, insecure, vain, superficial, blonde, needy. Why blonde? </seg>
<seg id="157"> Because they all were. He was, by the way, the most liberally perfumed man I had ever encountered. The scent announced his approach from a great distance and lingered for many minutes after he was gone. I worked six days each week plus a half-day Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="158"> Our meals were small but frequent, for stamina. Two breakfasts, two lunches and a late supper. Monsieur Gustave also delivered a nightly sermon. Rudeness is merely the expression of fear. </seg>
<seg id="159"> People fear they won't get what they want. The most dreadful and unattractive person only needs to be loved, and they will open up like a flower. </seg>
<seg id="160"> I am reminded of a verse, "The painter's brush touched the inchoate face by ends of nimble bristles "and with their blush of first color, "rendered her lifeless cheek living." </seg>
<seg id="161"> MR. MOUSTAFA: His own dinner, he took alone in his room. </seg>
<seg id="162"> The identity of the owner of the hotel was unknown to all of us. </seg>
<seg id="163"> Each month, his emissary, known as Deputy Kovacs, arrived to review the books and convey messages on behalf of the mysterious proprietor. </seg>
<seg id="164"> On these occasions, Monsieur Gustave and our business manager, Herr Becker, met with him in private consultation above Reception. </seg>
<seg id="165"> This was also when I met Agatha, but we won't discuss that. What do you want? Look. </seg>
<seg id="166"> Dear God. </seg>
<seg id="167"> I'm terribly sorry, sir. </seg>
<seg id="168"> We must go to her. - We must? </seg>
<seg id="169"> Tout de suite. She needs me, and I need you to help me with my bags and so on. </seg>
<seg id="170"> - How fast can you pack? - Five minutes. </seg>
<seg id="171"> Do it. And bring a bottle of the Pouilly-Jouvet '26 in an ice bucket with two glasses so we don't have to drink the cat piss they serve in the dining car. </seg>
<seg id="172"> I blame myself. She tried to tell me she had a premonition. I didn't listen. All of Lutz will be dressed in black, except her own ghastly, deceitful children whom she loathed and couldn't bear to kiss hello. They'll be dancing like gypsies. </seg>
<seg id="173"> There's really no point in doing anything in life, because it's all over in the blink of an eye... </seg>
<seg id="174"> And, the next thing you know, rigor mortis sets in. Oh, how the good die young. </seg>
<seg id="175"> With any luck, she's left a few Klubecks for your old friend, but one never knows until the ink is dry on the death certificate. </seg>
<seg id="176"> She was dynamite in the sack, by the way. </seg>
<seg id="177"> She was 84, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="178"> I've had older. </seg>
<seg id="179"> When you're young, it's all fillet steak, but as the years go by, you have to move on to the cheaper cuts, which is fine with me, because I like those. More flavorful, or so they say. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Why are we stopping at a barley field? </seg>
<seg id="181"> Well, hello there, chaps. Documents, please. With pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="182"> It's not a very flattering portrait, I'm afraid. I was once considered a great beauty. </seg>
<seg id="183"> What does the "F" stand for? Fritz? Franz? </seg>
<seg id="184"> - Franz. - I knew it! </seg>
<seg id="185"> He's making a funny face. </seg>
<seg id="186"> That's a Migratory Visa with Stage Three Worker Status, Franz, darling. </seg>
<seg id="187"> He's with me. </seg>
<seg id="188"> Come outside, please. </seg>
<seg id="189"> Now, wait a minute. Sit down, Zero. His papers are in order. </seg>
<seg id="190"> I cross-referenced them myself with the Bureau of Labor and Servitude. </seg>
<seg id="191"> You can't arrest him simply because he's a bloody immigrant. </seg>
<seg id="192"> He hasn't done anything wrong. </seg>
<seg id="193"> Stop it, damn you! </seg>
<seg id="194"> Never mind, Monsieur Gustave! Let them proceed! </seg>
<seg id="195"> Ow! That hurts! </seg>
<seg id="196"> You filthy, goddamn, pock-marked, fascist assholes! </seg>
<seg id="197"> Take your hands off my Lobby Boy! </seg>
<seg id="198"> What's the problem? </seg>
<seg id="199"> This is outrageous. </seg>
<seg id="200"> The young man works for me at the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad. </seg>
<seg id="201"> Monsieur Gustave? </seg>
<seg id="202"> My name is Henckels. </seg>
<seg id="203"> I'm the son of Dr. and Mrs. Wolfgang Henckels-Bergersdörfer. Do you remember me? I know exactly who you are. It's uncanny. You're little Albert. I'm terribly embarrassed. Release them. Release them. </seg>
<seg id="204"> Your colleague is stateless. He'll need to apply for a revised Special Transit Permit, which at this point may be very difficult to acquire. Take this. </seg>
<seg id="205"> It's temporary but it's the best I can offer, I'm afraid. And how's your wonderful mother? - She's very well, thank you. - I adore her. - Send my love. - I will. </seg>
<seg id="206"> Your companion was very kind to me when I was a lonely little boy. </seg>
<seg id="207"> My men and I apologize for disturbing you. I beg your pardon, sir. </seg>
<seg id="208"> You see? There are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Indeed, that's what we provide in our own modest, humble, insignificant... </seg>
<seg id="210"> Oh, fuck it. </seg>
<seg id="211"> Where is she, Clotilde? Take me to her. You're looking so well, darling. You really are. They've done a marvelous job. </seg>
<seg id="212"> I don't know what sort of cream they've put on you down at the morgue, but I want some. Honestly, you look better than you have in years. You look like you're alive. </seg>
<seg id="213"> Oh, you changed it after all. It's perfect. - Clotilde? - Oui, Monsieur Gustave? </seg>
<seg id="214"> A glass of chilled water with no ice, please. Oh. All right, then. </seg>
<seg id="215"> I shan't be long, darling. We were escorted through a green baize door, down a narrow service corridor and into the butler's pantry. </seg>
<seg id="216"> A moment later, the kitchen passage swung open and a small servant dressed in white jolted into the room. I've never forgotten the look on that man's face. What the devil is going on? </seg>
<seg id="217"> I, myself, had never set foot inside a house of this kind in my life. </seg>
<seg id="218"> I understood very little about the events that were to follow. </seg>
<seg id="219"> But, eventually, I came to recognize, when the destiny of a great fortune is at stake, men's greed spreads like a poison in the bloodstream. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Uncles, nephews, cousins, in-laws of increasingly tenuous connection. The old woman's most distant relations had come foraging out of the woodwork. </seg>
<seg id="221"> At the head of this congregation, it was a disorienting coincidence, we discovered our own Deputy Kovacs, himself an important attorney, of course. </seg>
<seg id="222"> He was the executor of the dead widow's estate. This is Madame D's last will and testament. </seg>
<seg id="223"> It consists of a general tontine drawn up before the event of her husband's death 46 years ago, in combination with 635 amendments, notations, corrections, and letters of wishes executed during the subsequent decades. </seg>
<seg id="224"> The ultimate legality of this accumulation requires further analysis, but in the opinion of this office, it was Madame D's intention that control of the vast bulk of her estate should be transferred, forthwith, to her son, Dmitri, with special allowances for his sisters, Marguerite, Laetizia, and Carolina, and minor gifts for various members of the extended family as shown in the List of Recipients, which I will elucidate in due course. </seg>
<seg id="225"> However. An additional codicil, delivered into my possession by post only this morning, and, by all indications, sent by Madame D during the last hours of her life, contains an amendment to the original certificate, which, as prescribed by law, I will read to you now. </seg>
<seg id="226"> The authenticity of this document has not yet been confirmed by the presiding magistrate, so I ask that all parties be patient and refrain from comment until such time as our investigations can be completed. </seg>
<seg id="227"> "To my esteemed friend who comforted me in my later years "and brought sunshine into the life of an old woman "who thought that she would never be happy again. </seg>
<seg id="228"> "Monsieur Gustave H, "I bequeath, bestow and devise, free of all taxation "and with full and absolute fiduciary entitlement, "the painting known as 'Boy with Apple... Wow! "...by Johannes van Hoytl..." </seg>
<seg id="229"> I can't believe it. "...the younger..." What? "...which gave us both so much pleasure." </seg>
<seg id="230"> The van Hoytl? - Tax-free? - Can she do that? Who's Gustave H? </seg>
<seg id="231"> I'm afraid that's me, darling. That fucking faggot! He's a concierge. What are you doing here? I've come to pay my respects to a great woman whom I loved. </seg>
<seg id="232"> - This man is an intruder in my home! - It's not yours yet, Dmitri. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Only when probate is granted, and the Deed of Entitlement... </seg>
<seg id="234"> You're not getting Boy with  Apple, you goddamn little fruit! </seg>
<seg id="235"> How's that supposed to make me feel? </seg>
<seg id="236"> Call the police. We're pressing charges. </seg>
<seg id="237"> This criminal has plagued my family for nearly 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="238"> He's a ruthless adventurer and a con-artist who preys on mentally feeble, sick old ladies, and he probably fucks them, too! </seg>
<seg id="239"> I go to bed with all my friends. Where's Céline? </seg>
<seg id="240"> What? She's dead. We're reading her will. </seg>
<seg id="241"> Oh, yes, yes, of course. </seg>
<seg id="242"> If I learn you ever once laid a finger on my mother's body, living or dead, I swear to God, I'll out your throat! You hear me? </seg>
<seg id="243"> I thought I was supposed to be a fucking faggot. - You are, but you're bisexual. - Let's change the subject. I'm leaving. </seg>
<seg id="244"> That picture, Boy with Apple, is priceless. Understand? Congratulations, Monsieur Gustave! </seg>
<seg id="245"> They're going to fight me for the son of a bitch. - Is it very beautiful? - Beyond description. </seg>
<seg id="246"> "E'en the most gifted bard's rhyme can only sing "but to the lack of her and all she isn't! "His tongue doth..." Can I see it? I don't see why not. </seg>
<seg id="247"> This is van Hoytl's exquisite portrayal of a beautiful boy on the cusp of manhood. Blond, smooth. Skin as white as that milk. </seg>
<seg id="248"> Of impeccable provenance. One of the last in private hands, and unquestionably, the best. It's a masterpiece. </seg>
<seg id="249"> The rest of this shit is worthless junk. </seg>
<seg id="250"> What did you want to tell me, before? I think I cannot say right now. </seg>
<seg id="251"> Write me tomorrow. Lutzbahn Station! I'll never part with it. It reminded her of me. It will remind me of her. Always. I'll die with this picture above my bed. See the resemblance? Oh, yes. Actually, we should sell it. </seg>
<seg id="252"> Sooner rather than later, in case they try to steal it back. Plus, something about those lunatic foot-soldiers on the express... </seg>
<seg id="253"> This could be a tricky war and a long dry spell in the hotel trade. For all we know, they could board us up tomorrow. Let's make a solemn blood-pact. </seg>
<seg id="254"> We'll contact the black market and liquidate Boy with Apple by the end of the week, then leave the country and lay low somewhere along the Maltese Riviera until the troubles blow over and we resume our posts. </seg>
<seg id="255"> In exchange for your help, your loyalty and your services as my personal valet, I pledge to you 1.5% of the net sale price. </seg>
<seg id="256"> Could we make it 10? 10? Are you joking? That's more than I'd pay an actual dealer, and you wouldn't know Chiaroscuro from chicken giblets. </seg>
<seg id="257"> No, 1.5 is correct. But I'll tell you what, if I die first, and I most certainly will, you will be my sole heir. There's not much in the kitty except a set of ivory-backed hairbrushes and my library of romantic poetry, but when the time comes, these will be yours, along with whatever we haven't already spent on whores and whiskey. This is our sacred bond. I'll draw it up right now. </seg>
<seg id="258"> I, Monsieur Gustave H, being of relatively sound mind and body, on this day, the 19th of October, in the year of our Lord 1932... </seg>
<seg id="259"> He never told me where he came from. I never asked who his family had been. Excuse me. </seg>
<seg id="260"> The police are here. They asked for you. Tell them I'll be right down. Okay. </seg>
<seg id="261"> Have you ever been questioned by the authorities? Yes, on one occasion I was arrested and tortured by the rebel militia after the Desert Uprising. </seg>
<seg id="262"> You know the drill, then. Zip it. Of course. You've never heard the word "van Hoytl" in your life. Okay, let's go. How may we serve you, gentlemen? Ah, Inspector Henckels. </seg>
<seg id="263"> "By order of the Commissioner of Police, Zubrowka Province, "I hereby place you under arrest for the murder "of Madame Céline Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis." </seg>
<seg id="264"> I knew there was something fishy. We never got the cause of death. She's been murdered and you think I did it. </seg>
<seg id="265"> Hey! </seg>
<seg id="266"> Stop! </seg>
<seg id="267"> What happened? </seg>
<seg id="268"> What happened, my dear Zero, is I beat the living shit out of a sniveling little runt called Pinky Bandinski who had the gall to question my virility, because if there's one thing we've learned from penny dreadfuls, it's that, when you find yourself in a place like this, you must never be a candy-ass. </seg>
<seg id="269"> You've got to prove yourself from Day One. You've got to win their respect. You should take a long look at his ugly mug this morning. He's, actually, become a dear friend. You'll meet him, I hope. </seg>
<seg id="270"> So. You've talked to Kovacs? </seg>
<seg id="271"> I saw him last night in secret. </seg>
<seg id="272"> He made me take an oath on a Bible I wouldn't tell a soul. </seg>
<seg id="273"> - You're supposed to also. - I'll do that later. </seg>
<seg id="274"> - He suspects you're innocent. - Of course he does. </seg>
<seg id="275"> What's the charge? </seg>
<seg id="276"> In the small hours of the evening of 19 October, </seg>
<seg id="277"> an individual well-known to the house and staff, a Monsieur Gustave H, did arrive at the Desgoffe und Taxis residence in Lutz and entered by the rear service alley, alerting no one to his presence, </seg>
<seg id="278"> and did then proceed by way of back stairs and servants' passage, to deliver himself into the private chambers of Madame D. There is no evidence to indicate whether this visit had been pre-arranged with her or not. </seg>
<seg id="279"> The next morning Madame D was found dead by strychnine poisoning. Monsieur Gustave was not observed on the premises again until, of course, 24 hours later. </seg>
<seg id="280"> The identity of his accusers is made clear in this notarized deposition. </seg>
<seg id="281"> They include, essentially, all members of the extended family, but the key witness who actually ostensibly saw the alleged events appears to have fled the jurisdiction. His whereabouts are currently unknown, but he's being sought and pursued by the relevant authorities. </seg>
<seg id="282"> Who is he? </seg>
<seg id="283"> - Serge? - I'm afraid so. </seg>
<seg id="284"> That little prick. </seg>
<seg id="285"> No, I don't believe it. They put him up to it. I've been dropped into a nest of vipers. You have an alibi? </seg>
<seg id="286"> Of course, but she's married to the Duke of Westphalia. </seg>
<seg id="287"> I can't allow her name to get mixed-up in all this monkey business. </seg>
<seg id="288"> - Your life may be at stake. - I know, but the bitch legged it. </seg>
<seg id="289"> She's already on board the Queen Nasstasja halfway to Dutch Tanganyika. Don't give up. </seg>
<seg id="290"> The details of the conspiracy, now a matter of public record, were, at that time, impossible for us to apprehend. I'm looking for Serge X, a young man in the service of my employer, the family Desgoffe und Taxis of Schloss Lutz. </seg>
<seg id="291"> - Yes, sir? - You're his sister? </seg>
<seg id="292"> - Yes, sir. - Seen him lately? </seg>
<seg id="293"> - No, sir. - No, sir? </seg>
<seg id="294"> - No, sir. </seg>
<seg id="295"> I need to find him right away, for his own safety and everybody else's. </seg>
<seg id="296"> If he shows up... </seg>
<seg id="297"> - Yes, sir? - Tell him Jopling says, </seg>
<seg id="298"> "Come home." </seg>
<seg id="299"> But one thing was certain, the Desgoffe und Taxis were a very powerful family, and time was not on our side. </seg>
<seg id="300"> A letter from Monsieur Gustave. Zero. </seg>
<seg id="301"> - You want me to? - Read it. </seg>
<seg id="302"> "My dear and trusted colleagues..." </seg>
<seg id="303"> I miss you deeply as I write from the confines of my regrettable and preposterous incarceration. </seg>
<seg id="304"> Until I walk amongst you again as a free man, the Grand Budapest remains in your hands, as does its impeccable reputation. </seg>
<seg id="305"> Keep it spotless and glorify it. </seg>
<seg id="306"> Take extra special care of every little-bitty bit of it as if I were watching over you like a hawk with a horse whip in its talons, because I am. </seg>
<seg id="307"> Should I discover a lapse of any variety during my absence, I promise, swift and merciless justice will descend upon you. A great and noble house has been placed under your protection. Tell Zero if you see any funny business. </seg>
<seg id="308"> "Your devoted Monsieur Gustave." </seg>
<seg id="309"> Then there's a poem, but we might want to start on the soup since it's 46 stanzas. </seg>
<seg id="310"> "A moist, black ash dampens the filth of a dung-dark rat's nest "and mingles with the thick scent of wood rot "while the lark song of a guttersnipe..." </seg>
<seg id="311"> I never trusted that butler. </seg>
<seg id="312"> - He's too honest. - Too honest, you say? </seg>
<seg id="313"> Mmm-hmm. Right, well, be that as it may, find him quick and make it snappy. </seg>
<seg id="314"> May I offer any of you inmates a plate of mush? </seg>
<seg id="315"> No? Anyone? </seg>
<seg id="316"> You with the very large scar on your face? </seg>
<seg id="317"> Try it. It's actually quite warm and nourishing this morning. It needs a dash of salt. Good day. </seg>
<seg id="318"> Mush, gents? Any takers? Suit yourselves. </seg>
<seg id="319"> Rise and shine. Chop, chop. Good morning, Pinky. </seg>
<seg id="320"> - Mendl's again? - Precisely. </seg>
<seg id="321"> Who's got the throat slitter? - Out of this world. - Mendl's is the best. </seg>
<seg id="322"> - Well, back to work. Monsieur Gustave? Yes? </seg>
<seg id="323"> Me and the boys talked it over. We think you're a really straight fellow. Well, I've never been accused of that before, but I appreciate the sentiment. </seg>
<seg id="324"> You're one of us now. What a lovely thing to say. Thank you, dear Pinky. Thank you, Gunther. Thank you, Wolf. Anything else? Tell him, Ludwig. </seg>
<seg id="325"> Checkpoint 19 ain't no two-bit hoosegow. You got broad-gauge iron bars on every door, vent and window. You got 72 guards on the floor and 16 more in the towers. You got a 325-foot drop into a moat full of crocodiles. But, like the best of them, it's got a soft spot, which in this case happens to take the form of a storm-drain sewer system dating from the time of the original rock fortification way back in the Middle Ages. </seg>
<seg id="326"> Now, nobody's saying it's a stroll down a tree-lined promenade with a fine lady and a white poodle, but it's got what you'd call "vulnerability," and that's our bread and butter. </seg>
<seg id="327"> Take a look. Who drew this? What do you mean, "Who drew this?" I did. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Very good. You've got a wonderful line, Ludwig. This shows great artistic promise. Question, how do you intend to penetrate this lowest rudiment? It's 25 inches of reinforced granite masonry, is it not? Digging with the throat-slitter, I expect this would take three to six months of continual effort, during which time several of our members will have been violently executed. </seg>
<seg id="329"> You hit the nail on the head, Mr. Gustave. We got fake documents, second-hand street clothes, a rope ladder made of sticks and bunk-linens, but we need digging tools, which are proving hard to come by in this flop-house. At this point in the story, the old man fell silent and pushed away his saddle of lamb. </seg>
<seg id="330"> His eyes went blank as two stones. I could see he was in distress. </seg>
<seg id="331"> - Are you ill, Mr. Moustafa? - I finally asked. - Oh, dear me, no. - He said. </seg>
<seg id="332"> It's only that I don't know how to proceed. He was crying. </seg>
<seg id="333"> You see, I never speak of Agatha, because even at the thought of her name I'm unable to control my emotions. Well, I suppose there's no way around it. </seg>
<seg id="334"> You see, she saved us. On our third formal rendezvous, I had asked for her hand in marriage and she had agreed. </seg>
<seg id="335"> - Will you marry me? - Yes. </seg>
<seg id="336"> We did not have 50 Klubecks between the two of us. No one knew, of course, but, then, who would have cared? We were each completely on our own in the world, and we were deeply in love. </seg>
<seg id="337"> - Here. - Thank you. - It's a book. - I see. </seg>
<seg id="338"> Romantic Poetry, Volume One. Monsieur Gustave recommended it. I have a copy of my own as well. - I ruined the surprise, I suppose. - I'll go ahead and open it, anyway. Read the inscription. </seg>
<seg id="339"> Monsieur Gustave insisted on an immediate and thorough cross-examination. </seg>
<seg id="340"> She's charming. She's so charming. ...during which he presented Agatha with a porcelain pendant and five dozen individually tissue-wrapped white tulips in a box the size of a child's coffin. </seg>
<seg id="341"> - It's not right. - I beg your pardon? </seg>
<seg id="342"> Why is he sulking? She's my girlfriend. You can't just buy her things. I'm only interviewing this vision of loveliness on your behalf. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Never be jealous in this life, Zero, not even for an instant. Is he flirting with you? </seg>
<seg id="344"> - Yes. - I approve of this union. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Agatha, my beauty, return to your beloved. Soon we learned... </seg>
<seg id="346"> Blessings upon you both. ...not only was Agatha immensely skilled with a palette knife and a butter-cream flourish... </seg>
<seg id="347"> - Mendl. - Go. </seg>
<seg id="348"> ...she was also very brave. </seg>
<seg id="349"> I believe she was born that way. Something's missing. A crucial document, either misplaced or, conceivably, destroyed. I don't know what it contains, I don't know what it represents, I don't know what it is, but there are traces and shadows of it everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="350"> Now, I don't want to alarm you, and I don't expect to see any significant change in the magistrate's ultimate decision vis-à-vis your own inheritance, but, especially given the circumstances of the death, as well as the disappearance of the key witness in the murder case, Serge X, I suggest that we immediately bring this matter to the attention of the municipal inspector so that there can be absolutely no question of impropriety at any future date. </seg>
<seg id="351"> - Agreed?-  Not agreed. - Not agreed? - Not agreed. - Can I ask you a question, Vilmos? - Yes, Dmitri? - Who are you working for? - I beg your pardon? Who are you working for? I thought you're supposed to be our lawyer. Well, in point of fact, I'm the executor of the estate. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In this particular situation, I represent the deceased. Oh, yeah? Yeah. A provision for my fees was included in the... Just wrap it up and don't make waves. Agreed? </seg>
<seg id="353"> I'm an attorney. I'm obligated to proceed according to the rule of law. Not agreed. This stinks, sisters. Did he just throw my cat out the window? I don't think so. No. - Did he? - Jopling? Okay. </seg>
<seg id="354"> There's something I haven't told you, Agatha. Okay. We stole a painting. It's very valuable, maybe five million Klubecks, in fact. I don't know if anyone's even noticed it's missing yet, but if something should happen to me... You steal art? </seg>
<seg id="355"> One picture. Anyway, we need to make a plan for your survival. Hide this. It's in code and you might need a magnifying glass to read it, but it tells you exactly where and how to find Boy with Apple. Don't take less than half the retail asking price. Also... </seg>
<seg id="356"> - Zero, I'm a baker. - You're a pastry chef. I'm not a fence, if that's the term. I don't trade in stolen property. I said it wrong. She willed it to him. Go to sleep. Yes, Herr Mendl. </seg>
<seg id="357"> - Hide this. - No. </seg>
<seg id="358"> Okay, but take it anyway. The next morning, Herr Becker received a peculiar, last-minute notice from the office of Deputy Kovacs, postponing their scheduled meeting, in perpetuity. </seg>
<seg id="359"> Let's blow. </seg>
<seg id="360"> - How did you get out there? - Shut the fuck up. </seg>
<seg id="361"> These guys are trying to escape. </seg>
<seg id="362"> What's wrong with you, you goddamn snitch? </seg>
<seg id="363"> Guard! Guard! </seg>
<seg id="364"> It's you. Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Thank you, you sweet, kind man. </seg>
<seg id="366"> Okay. </seg>
<seg id="367"> I suppose you'd call that a draw. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Good evening. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Let me introduce you. Pinky, Wolf, Ludwig, this is the divine Zero. </seg>
<seg id="370"> Gunther was slain in the catacombs. </seg>
<seg id="371"> Well, boys, who knows when we'll all meet again, but if one day... </seg>
<seg id="372"> Hold it. </seg>
<seg id="373"> No time to gab. </seg>
<seg id="374"> Take care of yourself, Mr. Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="375"> Good luck, kid. </seg>
<seg id="376"> - Which way to the safe house? - I couldn't find one. </seg>
<seg id="377"> No safe house? Really? We're completely on our own out here? </seg>
<seg id="378"> I'm afraid so. I asked around, but... </seg>
<seg id="379"> I understand. Too risky. We'll just have to wing it, I suppose. </seg>
<seg id="380"> Let's put on our disguises. </seg>
<seg id="381"> - We're wearing them. - No, we're not. </seg>
<seg id="382"> We said false whiskers and fake noses and so on. </seg>
<seg id="383"> - You didn't bring any? - I thought you were growing one. </seg>
<seg id="384"> And it wouldn't look realistic, would it? </seg>
<seg id="385"> No, when done properly, they're perfectly convincing. </seg>
<seg id="386"> But I take your point. So be it. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Give me a few squirts of L'air de Panache, please, will you? </seg>
<seg id="388"> - Can I not get a squirt, even? - I forgot the L'air de Panache. </seg>
<seg id="389"> Honestly, you forgot the L'air de Panache? </seg>
<seg id="390"> I don't believe it. How could you? </seg>
<seg id="391"> I've been in jail, Zero! Do you understand how humiliating this is? </seg>
<seg id="392"> I smell. </seg>
<seg id="393"> That's just marvelous, isn't it? </seg>
<seg id="394"> I suppose this is to be expected back in... Where do you come from again? </seg>
<seg id="395"> - Aq Salim al-Jabat. - Precisely. </seg>
<seg id="396"> I suppose this is to be expected back in Aq Salim al-Jabat where one's prized possessions are a stack of filthy carpets and a starving goat, and one sleeps behind a tent flap and survives on wild dates and scarabs. </seg>
<seg id="397"> But it's not how I trained you. </seg>
<seg id="398"> What on God's earth possessed you to leave the homeland where you obviously belong and travel unspeakable distances to become a penniless immigrant in a refined, highly-cultivated society that, quite frankly, could've gotten along very well without you? </seg>
<seg id="399"> The war. </seg>
<seg id="400"> Say again? </seg>
<seg id="401"> Well, you see, my father was murdered and the rest of my family were executed by firing squad. Our village was burned to the ground and those who managed to survive were forced to flee. </seg>
<seg id="402"> I left because of the war. </seg>
<seg id="403"> I see. So you're, actually, really more of a refugee, in that sense? </seg>
<seg id="404"> Truly. </seg>
<seg id="405"> Well, I suppose I'd better take back everything I just said. What a bloody idiot I am. Pathetic fool. </seg>
<seg id="406"> Goddamn, selfish bastard. </seg>
<seg id="407"> This is disgraceful, and it's beneath the standards of the Grand Budapest. I apologize on behalf of the hotel. </seg>
<seg id="408"> It's not your fault. You were just upset I forgot the perfume. Don't make excuses for me. I owe you my life. </seg>
<seg id="409"> You are my dear friend and protégé and I'm very proud of you. </seg>
<seg id="410"> You must know that. </seg>
<seg id="411"> I'm so sorry, Zero. </seg>
<seg id="412"> We're brothers. </seg>
<seg id="413"> How's our darling Agatha? </seg>
<seg id="414"> "'Twas first light when I saw her face upon the heath, "and hence did I return, day-by-day, entranced, "tho' vinegar did brine my heart, never..." </seg>
<seg id="415"> Very good. I'm going to stop you there because the alarm has sounded, but remember where we left off because I insist you finish later. </seg>
<seg id="416"> I want roadblocks at every junction for 50km. </seg>
<seg id="417"> I want rail blocks at every train station for 100km. </seg>
<seg id="418"> I want 50 men and 10 bloodhounds ready in five minutes. We're going to strip-search every pretzel-Ha us, Waffel-hut, Biergarten and especially every grand hotel from Äugenzburg to Zilchbrück. </seg>
<seg id="419"> These men are dangerous, professional criminals. At least three of them are anyway. </seg>
<seg id="420"> Who are you? </seg>
<seg id="421"> What are you doing here? Civilian personnel aren't permitted in the cellblock. - This is a military investigation. - This is Mr. Jopling, sir. His employer's mother was one of the victims... </seg>
<seg id="422"> Shut up. </seg>
<seg id="423"> You work for the family Desgoffe und Taxis? </seg>
<seg id="424"> Are you aware of the murder of Deputy Vilmos Kovacs on 23rd October? </seg>
<seg id="425"> I'm aware of his disappearance. </seg>
<seg id="426"> His body was found stuffed in a sarcophagus behind a storage room at the Kunstmuseum late last night. </seg>
<seg id="427"> He was short four fingers. </seg>
<seg id="428"> - What do you know about that? - Nothing. </seg>
<seg id="429"> Escort Mr. Jopling off the premises. </seg>
<seg id="430"> Mendl's. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Operator, get me the Excelsior Palace in Baden-Jurgen and reverse the charges, please. </seg>
<seg id="432"> We've no choice. There's nowhere else to turn. </seg>
<seg id="433"> I'll hold. Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="434"> It's our only hope. Otherwise, I shouldn't even mention its existence to you. </seg>
<seg id="435"> It goes without saying, never breathe a word about this to a living soul. </seg>
<seg id="436"> - Do you swear? Of course. - What is it, in fact? </seg>
<seg id="437"> I can't say. </seg>
<seg id="438"> How does one come by front-row aisle seats for a first night at the Opera Toscana with one day's notice? </seg>
<seg id="439"> How does one arrange a private viewing of the tapestry collection at the Royal Saxon Gallery? </seg>
<seg id="440"> How does one secure a corner table at Chez Dominique on a Thursday? </seg>
<seg id="441"> Ivan, darling, it's Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="442"> Well, I was until about five minutes ago. </seg>
<seg id="443"> We've taken it upon ourselves to clear out in a hurry if you see what I mean. </seg>
<seg id="444"> Well, through a sewer, as it happens. Exactly. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Listen, Ivan, I'm sorry to out you off, but we're in a bit of a bind. </seg>
<seg id="446"> This is an official request. </seg>
<seg id="447"> I'm formally calling upon the special services of... </seg>
<seg id="448"> IVAN: I'll call you back, Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="449"> Right. Stand by. </seg>
<seg id="450"> I beg your pardon. Do you prefer to walk? </seg>
<seg id="451"> We're right here. It's very simple. </seg>
<seg id="452"> Straight down the corniche, then left. </seg>
<seg id="453"> Jojo, see the gentleman out. </seg>
<seg id="454"> Get me Monsieur Georges at the Château Luxe, please. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Higher, goddammit, higher! </seg>
<seg id="456"> Take over. </seg>
<seg id="457"> - Monsieur Georges. - Higher. </seg>
<seg id="458"> I see. Straightaway. </seg>
<seg id="459"> Get me Monsieur Robin at I'Hôtel Côte du Cap, please. ...and two and three. </seg>
<seg id="460"> Monsieur Robin. There's a call from Monsieur Dino for you. </seg>
<seg id="461"> Take over. </seg>
<seg id="462"> - One, two, three. - Yes, Dino. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Yes, Dino. Okay, Dino. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Get me Monsieur Martin at the Ritz Imperial, please. </seg>
<seg id="465"> Too much salt. </seg>
<seg id="466"> Not enough pepper. </seg>
<seg id="467"> Take over. </seg>
<seg id="468"> - Robin? Martin. Too much salt. </seg>
<seg id="469"> So I've heard. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Maybe. Let me make a few calls. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Serge X, missing. Deputy Kovacs, also missing. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Madame D, dead. Boy with  Apple, stolen, by us. </seg>
<seg id="473"> Dmitri and Jopling, ruthless, cold-blooded savages. </seg>
<seg id="474"> Gustave H, at large. What else? </seg>
<seg id="475"> - Zero, confused. - Zero, confused, indeed. </seg>
<seg id="476"> The plot "thickens," as they say. </seg>
<seg id="477"> Why, by the way? Is it a soup metaphor? </seg>
<seg id="478"> I don't know. </seg>
<seg id="479"> Get in. </seg>
<seg id="480"> We found the butler. </seg>
<seg id="481"> He's hiding out in the remote foothills near Gabelmeister's Peak. </seg>
<seg id="482"> Our contact convinced him to meet you midday tomorrow. </seg>
<seg id="483"> at the observatory on the summit. </seg>
<seg id="484"> Tell no one. He'll explain everything. </seg>
<seg id="485"> Your train departs in four and a half minutes. </seg>
<seg id="486"> Here's your tickets. </seg>
<seg id="487"> - Third class? - It was overbooked. </seg>
<seg id="488"> but the conductor used to be a sommelier at the old Versailles. </seg>
<seg id="489"> He pulled some strings. </seg>
<seg id="490"> You'll need these for the dining car. </seg>
<seg id="491"> One last thing. </seg>
<seg id="492"> L'air de Panache. </seg>
<seg id="493"> They only had the half-ounce. </seg>
<seg id="494"> We should give him something as a symbolic gesture. </seg>
<seg id="495"> - How much money you got? - 42 Klubecks and 3 postage stamps. </seg>
<seg id="496"> Give me 25. Yes. </seg>
<seg id="497"> - Bless you. - Please. </seg>
<seg id="498"> - I've got to hand it to him. - Jesus Christ. </seg>
<seg id="499"> I didn't see that coming. Well, what do you want next? </seg>
<seg id="500"> Talk to the club-footed sister again, and, this time, be persuasive. </seg>
<seg id="501"> Goddamn son of a bitch. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Holy fuck! </seg>
<seg id="503"> What's the meaning of this shit? </seg>
<seg id="504"> Boy with Apple? I thought you'd hidden it. </seg>
<seg id="505"> Why are you only noticing now? I assumed it went to the tax appraiser. </seg>
<seg id="506"> Are you fucking kidding me? </seg>
<seg id="507"> I believe it was removed by Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="508"> I'm not angry with Serge. </seg>
<seg id="509"> You can't blame someone for their basic lack of moral fiber. </seg>
<seg id="510"> He's a frightened, little, yellow-bellied coward. </seg>
<seg id="511"> It's not his fault, is it? I don't know. It depends. </seg>
<seg id="512"> Well, you can say that about most anything. </seg>
<seg id="513"> "It depends." Of course it depends. </seg>
<seg id="514"> Of course it depends. Of course it depends. </seg>
<seg id="515"> Yes, I suppose you're right. Of course it depends. </seg>
<seg id="516"> That doesn't mean I'm not going to throttle the little swamp rat. </seg>
<seg id="517"> May I officiate, by the way? The ceremony? </seg>
<seg id="518"> With pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="519"> I must say, I find that girl utterly delightful. </seg>
<seg id="520"> Flat as a board, enormous birthmark the shape of Mexico over half her face, sweating for hours on end in that sweltering kitchen while Mendl, genius though he is, looms over her like a hulking gorilla. Yet without question, without fail, always and invariably, she's exceedingly lovely. </seg>
<seg id="521"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="522"> Because of her purity. </seg>
<seg id="523"> She admires you as well, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="524"> - Does she? - Very much. </seg>
<seg id="525"> That's a good sign, you know. It means she "gets it." </seg>
<seg id="526"> That's important. </seg>
<seg id="527"> Don't flirt with her. A radio telegram was delivered and signed for by the girl at 4:00 AM. The envelope was found near the body, but its contents were missing. </seg>
<seg id="528"> However, the telegraph office always keeps a carbon of the ticker tape for 24 hours. I copied it down. It reads as follows, "Pack your things stop. </seg>
<seg id="529"> "Be ready to leave at moment's notice stop. "Hide-out is vicinity of Gabelmeister's Peak stop. "Destroy this message all my love full stop." </seg>
<seg id="530"> Where's the basket? Where you headed, mister? Skiing? Sledding? Mountain climbing? </seg>
<seg id="531"> By express wireless, I wrote Agatha with instructions to move to our pre-arranged hideout, a Gypsy caravan on the outer Nebelsbad road, while Monsieur Gustave and I continued east into the Zubrowkian Alps, toward our high-altitude rendezvous with the butler Serge X. As a precaution, we disembarked quietly in the freight yard just outside the station. </seg>
<seg id="532"> L'air de Panache. </seg>
<seg id="533"> It's a hell of a view. I give them that, for what's it's worth. </seg>
<seg id="534"> I agree. "'Tis oft'-remarked, no single, falling-flake does any other - "in its pure and perfect form..." - Somebody's coming. </seg>
<seg id="535"> Are you Monsieur Gustave of the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad? </seg>
<seg id="536"> Get on the next cable car. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Are you Monsieur Gustave of the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad? </seg>
<seg id="538"> Switch with me. </seg>
<seg id="539"> Are you Monsieur Gustave of the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad? </seg>
<seg id="540"> Put these on and sing. </seg>
<seg id="541"> - Are you Monsieur Gustave of the... - Yes, dammit. </seg>
<seg id="542"> Confess. </seg>
<seg id="543"> I'm innocent. </seg>
<seg id="544"> Hmm? No, no. </seg>
<seg id="545"> Forgive me, Monsieur Gustave. I never meant to betray you. </seg>
<seg id="546"> They threatened my life and now they've murdered my only family. No. Who did they kill this time? </seg>
<seg id="547"> - My dear sister. - The girl with the club foot? </seg>
<seg id="548"> - Yes. - Those fuckers! </seg>
<seg id="549"> I tried to warn you at the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="550"> I know, darling. Let's put that behind us. </seg>
<seg id="551"> Listen, I hate to put you on the spot, but I really must ask you to clear my name. </seg>
<seg id="552"> Obviously you're grieving... There's more. To the story. I get it. Go on. </seg>
<seg id="553"> I was the official witness in Madame D's presence to the creation of a second will to be executed only in the event of her death by murder. </seg>
<seg id="554"> - A second will? - Right. - In case she got bumped off? - Right. </seg>
<seg id="555"> - Uh-huh? - But they destroyed it. </seg>
<seg id="556"> - Oh, dear. - However... </seg>
<seg id="557"> - Uh-huh? - I pulled a copy. A second copy of the second will? </seg>
<seg id="558"> - Right. - Uh-huh? </seg>
<seg id="559"> What does it say? Where is it? What's it all about, dammit? </seg>
<seg id="560"> Don't keep us in suspense. This has been a complete fucking nightmare. </seg>
<seg id="561"> Just tell us what the fuck is going on! </seg>
<seg id="562"> Serge? Serge? Serge! </seg>
<seg id="563"> Bloody hell. They've strangled the poor slob. </seg>
<seg id="564"> Come on! Let's go! </seg>
<seg id="565"> - What do we do if we catch him? - I don't know. </seg>
<seg id="566"> He's a homicidal psychopath. Let's stop. </seg>
<seg id="567"> I can't. I can barely steer. </seg>
<seg id="568"> You sick, pathetic creep. I hate you. </seg>
<seg id="569"> "'If this do be me end, farewell!' cried the wounded piper-boy, "whilst the muskets cracked and the yeomen roared 'Hurrah!' "And the ramparts fell. "'Methinks me breathes me last, me fears!' said he..." </seg>
<seg id="570"> Holy shit! You got him! </seg>
<seg id="571"> Well done, Zero! </seg>
<seg id="572"> Gustave H! You are a fugitive from justice! </seg>
<seg id="573"> Surrender lawfully and I will personally vouchsafe your fair treatment. </seg>
<seg id="574"> Do not attempt to flee! </seg>
<seg id="575"> - What do you think? - I don't know. </seg>
<seg id="576"> I'd rather jump off this cliff right now than go back to fucking prison. </seg>
<seg id="577"> I say we steal that sick maniac's motorcycle, go fetch Agatha, take back Boy with Apple and head for the Maltese Riviera, once and for all. </seg>
<seg id="578"> Very good! You're so extraordinary, Zero. Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="579"> A moment of silence in memoriam of a devoted servant killed violently during the conduct of his duties. Goodbye, Serge. </seg>
<seg id="580"> Okay, let's go. </seg>
<seg id="581"> The war began at midnight. </seg>
<seg id="582"> Pffeifelstad fell by lunch under heavy shelling, and 10 battalions surged across the long western border. High-command advanced to Nebelsbad. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Compliments of Herr Mendl, for the executive staff. </seg>
<seg id="584"> General Stieglitz requests a garden-view sitting room with an extra roll-away. </seg>
<seg id="585"> Let's put him in the Duke Leopold Suite. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Secretary Woroniecki's office cabled. </seg>
<seg id="587"> He's checking in a day early. Rooms 401 -2-3. </seg>
<seg id="588"> Tell Tactical Logistics we're moving them to a standard double on the third floor. </seg>
<seg id="589"> They'll need more space than that. </seg>
<seg id="590"> The beginning of the end of the end of the beginning has begun. A sad finale played off-key on a broken-down saloon piano in the outskirts of a forgotten ghost town. </seg>
<seg id="591"> I'd rather not bear witness to such blasphemy. </seg>
<seg id="592"> Me neither. </seg>
<seg id="593"> The Grand Budapest has become a troops' barracks. </seg>
<seg id="594"> I shall never cross its threshold again in my lifetime. </seg>
<seg id="595"> Me neither. Never again shall I... </seg>
<seg id="596"> Actually, I think we might be going in there right now after all. </seg>
<seg id="597"> Dmitri. </seg>
<seg id="598"> Agatha. </seg>
<seg id="599"> Good evening, Mr. Desgoffe und Taxis. I'm Monsieur Chuck. </seg>
<seg id="600"> We've booked you and your sisters into the King Ferdinand Suite. </seg>
<seg id="601"> Good evening. General von Shrecker asked me... </seg>
<seg id="602"> Who's that? I beg your pardon? </seg>
<seg id="603"> I think that girl's got my picture. Excuse me. </seg>
<seg id="604"> Six. Hold it. </seg>
<seg id="605"> Six. </seg>
<seg id="606"> Compliments of Herr Mendl. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Excuse me. </seg>
<seg id="608"> Have you seen a pastry girl with a package under her arm in the last minute and a half? </seg>
<seg id="609"> Yep. She just got on the elevator with Mr. Desgoffe und Taxis. </seg>
<seg id="610"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="611"> I'm sorry. Who are you? </seg>
<seg id="612"> Otto, sir, the new Lobby Boy. </seg>
<seg id="613"> You haven't been trained properly. </seg>
<seg id="614"> A Lobby Boy never provides information of that kind. </seg>
<seg id="615"> You're a stone wall. Understood? </seg>
<seg id="616"> Pretty picture. </seg>
<seg id="617"> Sixth floor. </seg>
<seg id="618"> Where's Boy with Apple? </seg>
<seg id="619"> None of your goddamn business! </seg>
<seg id="620"> I'm going to blast your candy-ass once and for all right now. </seg>
<seg id="621"> Drop your weapon! </seg>
<seg id="622"> Cease fire! Cease fire! Whoa! </seg>
<seg id="623"> Stop it! </seg>
<seg id="624"> Who's shooting who? </seg>
<seg id="625"> That's Gustave H! The escaped murderer and art thief. </seg>
<seg id="626"> I've got him cornered! </seg>
<seg id="627"> That's Dmitri Desgoffe und Taxis! </seg>
<seg id="628"> He's responsible for the killing of Deputy Kovacs, Serge X and his club-footed sister, plus his own mother! </seg>
<seg id="629"> Nobody move. Everybody's under arrest. </seg>
<seg id="630"> Who's out the window? </seg>
<seg id="631"> Agatha! </seg>
<seg id="633"> Hang on! Here I come! </seg>
<seg id="634"> Something's on the back of the... </seg>
<seg id="635"> Agatha! </seg>
<seg id="636"> Agatha! </seg>
<seg id="637"> Are you all right? I think so. </seg>
<seg id="638"> Something's on the back of the picture. </seg>
<seg id="639"> She left everything to Monsieur Gustave, of course. </seg>
<seg id="640"> The mansion, known as Schloss Lutz, the factories, which produced weapons, medicine and textiles, an important newspaper syndicate, and perhaps you've already deduced this very institution, the Grand Budapest Hotel. </seg>
<seg id="641"> He anointed me his successor, and as the war continued, I served my adopted country from the narrow desk still found against the wall in the next room. </seg>
<seg id="642"> He was the same as his disciples, insecure, vain, superficial, blond, needy. In the end he was even rich. </seg>
<seg id="643"> He did not succeed, however, in growing old. </seg>
<seg id="644"> "Dearly beloved, we are gathered together... </seg>
<seg id="645"> Nor did my darling Agatha. </seg>
<seg id="646"> She and our infant son would be killed two years later by the Prussian grippe. An absurd little disease. </seg>
<seg id="647"> Today we treat it in a single week, but, in those days many millions died. </seg>
<seg id="648"> On the 21st day of the occupation, the morning the independent state of Zubrowka officially ceased to exist, we traveled with Monsieur Gustave to Lutz. </seg>
<seg id="649"> In answer to your earlier question, by the way, of course. </seg>
<seg id="650"> Zero asked me about my humble beginnings in the hotel trade. I was, perhaps, for a time, considered the best Lobby Boy we'd ever had at the Grand Budapest. </seg>
<seg id="651"> I think I can say that. </seg>
<seg id="652"> This one finally surpassed me. </seg>
<seg id="653"> Although, I must say, he had an exceptional teacher. </seg>
<seg id="654"> Truly. </seg>
<seg id="655"> "Whence came these two radiant, celestial brothers, "united, for an instant, "as they crossed the stratosphere of our starry window? </seg>
<seg id="656"> "One from the East and one from the West." </seg>
<seg id="657"> Very good. </seg>
<seg id="658"> Don't flirt with her. </seg>
<seg id="659"> Why are we stopping at a barley field again? </seg>
<seg id="660"> I find these black uniforms very drab. </seg>
<seg id="661"> Well, hello there, chaps. We were just talking about you. </seg>
<seg id="662"> - Documents, please. - With pleasure, as always. </seg>
<seg id="663"> You're the first of the official death squads to whom we've been formally introduced. </seg>
<seg id="664"> How do you do? </seg>
<seg id="665"> Plus ça change, am I right? Uh, that's a migratory visa with stage three worker status, darling. </seg>
<seg id="666"> Read this. </seg>
<seg id="667"> Come outside. Now, stay there. </seg>
<seg id="668"> I give you my word, if you lay a finger on this man, I'll see you dishonorably discharged, locked up in the stockade and hanged by sundown. </seg>
<seg id="669"> There are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity. You filthy, goddamn, pock-marked, fascist assholes! </seg>
<seg id="670"> He was one of them. </seg>
<seg id="671"> What more is there to say? </seg>
<seg id="672"> What happened in the end? </seg>
<seg id="673"> In the end they shot him. </seg>
<seg id="674"> So it all went to me. </seg>
<seg id="675"> After dinner, we went to collect the keys to our rooms, but Monsieur Jean had abandoned his post. I expect he's forgotten all about us. </seg>
<seg id="676"> In recent years, of course, such properties and holdings as the Grand Budapest had with very few exceptions become common property. </seg>
<seg id="677"> While the precise terms of his negotiation with the new government had never been announced, the result was an open secret, Zero Moustafa had traded a great and important fortune in exchange for one costly, unprofitable, doomed hotel. </seg>
<seg id="678"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="679"> Was it merely sentimental? </seg>
<seg id="680"> It was quite forward of me and a bit out of character, but I felt I must know, for my health, I suppose. </seg>
<seg id="681"> Forgive me for asking. I hope I haven't upset you. </seg>
<seg id="682"> No, of course not. </seg>
<seg id="683"> Is it simply your last connection to that vanished world, his world, if you will? </seg>
<seg id="684"> His world? </seg>
<seg id="685"> No, I don't think so. </seg>
<seg id="686"> You see, we shared a vocation. It wouldn't have been necessary. </seg>
<seg id="687"> No. The hotel I keep for Agatha. </seg>
<seg id="688"> We were happy here. </seg>
<seg id="689"> For a little while. </seg>
<seg id="690"> To be frank, I think his world had vanished long before he ever entered it. </seg>
<seg id="691"> But, I will say, he certainly sustained the illusion with a marvelous grace. </seg>
<seg id="692"> Are you going up? No, I'll sit for a little while. </seg>
<seg id="693"> Good night. </seg>
<seg id="694"> The next week, I sailed for a cure in South America and began a long, wandering journey abroad. </seg>
<seg id="695"> I did not return to Europe for many years. </seg>
<seg id="696"> It was an enchanting old ruin. </seg>
