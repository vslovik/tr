<seg id="1"> It is a very common mistake, it is believed that the imagination of a writer is always at work, which constantly inventes thousands of events, of episodes, that create his stories from nothing. </seg>
<seg id="2"> In fact, the opposite is true. </seg>
<seg id="3"> When people know you are a writer, they bring you stories and characters and as long as you keep your observing and listening skills attentive, these stories will continue to ... </seg>
<seg id="4"> Stop it. Stop it! No! Do not do it! </seg>
<seg id="5"> They will continue to find you throughout your life. </seg>
<seg id="6"> To those who have told other stories, many stories will be told. </seg>
<seg id="7"> - Sorry. - It's all OK. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The following events have been described exactly as I will present them and in a totally unexpected way. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Several years ago, suffering from a mild form of "Writer's Fever", a type of common neurastenia between the Intelligence of Time, I decided to spend the month of August in the spa town of Nebelsbad downstream of the Sudetenwaltz, and I stayed at the Grand Budapest , A picturesque, elaborate and well celebrated hotel. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Many of you will have heard of it. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It was in the low season, and at that time completely out of fashion, had already begun its decline towards squalor and possible demolition. </seg>
<seg id="12"> With the other few guests, we soon came to recognize each other as the only inhabitants of the vast building, although I do not remember there was any other confidences beyond the polite notes of the boss we exchanged encountering in the palm grove in Arab baths and at the funicular . </seg>
<seg id="13"> We were a very reserved group, it seemed, and lonely, with no exception. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Perhaps precisely because of this general silence, I found a familiar acquaintance with the concierge of the hotel, a Western Noto like Monsieur Jean, whose laziness hit me but, at the same time, great courtesy. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Suspicion was not at all well paid. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Anyway, one night, as I became conversant with Monsieur Jean, I noticed a new presence in the group. A gentle and old gentleman dressed elegantly with an exceptionally intelligent and lively face and a perceiving aura of sadness. </seg>
<seg id="17"> He was sitting alone, like all of us but I must say that he was the only one who really seemed deeply alone. </seg>
<seg id="18"> That was also a symptom of my medical condition. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Who is that old gentleman? I asked Monsieur Jean. </seg>
<seg id="20"> With my astonishment, he was taken aback. </seg>
<seg id="21"> - He does not know? - Churches. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Do not you recognize him? </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact it seemed familiar to me. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Mr. Moustafa is in person. </seg>
<seg id="25"> It came this morning. </seg>
<seg id="26"> This name will undoubtedly be familiar with the most elated of you. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Mr. Zero Moustafa was the richest man in Zubrowka and the owner of the Grand Budapest. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Comes often and stays here for a week or more, three times a year, never in high season. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Monsieur Jean made me sign and I came near. </seg>
<seg id="30"> I'll tell you a secret. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It always takes a single and no bath room in a corner of the top floor. It's smaller than the service lift! </seg>
<seg id="32"> He was well known, Zero Moustafa had bought and lived in some of the most sumptuous castles and palaces in the continent. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Yet here, in his half-empty hotel, was he occupying a dachshund? </seg>
<seg id="34"> At that moment, the curtain opened on a domestic drama ... Shit. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Which required the immediate and total attention of Monsieur jean, but who, in sincerity, did not capture mine for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Anyway, this intrusion in the story of the strange old man had left me, as it is said, "gespannt wie ein Flitzebogen", that is, on the thorns, and on the thorns I stayed all the following morning, until, in his usual manner of mysterious act And infallible, the fate once again moved to my place. </seg>
<seg id="37"> I admire her work. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Excuse me? </seg>
<seg id="39"> I said I know and admire her wonderful work. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Thank you very much, sir. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Monsieur Jean felt he would exchange a word or two about the senior owner of this building? I have to admit she asked her. Monsieur Jean is absolutely capable, of course, but one can not say he is a first class concierge, nor in honesty, even second. </seg>
<seg id="42"> But it does. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Times have changed. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The spa baths are really great. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Originally they were. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Obviously I could not keep them. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Too decadent for modern taste. </seg>
<seg id="48"> But I love her, too, these lovely old ruins. </seg>
<seg id="49"> How did you buy the Hotel, if I can ask? </seg>
<seg id="50"> The Grand Budapest. </seg>
<seg id="51"> I did not. </seg>
<seg id="52"> If you did not just ask for education, and please tell me if this is the case, but if this story seriously interests you, I invite you to dine with me tonight, and it will be my pleasure and honor to tell you "my story." As well as. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Two roasted ducks with olives. </seg>
<seg id="54"> Rabbit, salad? </seg>
<seg id="55"> '52 Poully-Jouvet and a quarter of brut's champagne bottle. </seg>
<seg id="56"> This should give us plenty of time - if I hesitate to get started. </seg>
<seg id="57"> - Of course. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Well, it starts with the predecessor of our common friend. </seg>
<seg id="59"> The beloved first concierge of the Grand Budapest. </seg>
<seg id="60"> Start with ... </seg>
<seg id="61"> - The table near the window. - Yes, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="62"> - The tray on the table. - Right away, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="63"> There. Those were brushed? </seg>
<seg id="64"> - Of course, Monsieur Gustave. - In the hoods. </seg>
<seg id="65"> - What about Oberstdorf & Co.? </seg>
<seg id="66"> - I think so, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="67"> - In the second trunk. Who has the tickets? - I, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Give them to me. </seg>
<seg id="69"> They're in order. Wait in the corner. </seg>
<seg id="70"> - I will not go anymore. </seg>
<seg id="71"> - How, excuse me? </seg>
<seg id="72"> - I will not go anymore. - Why not? </seg>
<seg id="73"> - I'm scared. - And what? </seg>
<seg id="74"> I'm afraid this may be the last time we see you. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Why should this be so? </seg>
<seg id="76"> Well, I can not explain it in words, but I hear it. </seg>
<seg id="77"> Divine goodness, there is no reason to leave if you are so ... </seg>
<seg id="78"> - Come with me. - In that lick of Lutz? </seg>
<seg id="79"> - Please. - Give me your hand. </seg>
<seg id="80"> It has nothing to fear. You're always a little anxious before you leave. </seg>
<seg id="81"> I admit that this time you are more than usual. </seg>
<seg id="82"> But, honestly ... Oh, Holy Heaven. </seg>
<seg id="83"> What did you do to your nails? </seg>
<seg id="84"> - How, excuse me? - This naughty nail polish. </seg>
<seg id="85"> - The color is completely wrong. - You do not like it? </seg>
<seg id="86"> It's not that I do not like it, it repels me physically. </seg>
<seg id="87"> - Maybe I know what can relax you. - Thing? No, do not play. </seg>
<seg id="88"> - Shh, listen to the words. - Please, not now. </seg>
<seg id="89"> "Ramingo, one night in a noble streak of cinereal sparrows of pines, I drifted into a frosty stone, misty rain, diaphanous, the inscription for a long time, almost seemed to be read in the nubile cracks ..." </seg>
<seg id="90"> Would you light a candle for me? </seg>
<seg id="91"> - In the sacristy of Santa Maria? </seg>
<seg id="92"> - I will personally cover myself. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Remember, I'll always be at your side. </seg>
<seg id="94"> - I love you. </seg>
<seg id="95"> - I love you. </seg>
<seg id="96"> It is not easy to earn a woman's devotion for 19 consecutive seasons. </seg>
<seg id="97"> - Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="98"> - I'm really fond of you, you know. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="100"> But I had never seen her so before. </seg>
<seg id="101"> No, sir. </seg>
<seg id="102"> It tore like a stitched dog. </seg>
<seg id="103"> Very true. </seg>
<seg id="104"> Drive to the Cathedral of Santa Maria in Brucknerplatz. </seg>
<seg id="105"> Buy a simple, medium length candle And take 4 Kubeck's rest. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Light it up in the sacristy, say a short rosary then go to Mendl and take a courtesan au chocolat. </seg>
<seg id="107"> If coins are being made, from the kid to the cripple shoeshine. </seg>
<seg id="108"> - Right away, sir. - Wait. </seg>
<seg id="109"> - Who are you? </seg>
<seg id="110"> - I'm Zero, sir. The new Lobby Boy. </seg>
<seg id="111"> - Zero, did you say that? - Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="112"> - I've never seen or heard you call. - Who has hired you? </seg>
<seg id="113"> Mr. Mosher, sir. - Mr. Mosher! </seg>
<seg id="114"> Yes, Monsieur Gustave? </seg>
<seg id="115"> It seems to me that you have clandestinely assumed this young man in the role of Lobby Boy. </seg>
<seg id="116"> He was hired for a trial period pending his consent. </seg>
<seg id="117"> Maybe yes. Thank you, Mr. Mosher. </seg>
<seg id="118"> It's a pleasure, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="119"> Now you will be officially interviewed. Do I have to go first to turn on that jar, sir? </seg>
<seg id="120"> Thing? No. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Experience? </seg>
<seg id="122"> Hotel Kinski, garzone, six months. </seg>
<seg id="123"> Hotel Berlitz, servant, three months. </seg>
<seg id="124"> - Before it was even disheveled ... - Experience: zero. </seg>
<seg id="125"> - Thanks again, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="126"> - Straighten that cap, Anatole. </seg>
<seg id="127"> - Pleasure is mine, Herr Schneider. - The strap is broken. </seg>
<seg id="128"> - These are unacceptable. - I totally agree. </seg>
<seg id="129"> - Education? - I studied reading and writing. </seg>
<seg id="130"> I started elementary schools. I have almost... </seg>
<seg id="131"> - Education: zero. - This time it exploded. </seg>
<seg id="132"> Good day, Cicero. Call a damned plumber! </seg>
<seg id="133"> - This afternoon, Monsieur Gustave? </seg>
<seg id="134"> - No doubt, Frau Liebling. </seg>
<seg id="135"> - What the hell is this? - Not now. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Family? </seg>
<seg id="137"> Zero. </seg>
<seg id="138"> Sixth, Igor. </seg>
<seg id="139"> Why do you want to be a Lobby Boy? </seg>
<seg id="140"> Well, who would not want to be at Grand Budapest, sir? </seg>
<seg id="141"> It's an institution. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Very well. </seg>
<seg id="143"> - Mille Klubeck. - My goodness. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Have you ever been a Lobby Boy, sir? </seg>
<seg id="145"> What do you believe? </seg>
<seg id="146"> Well, I guess you should have started somehow ... </seg>
<seg id="147"> - Go to turn on that damned crier. - Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="148"> And so, he started my life. </seg>
<seg id="149"> Aspiring Junior Lobby Boy, Grand Budapest Hotel, under the strict command of Monsieur Gustave H. </seg>
<seg id="150"> I became his pupil, and he was my guardian and supervisor. What is a Lobby Boy? </seg>
<seg id="151"> A Lobby Boy is completely invisible but always under eye. A Lobby Boy remembers what customers hate. A Lobby Boy anticipates customer needs even before they need it. </seg>
<seg id="152"> A Lobby Boy is, above all, discreet to the unlikely. Our guests know that their deeper secrets, some of which, frankly, rather inadequate, will bring them with us to the grave. - So keep your mouth shut, Zero. - Yes, sir. </seg>
<seg id="153"> It's all for now. </seg>
<seg id="154"> I began to realize that many of the hotel's most esteemed and distinguished guests came for him. He seemed to be an essential part of his duties. </seg>
<seg id="155"> ... But I think it was also a pleasure. The requirements were always the same. </seg>
<seg id="156"> They had to be rich, deprived, insecure, vanity, superficial, blond, needy for attention. Why are you blonde? </seg>
<seg id="157"> Because they were all. He was, moreover, the most generously fragrant man I ever met. The fragrance announced its arrival far away. And persisted for long minutes when he left. I worked six days a week, half a day on Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="158"> Our meals were poor but frequent, to withstand better. Two breakfasts, two lunches and a night meal. Monsieur Gustave also held a daily talk. Rudeness is a mere expression of fear. </seg>
<seg id="159"> People are afraid not to get what they want. The most unpleasant and horrible person just needs to be loved, and it will open like a flower. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A verse goes with me: "The paintbrush's brush kissed that young niffle" with his agile bristles "and with his pompous sweetness, he restored his empty goats." </seg>
<seg id="161"> He consumed his dinner alone in his room. </seg>
<seg id="162"> The hotel owner's identity was unknown to us all. </seg>
<seg id="163"> Every month his emissary, known as Vice Kovacs, came to check the records and communicate messages on behalf of the mysterious owner. </seg>
<seg id="164"> On these occasions, Monsieur Gustave and our trade manager, Herr Becker, met him privately over the Reception. </seg>
<seg id="165"> It was then that I met Agatha, but we will not talk about it. - What do you want? - Look. </seg>
<seg id="166"> Good God. </seg>
<seg id="167"> I'm sorry, sir. </seg>
<seg id="168"> - We have to go to her. - We have to? </seg>
<seg id="169"> Tout de suite. You need me, and I need you for the bags and so on. </seg>
<seg id="170"> - How can you crawl out? - 5 minutes. </seg>
<seg id="171"> Just do it. And she puts a bottle of Pouilly-Jouvet in '26 in a bucket of ice with two glasses So there will not be any drink of cat's piss in the carriage restaurant. </seg>
<seg id="172"> It's all my fault. He tried to tell me about his premonition. I did not hear it. The whole Lutz will be in mourning, except for his false, demonic children whom he hated and could not bear kissing on his cheek. They will dance like gypsies. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Nothing really makes sense in life, since it can end all from one moment to the next ... </seg>
<seg id="174"> And immediately afterwards, comes the rigor mortis. Oh, the best always die young. </seg>
<seg id="175"> With a little luck, he left some Klubeck to your old friend, but you never know until the ink on the death certificate is dry. </seg>
<seg id="176"> It was a bed-bomb, among other things. </seg>
<seg id="177"> He was 84, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="178"> I had older ones. </seg>
<seg id="179"> As young people, they all point to the fillet and the lettuce, but over the years, you have to move on less valuable cuts, which is fine to me because they prefer them. They are more flavorful, or so they say. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Why are we stuck in a barley field? </seg>
<seg id="181"> Hey, hello, folks. Documents. With pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="182"> The photo does not honor me, I'm afraid. I was considered a very nice man. </seg>
<seg id="183"> What's the "F" for? Fritz? Franz? </seg>
<seg id="184"> - Franz. - I knew it! </seg>
<seg id="185"> He's making a grimace. </seg>
<seg id="186"> It's a residence permit with a third-tier employee status, my dear Franz. </seg>
<seg id="187"> And with me. </seg>
<seg id="188"> Come on, please. </seg>
<seg id="189"> Wait a minute. Sit down, Zero. His visas are in order. </seg>
<seg id="190"> I personally checked them with the Bureau of Labor and Servitude. </seg>
<seg id="191"> He can not stop him just because he's a damned immigrant. </seg>
<seg id="192"> He did nothing. </seg>
<seg id="193"> Stop it, damn it! </seg>
<seg id="194"> No matter, Monsieur Gustave! Let them do it! </seg>
<seg id="195"> Ow! Ouch! </seg>
<seg id="196"> Damned, Dirty, Disgusting Fascist beasts! </seg>
<seg id="197"> Keep your hands down from my Lobby Boy! </seg>
<seg id="198"> What's the problem? </seg>
<seg id="199"> All this is shameful. </seg>
<seg id="200"> This young man works for me at the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad. </seg>
<seg id="201"> Monsieur Gustave? </seg>
<seg id="202"> My name is Henckels. </seg>
<seg id="203"> I am the son of Dr. Wolfgang Henckels-Bergersdofer. Do you remember me? I know perfectly well who you are. It's incredible. You are the little Albert. I'm terribly embarrassed. Free them. Free them. </seg>
<seg id="204"> Your colleague is stateless. He has to ask for a review of the Special Transit Permit, which at this point could be very difficult to obtain. Take this. </seg>
<seg id="205"> It's time-consuming, but I'm afraid it's the maximum I can do. How is her beautiful mother? - Very well, thank you. - I love it. - Greetings warmly. - I will do it. </seg>
<seg id="206"> His traveling companion was kind as I was when I was a sad child. </seg>
<seg id="207"> My men and I apologize for bothering you. I beg your pardon, sir. </seg>
<seg id="208"> See? There are still dull glories of civilization in this wild slaughterhouse that we call humanity. </seg>
<seg id="209"> It is exactly what we represent in our humble, insignificant ... </seg>
<seg id="210"> Oh, but I'm screaming. </seg>
<seg id="211"> Where is Clotilde? Bring me to her. You're so beautiful, my dear. Really. They did a great job. </seg>
<seg id="212"> I do not know what products they used there in the morgue, but I also want a little. In sincerity, you are better than it has been in recent years. You seem almost alive. </seg>
<seg id="213"> Oh, you changed her in the end. It's perfect. - Clotilde? - Oui, Monsieur Gustave? </seg>
<seg id="214"> A glass of cold water, no ice, for pleasure Ah. All right. </seg>
<seg id="215"> I will not get much, dear. We escorted through a green cloth door, into a narrow service corridor and into the pantry. </seg>
<seg id="216"> An instant later, the kitchen door opened and a minute white dressed robbery glittered. I never forgot the expression on her face. What the hell is going on? </seg>
<seg id="217"> I had never set foot in a home like that in my life. </seg>
<seg id="218"> I knew very little about the subsequent events. </seg>
<seg id="219"> But at some point I knew that when the fate of a great fortune is in the dance, greed goes into the veins like a poison. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Uncles, grandchildren, cousins, relatives of ever-weaker relatives. The faraway family of the old woman came out like cockroaches in search of food. </seg>
<seg id="221"> At the head of that congregation, incredible coincidence, We found our Vice Kovacs, himself an important notary. </seg>
<seg id="222"> He was the executor of the widow's will. This is Madame D.'s will. </seg>
<seg id="223"> It consists of a document written before the death of her husband 46 years ago, and 635 amendments, notes, corrections and letters of intent. Added over the next decades. </seg>
<seg id="224"> The definitive legitimacy of this collection requires further analysis, but in the view of this office, Madame D's intention was to control the majority of his inheritance being transferred to his son, Dmitri, with special diaries for his sisters , Marguerite, Laetitia and Carolina, giving smaller gifts to several members of the extended family as indicated in the Beneficiaries List, which I will read in due course. </seg>
<seg id="225"> Nevertheless. An additional code, which I received by mail only this morning, and without any doubt, sent by Madame D in her last hours of life, contains an amendment to the original certificate, which, as prescribed by law, I will read you now . </seg>
<seg id="226"> The authenticity of this document has not yet been confirmed by the competent court, so I ask all parties to be patient and keep the comments until the necessary investigations are completed. </seg>
<seg id="227"> "To my esteemed friend who has comforted me in my last years" and brought a ray of sunshine to an old woman's life, "which he believed would never be more happy. </seg>
<seg id="228"> "Monsieur Gustave H," I leave in inheritance, net of all taxes "and with full and absolute trusteeship," the painting known as "Boy with apple" ... - Wow! - "... by Johannes van Hoytl ... </seg>
<seg id="229"> - I can not believe. - "... son ..." "What?" "That gave both of them so much pleasure." </seg>
<seg id="230"> Does van Hoytl? - Esentasse? - But can he do that? Who is Gustave H? </seg>
<seg id="231"> I'm afraid I'm dear. That fucking cock! It's a hotel doorkeeper. What's he doing here? I came to bring my homage to a great woman I loved. </seg>
<seg id="232"> - This man is an intruder in my house! - It's not yours yet, Dmitri. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Missing Authentication, and Donation Act ... </seg>
<seg id="234"> You will not have Boy with Apple, damn checca! </seg>
<seg id="235"> And how should this make me feel? </seg>
<seg id="236"> Call the police. We dispute denunciation. </seg>
<seg id="237"> This criminal has afflicted my family for nearly 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="238"> He is a ruthless adventurer and a swindler who plagues old, sick and psychic women. And probably if she fucks her too! </seg>
<seg id="239"> I go to bed with all my friends. Where's Celine? </seg>
<seg id="240"> Thing? She's dead. We are reading his will. </seg>
<seg id="241"> Oh, yes, yes, clear. </seg>
<seg id="242"> If I find out that you have ever touched my mother's body, alive or dead, I swear to God that I cut my throat? I got it? </seg>
<seg id="243"> I thought I'd say I'm a fucking cock. - You are, but you are bisexual. - Let's change subject. I go away. </seg>
<seg id="244"> That painting, Boy with Apple, has no price. I got it? Congratulations, Monsieur Gustave! </seg>
<seg id="245"> They'll make me a war, you fucking bitch. - It's very beautiful? - Beyond every word. </seg>
<seg id="246"> "Finance the Right Bard Can not Sing" That Its Missing And All That Is Not! - "His speech can not ..." - Can I see it? I do not see why not. </seg>
<seg id="247"> This is the gorgeous portrait that Van Hoytl makes of a magnificent boy on the brink of maturity. Blond, refined. White skin like milk. </seg>
<seg id="248"> Of unmatched origin. One of the last in private hands, and no doubt the best. It's a masterpiece. </seg>
<seg id="249"> The rest of the stuff is worthless hooves. </seg>
<seg id="250"> What did he want to tell me first? I do not think I can say it now. </seg>
<seg id="251"> Write me tomorrow. Lutzbahn Station! I will never separate. She remembered them. She'll remember me. Forever. I will die with this picture over my bed. See the similarity? Oh yes. In fact we should sell it. </seg>
<seg id="252"> The sooner is, the better, if they try to steal them in turn. Also, those psychopathic soldiers on the train ... </seg>
<seg id="253"> This could be a difficult war and a long lease of the hotel. For what we know, they could shut up tomorrow. Let's make a solemn covenant of blood. </seg>
<seg id="254"> We contact the black market and sell Boy with Apple by week, then leave the country and hide somewhere along the Maltese Riviera until the storm is over and we will be able to resume our jobs. </seg>
<seg id="255"> In exchange for your help, your loyalty and your service as my personal valet, I promise you 1.5% of the sale price. </seg>
<seg id="256"> - Can we not make 10%? - 10%? Do you fool me? It's more than I owe a real art merchant, and you would not distinguish a chiaroscuro from a bunch of chicken meat. </seg>
<seg id="257"> No, 1.5 is right. But you can hear me: if I die first, and it will surely be so, you will be my only heir. There is not much in the dish except for a set of ivory brushes and my collection of romantic poetry, but when it is time yours will be all along with everything we do not spend in whiskey and prostitutes. This is our sacred covenant. I redesign it instantly. </seg>
<seg id="258"> I, Monsieur Gustave H, relatively capable of understanding, today, October 19, in the year of the Lord 1932 ... </seg>
<seg id="259"> He never told me where to come from. I never wondered where his family was. Excuse me. </seg>
<seg id="260"> There is the police. They ask for her. Tell them to come right away. Okay. </seg>
<seg id="261"> Have you ever been questioned by the authorities? Yes, I was once detained and tortured by rebel militias after the Desert Insurrection. </seg>
<seg id="262"> - You know how it works, then. Shut up. - Sure. You have never heard the word "van Hoytl" in your life. Okay, let's go. How can I help you? Ah, Inspector Henckels. </seg>
<seg id="263"> "By order of the Police Commissioner of the Zubrowka Province," I am arrested for the murder "by Madame Ceine Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis." </seg>
<seg id="264"> I knew there was something suspicious. We did not have the cause of death. She was killed and you believe it was me. </seg>
<seg id="265"> Hey! </seg>
<seg id="266"> Stop! </seg>
<seg id="267"> What happened? </seg>
<seg id="268"> My dear Zero has happened, that I made an ass like a whacky freak called Pinky Bandinski who had the daring to question my virility, because if there is one thing that we learned from appendix novels, Is that when you're in a place like this, you never have to be a girl. </seg>
<seg id="269"> You have to show yourself up right from the first moment. You have to earn their respect. You should see her growl grumpy. In fact, he became a dear friend. You will know it, I hope. </seg>
<seg id="270"> So. Did you talk to Kovacs? </seg>
<seg id="271"> I saw him last night, secretly. </seg>
<seg id="272"> He made me swear in a Bible that I would not tell anyone. </seg>
<seg id="273"> - You must do it too. - I'll do it later. </seg>
<seg id="274"> - You suspect you're innocent. - Obviously. </seg>
<seg id="275"> What is the charge? </seg>
<seg id="276"> At the small hours of the evening of October 19th, </seg>
<seg id="277"> A man known as Monsieur Gustave H, came to the residence of the Desgoffe und Taxis in Lutz and entered the service door without being seen by anyone, </seg>
<seg id="278"> Proceeding for the service staircase and the hallway of the servitude, he entered the private rooms of Madame D. There is no evidence to indicate whether the visit was agreed with her or not. </seg>
<seg id="279"> The following morning, Madame D was found dead for stinging poisoning. Monsieur Gustave was no longer seen in the building until 24 hours later. </seg>
<seg id="280"> The identity of the accusers is explicit in the documents filed. </seg>
<seg id="281"> These include, essentially, all members of the extended family, but the key witness, who seems to have seen the alleged events, seems to have left jurisdiction. Its position is unknown at the moment, but the competent authorities continue to search. </seg>
<seg id="282"> Who is it? </seg>
<seg id="283"> - Serge? - I'm afraid of that. </seg>
<seg id="284"> That bastard. </seg>
<seg id="285"> No I do not believe it. They forced him. I've been in a viper's nest. Do you have an alibi? </seg>
<seg id="286"> Sure, but he is married to the Duke of Westphalia. </seg>
<seg id="287"> I can not allow her name to be contaminated by these dirty business. </seg>
<seg id="288"> - It's a matter of life or death. - I know, but that bastard if it is shaken. </seg>
<seg id="289"> He is already aboard Queen Nasstasja, towards the Dutch Tanganyka. Not soft. </seg>
<seg id="290"> The details of the conspiracy, now of public dominance, were at times unpredictable for us. I am looking for Serge X, a man at the service of my employers, the Desgoffe und Taxis family of Schloss Lutz. </seg>
<seg id="291"> - Yes, sir? - And his sister? </seg>
<seg id="292"> - Yes, sir. - Have you seen him recently? </seg>
<seg id="293"> - No, sir. - Nossignore? </seg>
<seg id="294"> - No, yes. </seg>
<seg id="295"> I have to find it as soon as possible, for her and everyone else's good. </seg>
<seg id="296"> If you see ... </seg>
<seg id="297"> - Yes, sir? - Tell him that Jopling said, </seg>
<seg id="298"> "Back home." </seg>
<seg id="299"> But one thing was certain, Desfogge und Taxis were a very powerful family, and time was not for our benefit. </seg>
<seg id="300"> A letter from Monsieur Gustave. Zero. </seg>
<seg id="301"> - You want me ... - Read it. </seg>
<seg id="302"> "My dear and trusted colleagues ..." </seg>
<seg id="303"> I miss you while I write you from the chains of my unpleasant and mindless imprisonment. </seg>
<seg id="304"> Until I am again free to be among you, Grand Budapest is in your hands, as well as its impeccable reputation. </seg>
<seg id="305"> Immaculate and honored mantle. </seg>
<seg id="306"> Be cautious of his tiniest piece as if you were looking from above like a hawk with a whip between claws, because that's what I do. </seg>
<seg id="307"> I must find a lack of any kind during my absence, I swear that justice will fall on you, quick and ruthless. A great and noble house has been placed under your protection. Tell Zero any strangeness. </seg>
<seg id="308"> "Your devout Monsieur Gustave." </seg>
<seg id="309"> Then there is a poem, but maybe it's best to start the soup since there are 46 verses. </seg>
<seg id="310"> "A rude black ash insects the deer of a rat's dagger" and mixes with dense effusions of marbling wood "while the chanting of a troglodyte ..." </seg>
<seg id="311"> I never trusted that butler. </seg>
<seg id="312"> - It's too honest. - Too honest, you say? </seg>
<seg id="313"> Well, as it is, I find it quickly and solve it. </seg>
<seg id="314"> Can I offer you a soup dish? </seg>
<seg id="315"> No? Nobody? </seg>
<seg id="316"> You, with the big scar on your face? </seg>
<seg id="317"> Try it. It is very warm and nutritious this evening. It takes a pinch of salt. Good day. </seg>
<seg id="318"> Mushroom, gentlemen? Who wants it? </seg>
<seg id="319"> I say good. It's time to get up, hop, hop. Good morning, Pinky. </seg>
<seg id="320"> - Again, Mendl? - That's right. </seg>
<seg id="321"> Who has the cutter blade? - On another planet. - Mendl is the best. </seg>
<seg id="322"> - Well, at work. - Monsieur Gustave? Yup? </seg>
<seg id="323"> I and the guys discussed it. We believe you are a really good guy. Well, I've never been blamed for so much, but I appreciate the intention. </seg>
<seg id="324"> She is one of us now. What a nice thing to say. Thank you, dear Pinky. Thank you, Gunther. Thank you, Wolf. Anything else? Tell him, Ludwig. </seg>
<seg id="325"> The Checkpoint 19 is not a two-money gang. There are thick iron bars at each door, vent and window. There are 72 guards on the plane, and another 16 in the towers. There is a 100-meter jump in a moat full of crocodiles. But like all prisons, it has a weak point, which in this case has the shape of a sewerage system constructed at the time of the first fortification of this fort in the distant Middle Ages. </seg>
<seg id="326"> Now, no one says it's a walk along a tree-lined avenue with an elegant woman and a white poodle, but it's what's called "vulnerability," and this is our daily bread. </seg>
<seg id="327"> Look. Who designed it? What do you mean? I designed it. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Beautiful, you have a wonderful trait, Ludwig. You have a huge artistic talent. Question: How do you intend to penetrate these foundations? They are 60cm reinforced granite masonry, right? Digging with the cutter blade, I guess it takes us three to six months of continuous engagement, during which many of our members will be violently executed. </seg>
<seg id="329"> He hit the sign, Mr. Gustave. We have fake documents, second-hand civilian clothes, a rope ladder made with staves and sheets, but we need digging tools, which are hard to find in this crap. At this point in the story, the Man was suddenly silent and removed his lambskin shoulder. </seg>
<seg id="330"> His eyes darkened like a stormy sky. It was obviously difficult. </seg>
<seg id="331"> - Are you okay, Mr. Moustafa? - I decided to ask him. - No, my dear, at all. - He answered. </seg>
<seg id="332"> It's just that I do not know how to go on. He was crying. </seg>
<seg id="333"> You see, I never talk about Agatha, because only the thought of her name loses control of my emotions. Well, I guess it's useless to turn around. </seg>
<seg id="334"> You see, she saved us. On the day of our third appointment, I asked her hand, and she agreed. </seg>
<seg id="335"> - Do you want to marry me? - Yup. </seg>
<seg id="336"> We did not even have 50 Klubeck in two. Nobody knew, of course, but who would it be? We were both all alone in the world, and we were madly in love. </seg>
<seg id="337"> - Here it is. - Thank you. - It's a book. - I see. </seg>
<seg id="338"> Romantic Poetry, Volume I. Recommended by Monsieur Gustave. I also have a copy of it. - I ruined the surprise, I imagine. - I'll open it anyway. Read the dedication. </seg>
<seg id="339"> Monsieur Gustave kept us in an immediate and scrupulous cross-examination. </seg>
<seg id="340"> Is enchanting. Absolutely lovely. ... during which she gave Agatha a porcelain pendant and five dozen white tulips in a box of the size of a baby coffin. </seg>
<seg id="341"> - He does not feel good. - How, excuse me? </seg>
<seg id="342"> Why is he jealous? She is my girlfriend. She can not give her gifts. I'm just asking a few questions about this delightful view on your own. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Never be jealous, Zero, not even for a moment. Are you trying with us? </seg>
<seg id="344"> - Yes. - I approve this union. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Agatha, honey, come back to your beloved. Soon we discovered ... </seg>
<seg id="346"> I wish you all the good. That Agatha was not just phenomenal with the dough spatula and the cream seals ... </seg>
<seg id="347"> - Mendl. - Go. </seg>
<seg id="348"> But that was also incredibly brave. </seg>
<seg id="349"> I think we were born. Something is missing. A crucial, lost or most likely destroyed document- I do not know what it is, I do not know what it represents, I do not know what it is, but there are traces everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="350"> Now, I do not want to alarm her, and I'm not looking to see significant changes in the magistrates' decisions about her legacy, but above all given the circumstances of her death, and the disappearance of the key witness of the murder, Serge X. I suggest bringing this Case to the attention of the municipal inspector so that there is no doubt in the future about the legitimacy of the verdict. </seg>
<seg id="351"> - Agree? - Do not agree. - Do not agree? - Do not agree. - May I ask you a question, Vilmos? - Of course, Dmitri. - Who do you work for? - How do you say? Who do you work for? I thought you were our lawyer. Well, technically I'm the performer of the will. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In this situation, I represent the deceased. Oh yes? Yes. Payment for my services was included in ... Put things in place and do not create problems, okay? </seg>
<seg id="353"> I'm a notary. I am obliged to act according to law. Do not agree. This thing stinks, sisters. Did my cat knock out the window? I do not think so. - No, did not you do it? - Who, Jopling? Okay. </seg>
<seg id="354"> There's something I did not tell you, Agatha. - Okay. - We stole a picture. It is very precious, perhaps 5 million of Klubeck, in fact. I do not know if they have noticed theft but if something happens to me ... Rubi's artwork? </seg>
<seg id="355"> Just one picture. However, we must have a plan for your survival. Keep this. It's code and you will need a lens to read it, it's written exactly where and how to find Boy with Apple. Do not accept less than half the sale price. Furthermore... </seg>
<seg id="356"> - Zero, I'm a fornaia. - You're a baker. I'm not a recipe, that's the point. I do not sell stolen items. I said that badly. She wanted him to have him. Go to sleep. Yes, Herr Mendl. </seg>
<seg id="357"> - Keep it. - No. </seg>
<seg id="358"> Okay, but take the same. The following day, Herr Becker received a strange news last hour from the office of Vice Kovacs, who sent the planned appointment forever. </seg>
<seg id="359"> Let's get out. </seg>
<seg id="360"> - What are you doing out there? - Close that sewer. </seg>
<seg id="361"> These are here trying to run away. </seg>
<seg id="362"> What the hell is that gonna do to you, a wicked spy? </seg>
<seg id="363"> Guards! Guards! </seg>
<seg id="364"> It is you. Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Thanks, gentle, kind friend. </seg>
<seg id="366"> Okay. </seg>
<seg id="367"> I think you can call a draw. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Good evening. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Let me present you. Pinky, Wolf, Ludwig, this is the divine Zero. </seg>
<seg id="370"> Gunther was killed in the catacombs. </seg>
<seg id="371"> Well, guys, who knows when we will meet again, but if one day ... </seg>
<seg id="372"> Wait. </seg>
<seg id="373"> There is no time for the talk. </seg>
<seg id="374"> Take care of her, Mr. Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="375"> Good luck, boy. </seg>
<seg id="376"> - Where is the refuge? - I did not find it. </seg>
<seg id="377"> No shelter? Seriously? Are we alone out here? </seg>
<seg id="378"> I'm afraid of yes. I asked around, but ... </seg>
<seg id="379"> I see. Too risky. I guess we'll have to improvise. </seg>
<seg id="380"> Let's put on the disguises. </seg>
<seg id="381"> - We already have them. - Not at all. </seg>
<seg id="382"> He had said, fake mustache, fake beard, and so on. </seg>
<seg id="383"> - Did not you bring anything? - I thought you would have grown up. </seg>
<seg id="384"> And it would not have seemed realistic, right? </seg>
<seg id="385"> When they are done well, they are perfectly convincing. </seg>
<seg id="386"> But I understand. That's right. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Give me some Air de Panache spray, please. </seg>
<seg id="388"> - Can I have a splash? - I forgot the Air de Panache. </seg>
<seg id="389"> Have you really forgot the Air de Panache? </seg>
<seg id="390"> Do not believe it, how could you? </seg>
<seg id="391"> I've been in jail, Zero! Can you imagine how humiliating it is? </seg>
<seg id="392"> Puzzo. </seg>
<seg id="393"> Wonderful, right? </seg>
<seg id="394"> I guess I can not wait for better ... where are you from? </seg>
<seg id="395"> - Salim al-Jabat. - That's right. </seg>
<seg id="396"> I guess I can not wait for better at Salim al-Jabat where the most precious personal belongings are a stack of dusty carpets and a hungry goat hungry, and sleeping under a tent trying to survive the scenes. </seg>
<seg id="397"> But that's not how I trained you. </seg>
<seg id="398"> What demon possessed you by persuading you to leave the land that you so obviously have and to walk unusual distances to become a dead immigrant starving in a cultivated and refined society that in all honesty could quietly do without you? </seg>
<seg id="399"> War. </seg>
<seg id="400"> How do you say? </seg>
<seg id="401"> Well, you see, my dad was murdered and the rest of my family executed by a platoon. Our village was razed to the ground and the survivors were forced to flee. </seg>
<seg id="402"> I left because of the war. </seg>
<seg id="403"> I see. So you're more of a political refugee, right? </seg>
<seg id="404"> Right. </seg>
<seg id="405"> Well, I suppose I have to keep up everything I said. What stupid idiot I am. A pathetic idiot. </seg>
<seg id="406"> God, that selfish bastard. </seg>
<seg id="407"> This is shameful, and is well below the standards of Grand Budapest. I apologize for the name of the hotel. </seg>
<seg id="408"> It is not his fault. He was just angry because I forgot the perfume. It's not a justification. I need you to live. </seg>
<seg id="409"> You are a dear and protected friend and I am proud of you. </seg>
<seg id="410"> You have to keep it in mind. </seg>
<seg id="411"> I'm desolate, Zero. </seg>
<seg id="412"> We are brothers. </seg>
<seg id="413"> How is our dear Agatha? </seg>
<seg id="414"> "It was at the dawn that you had your semblance in the moon," and then I returned to every dawn, mesmerized, "by the vice that was on my chest, for ever ..." </seg>
<seg id="415"> Very well. I stop here because the alarm is ringing, but remember where you came because I would insist that you continue later. </seg>
<seg id="416"> I want block posts at every intersection within 50km. </seg>
<seg id="417"> Block trains at each station within 100km. </seg>
<seg id="418"> I want 50 men and 10 hounds ready in 5 minutes. Let us perceive every Pretzel-Haus, Waffel-hut, Biergarten and above all every Grand Hotel from Augenzburg to Zilchbrock. </seg>
<seg id="419"> Those men are dangerous professional criminals. Or at least three of them. </seg>
<seg id="420"> Who are you? </seg>
<seg id="421"> What's he doing here? Civilians are forbidden access to cells. - This is a military investigation. - It's Mr. Jopling, sir. The mother of her employer was one of the victims ... </seg>
<seg id="422"> Hush. </seg>
<seg id="423"> Desgoffe und Taxis family jobs? </seg>
<seg id="424"> Are you aware of the murder of Vice Vilmos Kovacs on October 23? </seg>
<seg id="425"> I am aware of his disappearance. </seg>
<seg id="426"> His corpse was found in a sarcophagus behind a litter box at the late-night Kunstmuseum. </seg>
<seg id="427"> She missed four fingers. </seg>
<seg id="428"> - What do you know about this? - Anything. </seg>
<seg id="429"> Scare Mr. Jopling out of the building. </seg>
<seg id="430"> Mendl. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Central Station, I walk to the Excelsion Palace in Baden-Jurgen, called at the recipient's expense. </seg>
<seg id="432"> We have no choice. We can not do anything else. </seg>
<seg id="433"> Wait, thank you. </seg>
<seg id="434"> It was not our only hope, I would not even have to tell you about her existence. </seg>
<seg id="435"> It is understood that you will never have to talk to a living soul. </seg>
<seg id="436"> - Jury? - Sure. But what is it? </seg>
<seg id="437"> I can not tell you. </seg>
<seg id="438"> How do you find two front row armchairs in the gallery for a first at the Tuscan Opera with one day notice? </seg>
<seg id="439"> How do you arrange a private viewing of the tapestry collection at the Royal Saxon Gallery? </seg>
<seg id="440"> How do you book a corner table at Chez Dominique on Thursday night? </seg>
<seg id="441"> Ivan, dear, are Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="442"> Well, I was up to about 5 minutes ago. </seg>
<seg id="443"> We took the responsibility to go away earlier, if so. </seg>
<seg id="444"> Well, through the sewers. Exactly. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Listen, Ivan, I'm sorry to interrupt it, but we're in trouble. </seg>
<seg id="446"> It's an official request. </seg>
<seg id="447"> I formally request the services of the ... </seg>
<seg id="448"> The call, Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="449"> Good. Attendia </seg>
<seg id="450"> Do you forgive me. Do you prefer to go on foot? </seg>
<seg id="451"> We are here. It's very simple. </seg>
<seg id="452"> Down on the ledge, then on the left. </seg>
<seg id="453"> Jojo, accompany the gentleman to the door. </seg>
<seg id="454"> Take me to Monsieur Georges of Chateau Luxe, please. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Up, damn it, higher up! </seg>
<seg id="456"> Go on. </seg>
<seg id="457"> - Monsieur Georges. - Above. </seg>
<seg id="458"> I see. Immediately. </seg>
<seg id="459"> I take Monsieur Robin from Hotel Côte du Cap, please. ... two and three. </seg>
<seg id="460"> Monsieur Robin. There is a call for her by Monsieur Dino. </seg>
<seg id="461"> Go on. </seg>
<seg id="462"> - One, two and three. - Yes, Dino. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Yes, Dino. Okay, Dino. </seg>
<seg id="464"> I walk Monsieur Martin of the Ritz Imperial, please. </seg>
<seg id="465"> Too much salt. </seg>
<seg id="466"> Too little pepper. </seg>
<seg id="467"> Go on. </seg>
<seg id="468"> - Robin? I'm Martin. - Too much salt. </seg>
<seg id="469"> I heard it, yes. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Maybe. I make some calls. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Serge X, gone. Vice Kovacs, he also disappeared. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Madame D, dead. Boy with Apple, stolen, from us. </seg>
<seg id="473"> Dmitry and Jopling, barbaric ruthless unscrupulous. </seg>
<seg id="474"> Gustave H, latitante. What else? </seg>
<seg id="475"> - Zero, confused. - Zero, confused, of course. </seg>
<seg id="476"> The plot wraps up, as they say. </seg>
<seg id="477"> Why, then? Is it a forest metaphor? </seg>
<seg id="478"> I do not know. </seg>
<seg id="479"> Revenue. </seg>
<seg id="480"> We found the butler. </seg>
<seg id="481"> It is hidden on the remote slope at Gabelmeister Peak. </seg>
<seg id="482"> Our contact has convinced her to meet you tomorrow at noon. </seg>
<seg id="483"> At the observatory on the top. </seg>
<seg id="484"> Do not tell anyone. It will explain everything to you. </seg>
<seg id="485"> Your train starts in 4 and a half minutes. </seg>
<seg id="486"> Here are the tickets. </seg>
<seg id="487"> - Third class? - She was overcrowded </seg>
<seg id="488"> But the ticket was sommelier to Old Versailles. </seg>
<seg id="489"> He advised you. </seg>
<seg id="490"> You will need these for the carriage wagon. </seg>
<seg id="491"> One last thing. </seg>
<seg id="492"> The Air de Penache. </seg>
<seg id="493"> They only had it half an ounce. </seg>
<seg id="494"> We have to offer him something like symbolic gesture. </seg>
<seg id="495"> - How much money do you have? - 42 Klubeck and 3 stamps. </seg>
<seg id="496"> Dame 25. Su. </seg>
<seg id="497"> - Thanks a lot. - Please. </seg>
<seg id="498"> - I have to admit it was good. - Jesus Christ. </seg>
<seg id="499"> I did not expect it. Well, what do you want me to do now? </seg>
<seg id="500"> Talk to your sister again, and you're convincing this time. </seg>
<seg id="501"> Damn son of a bitch. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Christ on the Cross! </seg>
<seg id="503"> What the fuck does that mean? </seg>
<seg id="504"> Boy with Apple? I thought I had hidden it. </seg>
<seg id="505"> - Why do you only notice it now? - I thought I was looking at an expert. </seg>
<seg id="506"> Are you taking me for the ass? </seg>
<seg id="507"> I think it was taken by Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="508"> I'm not angry with Serge. </seg>
<seg id="509"> You can not take it with someone for the total lack of moral fiber. </seg>
<seg id="510"> He is a small, scary, cowardly coward. </seg>
<seg id="511"> - It's not your fault, right? - I do not know. It depends. </seg>
<seg id="512"> Well, you can say anything. </seg>
<seg id="513"> "It depends". Of course it depends. </seg>
<seg id="514"> "Of course that depends," of course it depends. </seg>
<seg id="515"> Yes, I think you are right. Obviously it depends. </seg>
<seg id="516"> This does not mean I will not pull out that small sewage mud. </seg>
<seg id="517"> Anyway, can I marry you? Celebrate the wedding? </seg>
<seg id="518"> With pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="519"> I must say that I find that girl absolutely delicious. </seg>
<seg id="520"> Plain like a table, with that huge Mexico-like desire on his face, to sweat for hours and hours in that daring cooking, while Mendl, by genius, hangs over her like a clumsy gorilla. Yet without a doubt, without a subject of error, you are always and incredibly delightful. </seg>
<seg id="521"> Because? </seg>
<seg id="522"> For its purity. </seg>
<seg id="523"> She admires her, too, Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="524"> - Really? - Very. </seg>
<seg id="525"> It's a good sign, you know. It means he understands it. </seg>
<seg id="526"> It's important. </seg>
<seg id="527"> Do not try it with her. A telegram was personally delivered to the girl at 4. The envelope was close to the corpse, but the contents were not there. </seg>
<seg id="528"> In any case, the telegraphic office holds a copy of the tapes for 24 hours. I copied it, and here it is: "Do the suitcases, stop. </seg>
<seg id="529"> "Be ready to go at any time, stop." The hideout is at Gabelmeister Peak, stop. "Destroy this message, with affection, stop." </seg>
<seg id="530"> Where's the basket? Why, from this point, sir? Wake? Going to the sled? Climbs? </seg>
<seg id="531"> By express courier, I wrote to Agatha telling her to reach us at our hiding place. A Gypsy field somewhat out of Nebelsbad, while I and Monsieur Gustave continued east through the Zubrowkian Alps, Towards our high-ranking randez-vous with Serge X Butler. For precaution, we dropped the hidden train to the freighter just outside from the station. </seg>
<seg id="532"> Air de Penache. </seg>
<seg id="533"> Great panorama. I must grant it, for what it is. </seg>
<seg id="534"> I agree. "It is often remarked as a nerve-wise biocoholic -" even in its most extreme and perfect shape ... "- Somebody arrives. </seg>
<seg id="535"> Is she Monsieur Gustave of the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad? </seg>
<seg id="536"> Enter the next cable car. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Is she Monsieur Gustave of the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad? </seg>
<seg id="538"> Change place with me. </seg>
<seg id="539"> Is she Monsieur Gustave of the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad? </seg>
<seg id="540"> Wear these and sing. </seg>
<seg id="541"> - She is Monsieur Gustave of ... - Yes, damn it. </seg>
<seg id="542"> Confess. </seg>
<seg id="543"> I'm innocent. </seg>
<seg id="544"> Eh? No, no. </seg>
<seg id="545"> Forgive me, Monsieur Gustave, I did not want to betray her. </seg>
<seg id="546"> They threatened me with death and now they murdered my only family. No. Who killed this time? </seg>
<seg id="547"> - My lovely sister. - The girl with the wooden leg? </seg>
<seg id="548"> - Yeah. - Damned bastards! </seg>
<seg id="549"> I tried to warn you at the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="550"> I know, my friend. Let's all go. </seg>
<seg id="551"> Listen, I hate making it difficult, but I just have to ask her to rehabilitate me. </seg>
<seg id="552"> - Obviously it's mourning, but ... - There's more. - In this story. - I understand, go ahead. </seg>
<seg id="553"> I have been an official witness, in the presence of Madame D of the drafting of a second testament to be taken into account only in case of violent death. </seg>
<seg id="554"> - A second will? - That's right. - If it was done out. - That's right. </seg>
<seg id="555"> - IS...? - But they destroyed it. </seg>
<seg id="556"> - Oh no. - However... </seg>
<seg id="557"> - Yup...? - I printed a copy. A second copy of the second will? </seg>
<seg id="558"> - That's right. - IS...? </seg>
<seg id="559"> What does he say? Where? What the hell are we talking about? </seg>
<seg id="560"> Do not hold us on the thorns. This is a fucking nightmare. </seg>
<seg id="561"> Tell us what the fuck is going on! </seg>
<seg id="562"> Serge? Serge? Serge! </seg>
<seg id="563"> Hell devils. They strangled him, poor man. </seg>
<seg id="564"> Soon! Come on! </seg>
<seg id="565"> - What do we do if we take it? - I have no idea. </seg>
<seg id="566"> He's a psychopathic assassin. Let's stop. </seg>
<seg id="567"> I can not. I can barely steer. </seg>
<seg id="568"> Pathetic, viscous worm. I hate you. </seg>
<seg id="569"> '' Well, if this is done, it must be my end, either! ' The piercer was wandering, "while the archibugs were thundering and the beers roared for pleasure. "As the bastions ruined." "I think I have swallowed my last lazy," he said ... " </seg>
<seg id="570"> My goodness! You fucked her! </seg>
<seg id="571"> Well done, Zero! </seg>
<seg id="572"> Gustave H! She escaped and escaped justice! </seg>
<seg id="573"> You deliver and I will personally guarantee that it will be handled fairly. </seg>
<seg id="574"> Do not try to escape yet! </seg>
<seg id="575"> - What do you think? - I do not know. </seg>
<seg id="576"> I would lend myself in the strait seat sitting rather than going to jail. </seg>
<seg id="577"> Proposal: We steer the bike to the maniac, recuperate Agatha, we resume Boy with Apple and away on the Maltese Riviera. </seg>
<seg id="578"> Perfect! You're extraordinary, Zero. Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="579"> A moment of silence for a devoted servant brutally killed during the exercise of his duties. Hi, Serge. </seg>
<seg id="580"> OK let's go. </seg>
<seg id="581"> The war started at midnight. </seg>
<seg id="582"> Pfeifelstadt fell to lunch time, under bombing, and 10 battalions overthrew the western border. The supreme command came to Nebelsbad. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Herr Mendl's tribute to the executive staff. </seg>
<seg id="584"> General Stieglitz wants a room overlooking the garden and closet. </seg>
<seg id="585"> Put it in Suite Duca Leopoldo. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Secretary Woroniecki's office was wired. </seg>
<seg id="587"> It arrives one day earlier than expected. Rooms 401, 402 and 403. </seg>
<seg id="588"> Tell the tactical department that we move them to a double on the third floor. </seg>
<seg id="589"> They will need more space for them. </seg>
<seg id="590"> The beginning of the end of the end of the beginning begins. A "Gran Finale" gram-toned on a forgotten piano in a saloon on the edge of a forgotten ghost town. </seg>
<seg id="591"> I will not bear witness to this blasphemy. </seg>
<seg id="592"> Neither do I. </seg>
<seg id="593"> The Grand Budapest became a military camp. </seg>
<seg id="594"> I will never cross my door throughout my life. </seg>
<seg id="595"> - Neither do I. - Never again will I pied ... </seg>
<seg id="596"> Actually, I think we might be coming in now, after all. </seg>
<seg id="597"> Dmitri. </seg>
<seg id="598"> Agatha. </seg>
<seg id="599"> Good evening, Mr. Desgoffe und Taxis. I'm Monsieur Chuck. </seg>
<seg id="600"> We arranged her and her sisters in the King Ferdinand Suite. </seg>
<seg id="601"> Good evening. General von Shrecker asked me to ... </seg>
<seg id="602"> - Who is that? - How do you excuse me? </seg>
<seg id="603"> I think that girl has the picture. Excuse me. </seg>
<seg id="604"> - Sixth. - Wait. </seg>
<seg id="605"> Sixth. </seg>
<seg id="606"> Gifts by Herr Mendl. </seg>
<seg id="607"> I apologize. </seg>
<seg id="608"> Have you seen a bun with a pack under his arm in the last minute and a half? </seg>
<seg id="609"> Yes. He has just entered the elevator with Mr. Desgoffe und Taxis. </seg>
<seg id="610"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="611"> I'm sorry. Who are you? </seg>
<seg id="612"> - Eight, sir, the new Lobby Boy. </seg>
<seg id="613"> - You have not been well trained. </seg>
<seg id="614"> A Lobby Boy never gives such information. </seg>
<seg id="615"> You're a stone wall. Clear? </seg>
<seg id="616"> Nice picture. </seg>
<seg id="617"> Sixth floor. </seg>
<seg id="618"> Where is Boy with Apple? </seg>
<seg id="619"> I'm not your affair! </seg>
<seg id="620"> I'll blow your ass off your ass once and for all. </seg>
<seg id="621"> Put the gun down! </seg>
<seg id="622"> Cease-fire! Cease-fire! </seg>
<seg id="623"> Stop it! </seg>
<seg id="624"> Who is shooting who? </seg>
<seg id="625"> That's Gustave H! Fugitive assassin and art thief. </seg>
<seg id="626"> I trapped it! </seg>
<seg id="627"> That's Dmitri Desgoffe und Taxis! </seg>
<seg id="628"> Responsible for the murders of Vice Kovacs, Serge X and her sister-in-law, and her own mother! </seg>
<seg id="629"> Nobody moves. You are all in stopping. </seg>
<seg id="630"> Who's out at the window? </seg>
<seg id="631"> Agatha! </seg>
<seg id="633"> Hold on! Arrival! </seg>
<seg id="634"> There is something behind the ... </seg>
<seg id="635"> Agatha! </seg>
<seg id="636"> Agatha! </seg>
<seg id="637"> - Are you OK? - I think so. </seg>
<seg id="638"> There is something behind the picture. </seg>
<seg id="639"> He had left everything to Monsieur Gustave, of course. </seg>
<seg id="640"> The magician, named after Schloss Lutz, the factories that produced weapons, medicines and fabrics, an important trade union newspaper, and perhaps the establishment, the Grand Budapest Hotel, has already arrived. </seg>
<seg id="641"> He named me his successor, and for the duration of the war I served my dormant dormitory behind the desk still in the room next to him. </seg>
<seg id="642"> It was just like her friends: insecure, vanity, superficial, blond, needing attention. In the end it was also rich. </seg>
<seg id="643"> But he did not succeed in becoming deceased. </seg>
<seg id="644"> Dear friends, we are here together ... </seg>
<seg id="645"> Neither did my dear Agatha. </seg>
<seg id="646"> You and our baby would be killed two years later by Prussian influence. A disease from nowhere. </seg>
<seg id="647"> Today we care about it in a week, but at that time millions of victims died. </seg>
<seg id="648"> On the morning of the 21st day of employment, Zubrowka's independent state officially ceased to exist. We moved to Lutz with Monsieur Gustave. </seg>
<seg id="649"> Anyway, to answer your first question, of course. </seg>
<seg id="650"> Zero asked me about my humble origins in the hotel industry. I've been, for a period considered, the best Lobby Boy I've ever worked at Grand Budapest. </seg>
<seg id="651"> I think I can say that. </seg>
<seg id="652"> This one has finally overtaken me. </seg>
<seg id="653"> Although, I must say, he had an outstanding master. </seg>
<seg id="654"> Very true. </seg>
<seg id="655"> "Where do these two light-hearted flames," joined for a moment, "in the melting of the stratosphere of our star-shaped twigs, proceed? </seg>
<seg id="656"> "One from the east, the other from west." </seg>
<seg id="657"> Very well. </seg>
<seg id="658"> Do not try it with her. </seg>
<seg id="659"> Why are we still standing on a barley field? </seg>
<seg id="660"> I find these black uniforms rather slimy. </seg>
<seg id="661"> Well, hello, people. We talked just about you. </seg>
<seg id="662"> - Documents. - With pleasure, as always. </seg>
<seg id="663"> You are the first member of death squads to which I am officially presented. </seg>
<seg id="664"> How do you go? </seg>
<seg id="665"> Plus what change, am I saying good? [The French saying: the more you change the more you stay the same] It is a residence permit with the status of third-party employee, my dear, </seg>
<seg id="666"> Read this. </seg>
<seg id="667"> - Bait. - Stay there. </seg>
<seg id="668"> I'll give you my word, if he touches this man with a finger, I'll see her dismissed with disgrace, bound to the fence and hanged before sunset. </seg>
<seg id="669"> There are still dull glories of civilization in this wild slaughterhouse we call humanity. Damned, Dirty, Disgusting Fascist beasts! </seg>
<seg id="670"> He was one of those. </seg>
<seg id="671"> What can I say more? </seg>
<seg id="672"> How's it over? </seg>
<seg id="673"> It's over when they shot him. </seg>
<seg id="674"> So everything went to me. </seg>
<seg id="675"> After dinner, we went to pick up the keys to our rooms, but Monsieur Jean was not in place. I guess he forgot about us. </seg>
<seg id="676"> Obviously, in recent years, properties such as the Grand Budapest have become, with very few exceptions, public goods. </seg>
<seg id="677"> Although the exact terms of the contract with the new government have never been made public, the outcome is obvious to all: Zero Moustafa has poured a huge fortune in exchange for a costly, unprofitable, decadent hotel. </seg>
<seg id="678"> Because? </seg>
<seg id="679"> A mere matter of sentimentality? </seg>
<seg id="680"> It was not from me, it was not at all, but I felt I had to know, For my health, I believe. </seg>
<seg id="681"> Forgive me if I asked her. I hope I have not offended her. </seg>
<seg id="682"> Of course not. </seg>
<seg id="683"> Is that the last link with that vanished world? His world, if he wants to? </seg>
<seg id="684"> His world? </seg>
<seg id="685"> No I do not think so. </seg>
<seg id="686"> See, we already shared a vocation. It would not have been necessary. </seg>
<seg id="687"> No, I kept the hotel for Agatha. </seg>
<seg id="688"> We were happy here. </seg>
<seg id="689"> For a while'. </seg>
<seg id="690"> To be honest, I think his world has vanished long before he came in. </seg>
<seg id="691"> But, I must say, has certainly extended the illusion with infinite grace. </seg>
<seg id="692"> - Salt? - No, I'll sit here for a while. </seg>
<seg id="693"> Goodnight, then. </seg>
<seg id="694"> The following week, I went to take care of South America and started a long wandering abroad. </seg>
<seg id="695"> I did not return to Europe for many years. </seg>
<seg id="696"> It was a lovely old ruin. </seg>
