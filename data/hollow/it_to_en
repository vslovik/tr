1
Need help! Is there anyone?

2
Ichabod Crane, are you?

3
No one else, and I'm not alone.

4
I found something that was recently a man.

5
Burn him! Yes, sir.

6
But we do not yet know the cause of death.

7
In the river the cause of death is drowning.

8
It's possible if there's water in the lungs, but with the pathology you can know if he died before finishing in the river.

9
- I'll have to examine the corpse. - Cut it. Are we pagans?

10
What happened to him? -Back for tow.

11
Well done.

12
The millennium is now at its doorstep.

13
In a few months we will live in the nineteenth century. But courts still use medieval torture tools.

14
- Sit down! - I stand it for good sense and justice. Prisons overflow with convictions for worthless confessions, such as this.

15
Agent Crane!

16
We've heard you this song more than once.

17
Two streets are open before me.

18
The first: let you refresh your ideas in a cell, until you understand the respect for the dignity of my office.

19
Forgive me, but how do I ever realize that we have to use the brain for essential clues to solve the crimes and resort to modern scientific techniques?

20
Which leads me to the second street: there is an indoor village, two days trip north, in the Hudson Islands.

21
It's a place called Sleepy Hollow.

22
Have they talked to you? - That's right.

23
It is a community of farmers, mostly Dutch.

24
Three people were killed in two weeks.

25
They found her with her head cut off from her torso.

26
Get out of my bust? Yeah, like the stem of a flower.

27
You will carry your modern experiments at Sleepy Hollow and you will have to get to the killer.

28
Bring it here, in front of our honest justice.

29
Will you do this? I'll do it.

30
Remembers, you are now, Ichabod Crane, to be put to the test.

31
Pickety witch. The Witch!

32
Who will bribe Pickety witch?

33
Pickety witch. Who will bribe Pickety witch?

34
- Is Theodore? - Forgive me, I'm a stranger.

35
Then, a kiss in advance.

36
I'm looking for Baltus Van Tassel.

37
I'm his daughter, Katrina Van Tassel.

38
We did not hear your name. I did not say that. Sorry.

39
You are a rude! The voice is not raised here.

40
It is to raise the spirit in these dark times, which I and my wife are giving this petticoat.

41
Young man, you're welcome even if you sell something.

42
Thank you sir. I'm Agent Ichabod Crane, sent from New York to investigate the murders at Sleepy Hollow.

43
Then Sleepy Hollow is grateful to you, Agent.

44
And I hope you will stay in this house.

45
Well said, dear. Come on, we'll set you up. Music!

46
Sorry, ma'am.

47
Thank you. Tell Mr. Van Tassel that I'll be down in a moment.

48
Right away, sir.

49
Thanks to God you are here.

50
Excellent, get in! Leave us, my dear.

51
They joined us: Dr. Lancaster, Reverend Steenwyck, Magistrate Samuel Philipse, and finally James Hardenbrook, the notary.

52
- And you, sir?

53
- A simple farmer who has been successful.

54
The city addresses me as a friend and adviser.

55
And possessor and banker. We proceed?

56
Thank you.

57
Then three people were assassinated.

58
First, Peter Van Garrett and his son Dirk Van Garrett. They were both strong and capable men. Found together, decapitated.

59
A week later, the Winship widow. She is also decapitated.

60
Now you will need to ask a lot of questions.

61
But before, tell me: is someone suspected?

62
What did your superiors explain to you?

63
That the three were killed in the full campaign.

64
The heads are separated from their bodies.

65
No, they were not found at all.

66
Have the heads gone?

67
They were taken by the headless knight and brought to hell.

68
Forgive me, I do not ... It's better that you sit down.

69
SÃƒÂ¬.

70
The knight was a Hessian mercenary, sent here by a German princess To hold the Americans under the yoke of England.

71
Unlike his compatriots who came for money, the rider came for the sake of carnage.

72
When you joined the battle, you found him there.

73
A giant black genius rode: Temerario.

74
He spun the horse in battle, thrusting the galloping heads.

75
Her teeth had been covered up to make them sharp, to make her appearance more fierce.

76
This butcher found its end in the winter of '79 in our forests to the west.

77
His head swung with his sword.

78
Even today, that place is infested by spirits and nobody ventures.

79
Because that day was planted the seed of evil.

80
And so it has been for twenty years.

81
But now he is awakened and in the fury of revenge he will cut the heads where he will find them.

82
Is this what you believe?

83
See is to believe.

84
You have brought equipment and books for scientific investigations.

85
This is the only book I recommend you read.

86
I see.

87
By telling Steenwyck, gentlemen, homicide does not need ghosts from the tomb.

88
We have murder in New York without goblins and spells.

89
You are away from New York.

90
The assassin is a man in flesh and bones, and I'll find it.

91
Come out, devil.

92
It's called Powder Powder. It should be fine ...

93
Thank you. - Good luck if you need calls.

94
Thank you.

95
Do not worry about anything. You will see that everything will be resolved.

96
Thomas, at home!

97
Go for breakfast. She also kisses mom for me.

98
The knight has killed again!

99
Up, Shot Powder, you leave. Power!

100
On the other side!

101
Good horse!

102
Mr Miller, come back with the coffin wagon. Yes, sir.

103
- Keep your eyes open.

104
Reassure me, there I am now.

105
The fourth victim, Jonathan Masbath.

106
I see.

107
And your head?

108
Jack. Jack.

109
- Very interesting. - What?

110
It usually removes the head to prevent identification.

111
But we know it's Jonathan Masbath.

112
Exactly. So why is the head removed?

113
PerchÃƒÂ ©? Exact.

114
Did you move the corpse? SÃƒÂ¬.

115
You never have to! PerchÃƒÂ ©?

116
Why not!

117
The swing is gigantic!

118
The aggressor overwhelmed Masbath, shot the horse, and went back to claim his head.

119
Yeah, there's a chemical reaction.

120
Show that there was a single, powerful shot at the neck.

121
Power. Interesting. - What?

122
The wound is instantly cauterized as if the blade was bled but there are no bruises. The devil's fire!

123
Beware, it is written in the first letter of St. Peter, paragraphs 5 to 8, because your opponent, the devil, runs like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour.

124
God welcomes Jonathan Masbath.

125
Mr agent! Ah, are you the young Masbath?

126
I was the young Masbath. Now I am the only one.

127
At your service. Morally forced to avenge my father.

128
Only and unique Masbath, thank you. But you will be more useful to your mother.

129
My mother is in heaven.

130
Now my dad cares for her, you have no one. I'm your man! - You have great courage. But I can not care about you.

131
I'm sorry for your loss.

132
- Agent Crane. Mr. Philipse.

133
You must know.

134
Jonathan Masbath was not the fourth victim, but the fifth. - The fifth? Yeah, five victims in four graves.

135
Young Masbath! Found a place in Van Tassel's lodgings.

136
Wake up before dawn. I hope you have a strong stomach.

137
Peter Van Garrett, Dirk Van Garrett,

138
Jonathan Masbath.

139
Five victims, four tombs.

140
The widow Winship.

141
Bring it inside the widow!

142
- It's an irregular thing. Yes, but necessary.

143
We have to work immediately.

144
Work? She's dead.

145
I mean they'll need the operating table.

146
Here, too, the wound on the neck is cauterized.

147
The sword of the stomach, as well.

148
But to what purpose?

149
What is your purpose?

150
What tools are these? I am of my own creation.

151
Go out, young Masbath.

152
Thank you, Mr. Killian. If you do not mind, Doctor, I can not concentrate when I'm observed.

153
What are they going to do? What will happen to your head? What did you do to her?

154
This is a mentally ill person.

155
What did you find out?

156
The Winship widow was pregnant.

157
Who is lÃƒÂ?

158
Forgive the intrusion. No intrusion.

159
I come here to read when they are sleepless.

160
Read books to hide? They were my mother. My father feels that the novels were love to kill her.

161
He's dead, two years in the winter.

162
The nurse who cares for her now is Lady Van Tassel.

163
There is another thing. Why did not anyone tell me that the Van Garrett are Van Tassel's relatives?

164
All families in Sleepy Hollow are related to blood or marriage.

165
I see.

166
This land gave the Van Garrett to my father. They were the richest family.

167
When we came here, Van Garrett systemed us into a land acre with a dilapidated cottage. My father works hard. She made a fortune and built this house. I need him my happiness.

168
I remember when we were poor in the lodge.

169
Do you want me to show you? SÃƒÂ¬.

170
Bring it on, it's my gift to you.

171
I do not need it. Are you so sure of everything?

172
It was your mother. Keep it close to your heart, it's a protection against evil.

173
Are you so sure of everything?

174
Strange these signs. What are? I always remember them.

175
As a child I played beside this fireplace.

176
My first drawing school. My mother was my teacher.

177
You see, sculpted on the chimney wall? The archer. I forgot about it.

178
It was long before we came here.

179
Do you feel good? Yeah, thank you.

180
A red cardinal! My favorite.

181
I want to tame one, but I do not feel like fooling it.

182
So, I got one thing for you.

183
Red cardinal, an empty cage.

184
And now...

185
Do you know how to make spells? Teach me!

186
It's not magic. That's what we call optical illusion. Separate images join in rotation.

187
It's the truth, but the truth is not always what appears.

188
What are you fleeing from, Philipse? Damn!

189
-Did you help me? Yeah, and now I live in terror ... of powers from which there is no defense.

190
How did you know Winship widow was pregnant?

191
- She told you. - I want you to be your father. - I'm not the father. Did you reveal the name?

192
SÃƒÂ¬. He came to me for a board of magistrates to protect the rights of his son.

193
I should have kept the secret but ...

194
Do you think he killed the man? - The knight killed her.

195
How many times do I have to tell you, there is no knight.

196
- What's that? - My talisman. - It protects me from the knight.

197
You, a magistrate, with the head full of these nonsense! Tell me the name ...

198
My God!

199
Agent Crane!

200
Did not go out for nothing?

201
- He was a headless knight! - Do not worry.

202
- He was a headless knight! You are here for this.

203
You have to believe me! Headless!

204
I know. - No! You were not there!

205
- It's all true! - We all said it.

206
I saw it!

207
I guess he'll be back in town.

208
Okay, this time, I'll go to New York in person.

209
I do not let an amateur detective run.

210
This time the dead man is a magistrate!

211
I need men capable of going to the woods to the west.

212
We thought you would not have more cartridges!

213
I have won my fears, I want to locate the knight's tomb.

214
In short, I'm against a murderous ghost.

215
Who is with me?

216
I.

217
Van Garrett, widow Winship, your father Jonathan Masbath, and now Philipse. There must be a link.

218
Did your dad have business with Van Garrett?

219
He worked for them, we lived in the shelter. There is nothing else.

220
But one night, one week before the murder, there was a quarrel upstairs between father and son.

221
Then Mr. Van Garrett called my dad.

222
A quarrel between father and son ...

223
Then Van Garrett calls the servant, Masbath.

224
Listen.

225
- I do not feel anything. Not even me.

226
No birds. No cricket. It's all quiet.

227
Accelerate your pace.

228
Forgive the intrusion but maybe you can help us. - Come on that mortuary? Yeah, in a way.

229
Precisely I do not hypothesize about your occupation.

230
Nothing about witch ways ... they're awesome. Yeah, awesome ways.

231
It's the same, whatever you are. To each his own. Do you know the knight?

232
That of Hessia? That one, madame! You come with me. Get out of here, baby.

233
Stay away, whatever you feel.

234
What could you feel like having to get away? He goes to Hollow and returns. I feel! I know the blood on him. - Really?

235
I'm here to find it And let it stop. I can give you the knowledge of the underworld.

236
-What do you do? Do not move, do not talk!

237
When the other one arrives, I'll handle it.

238
- The other? Is coming!

239
Can you hear me?

240
Are you looking for a knight without blood head?

241
Follow the Indian path until the sun dies until the dead tree. Sit down where your knight rests.

242
Let's go. Quickly!

243
Take the Indian path up to the Dead Tree.

244
-What do we recognize it? Without difficulty, I'm afraid.

245
Then get down to the place where he rests.

246
His camp? - His tomb.

247
Stay here.

248
Not a gesture, turn around! I got a gun!

249
Katrina, I could kill you! Why are you here?

250
Because no one wanted to follow you.

251
Now they are twice as strong. It's your white magic.

252
The dead tree.

253
Blood.

254
Stay where you are.

255
-What is this? Stay there, do not move!

256
This tree is a passage between two worlds.

257
The ground has been ruined. The ground is broken.

258
Take the shovel!

259
The skull has disappeared.

260
That's why the knight returns from the tomb.

261
He takes tests as long as his will not come to him.

262
Ichabod!

263
Let's split. Glenn, Theodore.

264
Do not tease your teeth, you will teach Thomas bad habits.

265
I'm a bad habit. Oh really? - That's good, and a nanna. SÃƒÂ¬.

266
Escape!

267
You are good.

268
- It's not you who you want! - I fix it!

269
We can not defeat him!

270
Such a wound would have to kill him.

271
But no points are needed and there is almost no blood loss.

272
You have to be quiet, you have the fever.

273
Katrina!

274
Nostradamus mediamus. Milk of Mercy.

275
I tried to stop Brom ...

276
Drink, you will sleep.

277
The knight did not want to kill Brom nÃ © me.

278
If Brom did not attack her! After that, rest!

279
I discovered that the rider did not casually knock.

280
His victims are chosen by someone who controls him.

281
The same person who took his skull.

282
Someone in the flesh and bones he knew where to dig.

283
As I have always said. They're boiling! Drink.

284
You were dreaming. SÃƒÂ¬.

285
Things I forgot about.

286
- And I do not want to remember more. - Tell me what you dreamed of.

287
My mother was an innocent. A daughter of nature.

288
Condemned, murdered ... by my father.

289
Murdered? To save her soul from a wicked fanatic with the mask of righteousness.

290
I was seven years old when I lost faith.

291
What do you think then? - In the criterion and in the reason.

292
Cause and consequence. I should not have come to this place. My rational mind has been rebuffed by the spirit world. Do not you find anything here so it's worth it to come?

293
No, no, no.

294
A kiss from a beautiful young man before he saw my face and knew my name.

295
Without criterion or reason.

296
Forgive me, I talk about kisses ...

297
You lost your Brom. - I poured tears for Brom, but I do not have the broken heart. - Do you find it unsuitable? - No.

298
Maybe there's a little witch in you. Why do you know this? Because you got me astonished.

299
- You slept like a dead man. Too good, I do not deserve it.

300
Served by the hostess. - Oh, you would not. But our servlet is gone. Sarah? Run like so many others. They go for fear.

301
- Where's Katrina? He watched you until dawn. Now it's up to her to sleep.

302
I'm ready for another day.

303
Enough to face a deadly adversary.

304
Dr. Lancaster, Reverend Steenwyck, Notary Hardenbrook, and Magistrate Philipse who tried to give us a cut and received it in which Philipse was killed.

305
Here is a conspiracy.

306
The doctor and the reverend, the notary and the magistrate.

307
What is the secret that keeps them united?

308
Philipse knew that the widow was pregnant, and did not want to tell me the father's name.

309
What does this mean?

310
We have to go for elimination.

311
They'll make a list of the people of Sleepy Hollow. Beginning with his first citizen, Baltus Van Tassel.

312
- I feel we are very close. SÃƒÂ¬. I guess Baltus is the first citizen now that Garrett is dead. SÃƒÂ¬, and Van Garrett. I almost forgot them!

313
- Come with me! Where? - By the notary Hardenbrook. Do you have an idea? Yeah, an idea!

314
Hopeless.

315
My dad's folder. Why is this here?

316
Leave me alone! Notary Hardenbrook!

317
As soon as you have shown Van Garrett's will. Leave everything to his son. - He died with him. Therefore inheritance goes to the closest relative.

318
Naturally. All legal and without cheating. -Sir! I'm a dead man!

319
Van Garrett's seal, broke.

320
He seems to have written a new one, shortly before dying, naming heir ... the widow Winship.

321
And here, look, a marriage certificate.

322
Van Garrett had secretly married the widow.

323
Leaving everything to her and to the unborn baby.

324
The new will lies between the fortunes of Van Garrett and the person who would have inherited everything. We four have been involved against our will.

325
You four? It means...

326
Of course. the four old citizens.

327
Now I understand the roles you had.

328
The Reverend Steenwyck knew the secret because he had married them, Dr. Lancaster was in charge of the pregnant woman Philipse's magistrate provided the protection of the law, and the notary Hardenbrook occult the documents that had been given by Van Garrett to his faithful servant.

329
The four conspirators involved in the plot.

330
We did not know it was a death plot!

331
I have not finished!

332
First, the Van Garrett was killed by a rider born from the grave, then a widow invokes the estate.

333
And away his head. But homicide is the cause of homicide.

334
Servant, Jonathan Masbath.

335
When father and son fluttered for the new testament,

336
Jonathan Masbath was called to be a witness.

337
Here is his signature. It was his death sentence.

338
The knight has the system.

339
The system was ordered by someone who had power over him.

340
Someone had dug in the woods to the west and stole the skull.

341
The missing head that must be returned to the knight.

342
Someone who could get or lose a fortune.

343
Van Garrett's closest relative: Baltus Van Tassel!

344
-Why are you here? - Because it's your room.

345
- Was it unsuitable? - No.

346
You missed me, where have you been? From the notary.

347
- I had to talk to Hardenbrook. Did you know anything?

348
It can be.

349
- My father ... your dad? Yeah, my dad thinks you should go back to New York. Really? And Why Why?

350
Maybe he looked at your log and did not like what he saw.

351
What have you got? Tests.

352
Now, sorry, I have to ask you ... - I leave you to your reflections.

353
It's just a spider. Kill him! No, hit it!

354
- It's something below. Thing?

355
Let's move the bed. I can not, do it.

356
The evil eye! Someone is making an invoice.

357
The evil eye!

358
Wait here.

359
You burned the evidence. - So you will not blame my dad.

360
Do not accuse anyone, but if there is any fault I can not alter the thing. Not even an invoice can alter it.

361
Your father takes advantage of these murders.

362
If I knew you would not have this opinion.

363
Or try something for me. - They are held back by reasoning.

364
What the friends conspire ... You're the agent, not me.

365
Find other reasonings and let me stay.

366
I can not do it, neither the one nor the other thing. And my heart is affrighted. I do not think you have a heart. I was thinking of giving you mine.

367
SÃƒÂ¬. You loved me to follow me in the woods and to face that danger.

368
There was no danger to me if my father controlled the knight.

369
Goodbye. Malay the day you came to Sleepy Hollow!

370
- Katrina will not see you. Did not say anything?

371
Only that will not come down.

372
I understand, thank you. - Agent!

373
You have not asked me yet how badly I was in my hand, it would have been very kind.

374
You have been careful not to look at it and not talk about it.

375
I regret. How did you ... - I know you've seen me! Thing? - You followed me last night.

376
You promise not to tell my husband. Promise!

377
The city is in a hurry. Hardenbrook is dead!

378
That old-fashioned old man? - He's hanged tonight. Hanged?

379
Steenwyck called for a church assembly for tonight.

380
Every woman, man or child will pronounce against you!

381
If you are wise, leave this place!

382
Cos'ÃƒÂ¨? I was flabbergasted with the kitchen knife.

383
- The wound looks serious. - Later the fascia with wild maranas. I know where they grow.

384
Hurry up! The bell of the assembly rattles!

385
- The Knight! Katrina! Father!

386
Save me!

387
He killed your stepmother! God!

388
Fire!

389
You will kill us all! It is you who wants it!

390
Can not come in!

391
Can not come in! - Why should we die for you?

392
- Can not cross the gate! We have to save ourselves!

393
The next one touched me, will have a bullet!

394
Do not go!

395
There have been dead days. We confess our sins.

396
- What do you know? - They told you the fake.

397
We have been possessed diabolically by ...

398
Get away! Back!

399
Back!

400
Here is a conspiracy! I'll smash it!

401
An evil spirit possessed you.

402
Please God that you are satisfied and that you are in peace.

403
The evil eye did his job. My life is over. Saved for a life of horrors in sleep and awakening aches.

404
Goodbye, Katrina.

405
Believe it was Katrina, did not it? You never have to say it!

406
Strange kind of witch, with a loving and kind heart.

407
- How can you think that? - I have a good reason.

408
You are scared of reason. - I'm down to reason.

409
It's a tough lesson for a tough world. Learn it well.

410
Infamy has many masks. The most dangerous is the virtue.

411
Goodbye.

412
Get the carriage, go back!

413
Forgive me!

414
No blood nor coagulation nor scratching. When the cut was done this woman was dead.

415
Adorable child, you have the air of seeing a ghost.

416
Again, my dark genius.

417
Another night of decapitation. Get up with your sword!

418
One head for a head.

419
My sacrilegious knight, come on!

420
Come on now for ... Katrina!

421
Finally wake up! Did you think it was a bad dream?

422
Dad saw the knight kill you!

423
He saw the rider coming toward me with his sword pulled. But I'm the governor of the knight.

424
And Baltus did not look at it.

425
But there was a corpse! Serve, Sarah.

426
I've always found it useless.

427
But a utility has demonstrated it.

428
Who are you? The name of my family ... was Archer. The archer!

429
I lived with my father, my mother and sister not far from here. As long as my father died. And the landlord we had always served faithfully, we'll bust.

430
No one wanted to welcome us because my mother was suspected of witchcraft.

431
But she instruct her daughters at art, while we were living in the woods to the west.

432
MorÃƒÂ¬ within a year.

433
My sister and I stayed in our shelter.

434
Without seeing a soul, until one day ... gathering wood, we met the Hessian mercenary.

435
I saw his death.

436
At that moment I offered my soul to Satan, if he had risen the knight to avenge me.

437
Revenge? Yeah, of Van Garrett.

438
He had no pity and hunger for us, while Baltus Van Tassel with his wife and daughter was rubbing us home.

439
I swear I would become the mistress of everything she had.

440
It was easy. I came into your house as your nurse's nurse, put my body in a coffin and mine in my double bed.

441
It was not so easy to secure my legacy.

442
The widow had to disappear, of course

443
and also the servant Masbath. Then days later, midwife Killian told me that the widow had revealed a secret to her.

444
She told me right in front of her husband, what a goof!

445
Another work for the knight.

446
Lust has led the Reverend Steenwyck in my power.

447
Fear did the same with Hardenbrook and Philipse.

448
And the doctor's silence I got in exchange for my complicity, in her fornication with Sarah servant.

449
Yeah, you got it all right now. - No.

450
You have everything, dear, to your father's will. I'll have it all with your death.

451
By the way, my sister suddenly died.

452
Rather recently.

453
Did you kill your sister? - She wanted it herself. Helping you and your master.

454
Just in time To make you cut your head.

455
The rider arrives and tonight is for you!

456
Thank God!

457
Beware of the head!

458
On the roof! I have an idea.

459
Jump on the blades!

460
Jump!

461
Soon!

462
Is dead? The problem was that he was dead.

463
- Where do we go? Get out of here!

464
Get the reins!

465
Ichabod!

466
The bag!

467
Jump!

468
- Still alive? Scappa, Katrina!

469
Yeah, go, jump and jump!

470
Take it, it's yours!

471
You're not dead!

472
Knight!

473
Just in time for the new century!

474
You will soon be going, young Masbath.

475
The Bronx is up, Battery down and home is here.
