1
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
HEAD-ON

2
00:01:17,082 --> 00:01:23,646  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Along the stream I wander

3
00:01:24,022 --> 00:01:29,619  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Watching for the fish in the troubled water

4
00:01:31,029 --> 00:01:33,896  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But I am troubled over you

5
00:01:34,233 --> 00:01:37,327  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My beloved Saniye With your wind-blown hair

6
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:42,500  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I am saddened by your gaze that does not requite my love

7
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,511  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But I am troubled over you

8
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,145  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My beloved Saniye with your wind-blown hair

9
00:01:51,483 --> 00:01:56,250  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I am saddened by your gaze that does not requite my love.

10
00:02:31,623 --> 00:02:34,114  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Cahit, you okay? - Want a drink, Seref?

11
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,922  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yeah, a coke.

12
00:02:39,164 --> 00:02:41,257  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Gimme another beer, babe.

13
00:02:43,368 --> 00:02:45,563  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're really thirsty today, huh?

14
00:02:50,442 --> 00:02:51,966  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's right, bro'.

15
00:02:53,378 --> 00:02:55,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Then drinkwater.

16
00:02:55,914 --> 00:02:58,849  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm not a dog!

17
00:03:35,954 --> 00:03:37,683  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How was the concert?

18
00:03:44,529 --> 00:03:45,894  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Piss off, Maren.

19
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:48,225  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Asshole!

20
00:03:50,235 --> 00:03:52,100  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Fuck you! - Motherfucker!

21
00:03:57,376 --> 00:03:58,468  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, you!

22
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:04,009  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, you bum! I'm talking to you!

23
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:06,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Such a cute chick

24
00:04:06,585 --> 00:04:08,450  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and you tell her to shove it?

25
00:04:09,721 --> 00:04:11,689  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You a faggot or something?

26
00:04:13,558 --> 00:04:15,423  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You must be a faggot...

27
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What the fuck are you doing?

28
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:36,706  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get outta here, Cahit! Go home!

29
00:04:37,215 --> 00:04:40,412  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Stop this shit! Go home now!

30
00:04:40,786 --> 00:04:42,583  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Go home now!

31
00:05:59,064 --> 00:06:01,259  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My old lady brought me here.

32
00:06:06,138 --> 00:06:07,969  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What does that make me?

33
00:06:12,878 --> 00:06:16,041  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But I got people, I'm telling you. I'll fucking show her.

34
00:06:16,414 --> 00:06:19,645  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What kinda people? - Guys who work security.

35
00:06:20,552 --> 00:06:24,181  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll show her, I tell you. She won't get away with it.

36
00:06:24,923 --> 00:06:26,891  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But Schiller's basically okay.

37
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,057  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I saw him the last time. - You were ward in 13, too...

38
00:06:32,597 --> 00:06:34,326  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Cahit Tomruk, please.

39
00:06:54,252 --> 00:06:59,451  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There are a thousand otherways to kill yourself.
Why drive into a wall?

40
00:07:02,561 --> 00:07:05,621  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who says I wanted to kill myself?

41
00:07:06,131 --> 00:07:07,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There were no skid marks.

42
00:07:15,173 --> 00:07:17,767  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You can't smoke here, Mr. Tomruk.

43
00:07:24,549 --> 00:07:28,485  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where does the name Tomruk come from? - From Turkey.

44
00:07:29,221 --> 00:07:30,654  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What does it mean?

45
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:35,151  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No idea. - Their names have beautiful meanings.

46
00:07:35,527 --> 00:07:36,687  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Oh, yeah?

47
00:07:37,062 --> 00:07:41,089  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Much more than ours. At least the first names do.

48
00:07:46,538 --> 00:07:51,168  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
If you want to end your life, end it.
But you don't have to die to do that.

49
00:07:53,612 --> 00:07:56,206  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
End your life here and go somewhere else.

50
00:07:57,382 --> 00:07:59,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do something useful.

51
00:07:59,818 --> 00:08:01,410  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do something.

52
00:08:01,953 --> 00:08:04,012  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Go to Africa. Help people.

53
00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:12,087  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do you know the band ''The The?''

54
00:08:13,331 --> 00:08:14,499  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sorry?

55
00:08:14,499 --> 00:08:20,267  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
One of their songs goes,''If you can't change the world,

56
00:08:20,438 --> 00:08:27,901  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
change your world''. You want the record?- l've got it.

57
00:08:29,147 --> 00:08:31,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Should I tell you something, Doc?

58
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:34,852  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're off your rocker, you know that?

59
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:46,195  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Are you Turkish? Would you marry me?

60
00:08:47,499 --> 00:08:50,161  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What? - Would you marry me?

61
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,001  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Fuck off!

62
00:08:57,442 --> 00:09:00,309  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Nice to meet you, Cahit Tomruk.

63
00:09:02,314 --> 00:09:03,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Cahit Tomruk...

64
00:09:04,215 --> 00:09:05,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sibel Tomruk...

65
00:09:15,226 --> 00:09:17,786  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Excuse me, can I help you?

66
00:09:19,664 --> 00:09:21,063  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A cold beer, please.

67
00:09:21,566 --> 00:09:25,593  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We don't have any beer here, but you can have a coffee.

68
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The shame you have brought upon us is unforgivable.

69
00:09:33,845 --> 00:09:37,178  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mankind's greatest gift is life.

70
00:09:37,716 --> 00:09:41,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There is no greater gift than that.

71
00:09:41,853 --> 00:09:47,382  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who do you think you are to throw this gift away?

72
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,358  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You should be happy that you're still alive.

73
00:10:00,305 --> 00:10:02,364  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do you have the keys, Yilmaz?

74
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:06,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
See you later.

75
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,682  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Can't you see what you're doing to him?

76
00:10:15,186 --> 00:10:16,710  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's killing him.

77
00:10:19,457 --> 00:10:20,856  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Look at me!

78
00:10:21,526 --> 00:10:23,289  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Look at me!

79
00:10:23,962 --> 00:10:26,897  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
If anything happens to the old man, you're dead meat.

80
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,745  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Give me one, too.

81
00:10:51,556 --> 00:10:54,616  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What good would it do to kill yourself?

82
00:10:56,027 --> 00:11:00,657  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You'rejust making us and yourself unhappy.

83
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:04,761  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't forget that. - I thought they'd leave me alone then.

84
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:09,764  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Leave you alone? I never could teach you anything.

85
00:11:10,141 --> 00:11:12,109  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't say that, Mother.

86
00:11:14,813 --> 00:11:16,075  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Oh, Sibel...

87
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:21,613  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How long are they keeping you? - Dunno.

88
00:11:22,053 --> 00:11:24,453  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't let the crazies in here drive you crazy.

89
00:11:32,063 --> 00:11:33,462  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How's it going, Cahit?

90
00:11:38,369 --> 00:11:41,429  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You won't die that way. - What do you mean?

91
00:11:44,109 --> 00:11:45,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You gotta cut along the vein,

92
00:11:45,977 --> 00:11:47,501  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
not across it.

93
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,347  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Across is shit. - Aha.

94
00:11:58,189 --> 00:12:00,020  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You got a beer, babe?

95
00:12:00,391 --> 00:12:02,188  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
If you marry me.

96
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:06,961  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I only fuck men. - Really?

97
00:12:13,505 --> 00:12:15,735  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Y'know what? I'll get you a beer.

98
00:12:16,741 --> 00:12:19,107  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Be outside the clinic at midnight.

99
00:12:46,337 --> 00:12:48,271  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where's my beer? - Come on.

100
00:12:49,841 --> 00:12:53,106  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where do you come from in Turkey? - Mersin.

101
00:12:53,645 --> 00:12:56,773  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mersin is supposed to be nice.
- Yeah, I know. I was born there.

102
00:12:57,315 --> 00:13:00,546  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We come from Zonguldak. Do you know Zonguldak?

103
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,544  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why do you want to die?

104
00:13:09,294 --> 00:13:11,285  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I asked you a question.

105
00:13:16,201 --> 00:13:17,725  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
D'you think my nose is nice?

106
00:13:20,438 --> 00:13:21,735  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Touch it.

107
00:13:31,983 --> 00:13:35,248  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My brother broke it 'cause he caught me holding hands.

108
00:13:37,155 --> 00:13:38,645  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Now touch my tits.

109
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,989  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You ever seen such great tits?

110
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:48,126  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I want to live, Cahit. To live and to dance and to fuck!

111
00:13:48,499 --> 00:13:51,127  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And notjust with one guy. Get it?

112
00:13:52,437 --> 00:13:53,927  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm not deaf!

113
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,932  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You don't understand shit!

114
00:14:00,645 --> 00:14:03,580  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Will you marry me now, Cahit? - Forget it.

115
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:09,383  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No!

116
00:14:11,356 --> 00:14:12,380  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, leave me alone!

117
00:14:14,058 --> 00:14:15,150  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Oh, shit.

118
00:14:15,994 --> 00:14:18,827  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Marriage? Girl, are you out of your head?

119
00:14:19,163 --> 00:14:22,963  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It not some kids' game! - It's just a pretence, get it?

120
00:14:23,301 --> 00:14:24,962  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, I don't get it!

121
00:14:26,104 --> 00:14:29,767  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's just an alibi for my parents.
So I don't have to live at home.

122
00:14:30,108 --> 00:14:33,544  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We'll live together, I promise I'll be a good room-mate.

123
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:37,369  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll buy groceries, I'll cook, tidy, clean the toilet.

124
00:14:37,749 --> 00:14:42,015  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We have separate rooms, we don't fuck, nothing.
- And your parents?

125
00:14:42,387 --> 00:14:45,151  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Your in-laws. You wouldn't have much to do with them.

126
00:14:45,523 --> 00:14:48,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What do I have to do with them?

127
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,094  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Just visit them sometimes.

128
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:56,259  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And then pretend to be man and wife or what?

129
00:14:56,601 --> 00:14:58,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Girl, are you mental?

130
00:14:59,704 --> 00:15:04,641  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And why me? I'm a bum!
- Because they'd accept you. You're Turkish!

131
00:15:15,086 --> 00:15:18,385  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's going on here? - Get off! - What do you mean?

132
00:15:18,756 --> 00:15:21,020  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I said, get off! - Why?

133
00:15:21,526 --> 00:15:23,221  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Because there's no room

134
00:15:23,861 --> 00:15:27,388  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
for godless dogs like you on my bus!

135
00:15:27,732 --> 00:15:29,529  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get out! You, too!

136
00:15:30,034 --> 00:15:32,434  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, man, what's up? - What d'you mean, what's up?

137
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:36,064  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's not your bus. It's the city's. - Fuck off!

138
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,843  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, wait!

139
00:15:44,816 --> 00:15:46,408  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's your name?

140
00:16:04,135 --> 00:16:07,662  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Her window faces the street

141
00:16:11,843 --> 00:16:15,335  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Her admirers throw gravel at the pane

142
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:23,111  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My beloved is the girl with the most beautiful eyebrows

143
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:30,692  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Find yourself a love, too

144
00:16:31,062 --> 00:16:34,691  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And make of her your wife

145
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,753  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Have you totally lost it?

146
00:18:12,296 --> 00:18:14,696  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do you thinkyou're an actor?

147
00:18:15,233 --> 00:18:17,133  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
D'you want an Oscar?

148
00:18:17,502 --> 00:18:21,939  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You don't understand. The girl's up to her neck in trouble.

149
00:18:22,306 --> 00:18:26,470  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What do you care? - She says she'll kill herself

150
00:18:27,778 --> 00:18:31,942  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
if I don't do it. - The fuck she will. And you believe her?

151
00:18:32,483 --> 00:18:34,348  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Women are like that.

152
00:18:34,719 --> 00:18:37,654  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They make up stories to trap you.

153
00:18:38,155 --> 00:18:40,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You knowwhat getting married means? - No, I don't.

154
00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:44,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Problems! Look at me. I never married.

155
00:18:44,896 --> 00:18:47,990  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I don't owe anyone anything. And I have my peace and quiet.

156
00:18:48,332 --> 00:18:50,698  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Liar! You did get married!

157
00:18:51,068 --> 00:18:54,060  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That was different! That was so I could stay here.

158
00:18:54,572 --> 00:18:57,200  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Well, this is the same thing.

159
00:18:58,442 --> 00:19:01,741  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So get married, for fuck's sake! God bless you!

160
00:19:02,246 --> 00:19:05,044  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll come and dance at your wedding.

161
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:17,955  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There was one more thing... - What?

162
00:19:23,868 --> 00:19:26,166  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Birsen? - What?

163
00:19:26,537 --> 00:19:30,940  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do you know this man? - No, but our daughter does.

164
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:33,243  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Our daughter knows him.

165
00:19:33,778 --> 00:19:36,975  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How can you give our daughterto a stranger?

166
00:19:37,915 --> 00:19:42,511  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She's already made so many mistakes.
This could be a change forthe better.

167
00:19:42,887 --> 00:19:46,584  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She's made mistakes because of how you raised her.

168
00:19:47,124 --> 00:19:48,523  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
From childhood on.

169
00:19:49,026 --> 00:19:53,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
When are they coming?
- Tomorrow, whetheryou like it or not.

170
00:19:54,131 --> 00:19:55,462  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So soon?

171
00:19:57,001 --> 00:19:59,561  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Then let them come, damn it!

172
00:20:03,207 --> 00:20:06,301  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're dragging me into the same shit you're in!

173
00:20:06,844 --> 00:20:09,244  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What city are we from again?

174
00:20:10,247 --> 00:20:12,340  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mersin. - Mersin?

175
00:20:13,351 --> 00:20:15,615  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Not Malatya? - No, man. It was Mersin.

176
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,486  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mersin! - Fuckyour Mersin.

177
00:20:19,023 --> 00:20:21,753  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Friends, what's going on?

178
00:20:22,126 --> 00:20:24,526  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
None of your fucking business.

179
00:20:24,895 --> 00:20:28,991  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You don't have to yell at each other!
- Just get on with it, will you?

180
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,628  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll do you in a second. - Do me? What do you mean?

181
00:20:33,004 --> 00:20:35,529  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I didn't mean it that way.

182
00:20:36,073 --> 00:20:37,472  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No problem then.

183
00:20:42,013 --> 00:20:45,642  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Is there alcohol in the chocolates? - No. - Are you sure?

184
00:20:46,017 --> 00:20:48,781  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Are you pulling my leg? - You sure?

185
00:20:49,153 --> 00:20:52,589  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Damn it, there's no alcohol in them!

186
00:20:52,957 --> 00:20:55,926  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Fuck you and your alcohol!
They're more expensive with alcohol.

187
00:20:56,427 --> 00:20:59,294  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You don't need to scream at me. I was only asking.

188
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:03,259  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You've already asked a hundred times!

189
00:21:03,601 --> 00:21:05,398  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Which house number? - Eight.

190
00:21:05,903 --> 00:21:08,167  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's with your hair? - lt's modern.

191
00:21:08,706 --> 00:21:11,675  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This is a marriage proposal and you look like a fag!

192
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:14,807  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They'll never give herto you like that.

193
00:21:15,146 --> 00:21:18,479  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What was the name again? - Guner.

194
00:21:23,854 --> 00:21:26,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So you are...

195
00:21:27,024 --> 00:21:29,754  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Cahit's uncle?

196
00:21:30,227 --> 00:21:34,129  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes, I mean... I'm his youngest uncle.

197
00:21:35,032 --> 00:21:37,865  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How many siblings are you?

198
00:21:38,602 --> 00:21:41,503  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Um... hold on... there are lots...

199
00:21:43,941 --> 00:21:45,909  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Seven. - Yes, seven.

200
00:21:47,311 --> 00:21:51,338  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My respect. - You and your nephew are so similar.

201
00:21:56,687 --> 00:21:59,178  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes, maybe. - Where do your parents live?

202
00:22:00,257 --> 00:22:01,849  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My parents...

203
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
are dead.

204
00:22:07,465 --> 00:22:10,161  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My sympathies. - Thankyou.

205
00:22:12,236 --> 00:22:14,204  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do you have any brothers or sisters?

206
00:22:15,372 --> 00:22:19,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I have a sister in Frankfurt.

207
00:22:19,944 --> 00:22:21,104  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do you see each other?

208
00:22:21,812 --> 00:22:24,975  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Now and then...

209
00:22:25,516 --> 00:22:27,882  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Your Turkish sucks. What did you do with it?

210
00:22:29,587 --> 00:22:30,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Threw it away.

211
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,417  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That was just ajoke.

212
00:22:36,227 --> 00:22:39,663  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There's no alcohol in those, is there?

213
00:22:40,464 --> 00:22:42,329  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, of course not.

214
00:22:49,273 --> 00:22:51,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where are you from in Turkey?

215
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:55,205  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Malatya. - Mersin. Mersin.

216
00:22:55,913 --> 00:23:00,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I mean part of the family is from Mersin
and part is from Malatya.

217
00:23:01,051 --> 00:23:03,611  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They moved from Mersin to Malatya.

218
00:23:04,121 --> 00:23:06,885  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A scattered family! - Yes, exactly.

219
00:23:13,531 --> 00:23:16,466  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thankyou. - I hope you liked it.

220
00:23:22,106 --> 00:23:23,698  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where did you meet my sister?

221
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:26,870  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Well, I work in the hospital.

222
00:23:30,247 --> 00:23:35,776  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Cahit visits me two or three times a week.

223
00:23:36,153 --> 00:23:39,554  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And when he was there, he saw Sibel.

224
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:43,485  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And then we decided to buy chocolates.

225
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:50,867  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And you're the manager of a factory? - Yes...

226
00:23:51,235 --> 00:23:55,137  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, I'm the manager of ''The Factory.''

227
00:23:55,372 --> 00:23:58,205  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's a venue for concerts and culture.

228
00:23:58,709 --> 00:24:01,542  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm the boss there. - I'll visit sometime.

229
00:24:01,912 --> 00:24:02,901  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My pleasure.

230
00:24:04,014 --> 00:24:07,279  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Isn't he a bit old for you?

231
00:24:07,618 --> 00:24:09,176  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I like him.

232
00:24:11,055 --> 00:24:13,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Couldn't you find anyone better?

233
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:27,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thank you for your hospitality. - My pleasure.

234
00:24:27,771 --> 00:24:29,534  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let's get down to our reason for coming.

235
00:24:30,674 --> 00:24:32,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We have come,

236
00:24:33,277 --> 00:24:35,768  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
God be willing,

237
00:24:37,915 --> 00:24:40,577  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
for my nephew Cahit

238
00:24:41,585 --> 00:24:44,645  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
to ask for the hand of your daughter Sibel.

239
00:24:50,394 --> 00:24:51,326  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sibel!

240
00:24:54,932 --> 00:24:55,864  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes, Father?

241
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Is your mind made up?

242
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,500  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes, Father.

243
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:18,487  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What can one do? When two young people have come together,

244
00:25:20,357 --> 00:25:24,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and are in love with one another,
what is left for us to say?

245
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
God bless you both.

246
00:25:31,135 --> 00:25:32,102  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thank you.

247
00:25:32,703 --> 00:25:35,672  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Cahit, kiss your father's hand.

248
00:25:41,578 --> 00:25:42,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thankyou.

249
00:26:01,498 --> 00:26:03,329  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm coming, damn it!

250
00:26:05,502 --> 00:26:08,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Are you fucking crazy? - Hi, Cahit!

251
00:26:22,353 --> 00:26:24,253  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
D'you have any coffee here?

252
00:26:24,855 --> 00:26:26,720  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The coffee maker is fucked.

253
00:26:29,593 --> 00:26:32,528  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A Turkish wedding is fucking expensive.

254
00:26:32,896 --> 00:26:35,160  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who's gonna pay for it? - I've got the dough.

255
00:26:35,499 --> 00:26:40,027  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where from?
- lI always thought I'd run away some day, so I saved up.

256
00:26:40,404 --> 00:26:42,463  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And why the fuck didn't you do it?

257
00:26:43,774 --> 00:26:46,174  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
For my mother's sake. - Ah, yes.

258
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:51,304  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Is your sister coming, too? - No.

259
00:26:51,648 --> 00:26:53,843  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why not? - None of your damn business.

260
00:26:56,487 --> 00:26:59,456  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who'll be your witness? Your brother?

261
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:03,949  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My cousin Selma from lstanbul. She's great...
- I don't give a shit.

262
00:27:04,294 --> 00:27:06,785  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She'll bring a horde of Turks, l bet.

263
00:27:07,164 --> 00:27:09,132  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, she's coming alone. She's divorced.

264
00:27:09,733 --> 00:27:12,725  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We can do that, too. Then l'll be outta your hair.
- Good idea.

265
00:27:21,211 --> 00:27:25,307  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Here! - What the fuck is that?
- I guessed on the size. Hope it fits.

266
00:27:29,053 --> 00:27:30,111  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Good guess.

267
00:27:42,566 --> 00:27:46,093  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sibel! l've missed you! - Howwas yourflight?

268
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,301  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They searched me again.

269
00:27:48,672 --> 00:27:51,197  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where's my brother-in-law? - He's busy.

270
00:27:51,542 --> 00:27:55,740  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let me look at you. Your butt's gotten nice and round.

271
00:27:57,014 --> 00:27:59,983  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How did you meet? - lt's a long story.

272
00:28:00,484 --> 00:28:03,885  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tell me! - Where do I start? - At the beginning.

273
00:28:25,075 --> 00:28:26,975  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Selma. - Cahit.

274
00:28:30,514 --> 00:28:32,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Take care of her.

275
00:28:38,922 --> 00:28:41,891  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thanks. - What do I do? Kiss you? - Later.

276
00:28:42,226 --> 00:28:43,284  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What? - Later.

277

279
00:28:54,338 --> 00:28:56,363  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Is that correct? - Yes.

282
00:29:06,884 --> 00:29:09,785  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes, it is. - You may proceed to the ceremony.

283
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How did your wife die?

284
00:29:12,256 --> 00:29:14,884  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Cahit! - Shut up, do you understand?

285
00:29:15,425 --> 00:29:17,484  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's up? - I didn't understand.

286
00:29:17,828 --> 00:29:22,094  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't you speak German? - Sure. Ein Bier, bitte!

291
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,488  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But we have to! - No way, no how. Alright?

292
00:29:54,198 --> 00:29:57,190  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Please, Cahit. I beg you. - Cahit...

293
00:29:57,701 --> 00:30:00,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
... everybody's looking.

294
00:30:05,709 --> 00:30:09,145  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You lying cunt. - Yeah, that's me.

295
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,882  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's this? - This is your room.

296
00:30:51,788 --> 00:30:54,450  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This is where you eat. - Alright.

297

298
00:31:16,013 --> 00:31:17,537  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You want some, too?

299
00:31:18,882 --> 00:31:19,814  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes.

300
00:32:02,059 --> 00:32:03,959  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Won't you carry me across the threshold?

301
00:32:05,629 --> 00:32:06,823  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Whoops!

302
00:32:13,003 --> 00:32:14,493  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's for later.

303
00:32:22,913 --> 00:32:25,848  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Can I ask you something? - Sure.

304
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,810  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What was your wife's name?

305
00:32:34,324 --> 00:32:35,882  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What the hell?

306
00:32:38,995 --> 00:32:39,859  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Out!

307
00:32:41,732 --> 00:32:43,324  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Piss off, God damn it!

308
00:32:50,674 --> 00:32:51,572  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Katharina.

309
00:33:01,385 --> 00:33:04,684  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'd like another one. - I wanted to close up, actually.

310
00:33:05,989 --> 00:33:07,286  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Already?

311
00:33:07,824 --> 00:33:10,224  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Gotta happen sometime.

312
00:33:35,051 --> 00:33:37,349  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You know where I could sleep tonight?

313
00:33:37,921 --> 00:33:39,411  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How about with the groom?

314
00:33:39,756 --> 00:33:43,283  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He threw me out. - Great! Offto a good start...

315
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:57,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Well, if you want...

316
00:33:58,975 --> 00:34:00,704  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
there's my place.

317
00:34:04,314 --> 00:34:05,406  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
If you want.

318
00:34:07,484 --> 00:34:09,611  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You know you're stealing a bride?

319
00:35:28,298 --> 00:35:32,667  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You had so many alternatives. You didn't have to marry.

320
00:35:33,703 --> 00:35:35,170  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What alternatives?

321
00:35:36,373 --> 00:35:39,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You could have gone to university in another city.

322
00:35:39,776 --> 00:35:43,405  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Like I finished high school...
- You could've married someone else.

323
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,441  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Not such a bum.

324
00:35:45,949 --> 00:35:49,544  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm too young to marry seriously.
Should I become a housewife?

325
00:35:51,454 --> 00:35:52,944  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come to me.

326
00:35:54,391 --> 00:35:56,120  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
In lstanbul.

327
00:36:18,915 --> 00:36:21,611  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's like a chick-bomb exploded in here!

328
00:36:21,985 --> 00:36:23,009  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Unbelievable!

329
00:36:23,553 --> 00:36:25,578  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll cut your dick off in a second...

330
00:36:26,556 --> 00:36:28,615  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What did all this shit cost?

331
00:36:29,793 --> 00:36:31,624  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Enough to make me broke.

332
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:36,994  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And who'll pay the rent? - I don't know.

333
00:36:37,467 --> 00:36:39,935  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm not paying your share, just so that's clear.

334
00:36:45,108 --> 00:36:47,702  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Can't you hold still?

335
00:36:52,182 --> 00:36:53,479  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's enough now...

336
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:56,080  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You can't make a prince out of a peasant.

337
00:37:09,966 --> 00:37:10,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There.

338
00:37:11,167 --> 00:37:12,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Done.

339
00:37:15,805 --> 00:37:16,863  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Go shower.

340
00:37:34,057 --> 00:37:35,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do you need help, Maren?

341
00:37:51,074 --> 00:37:52,974  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You in a good or a bad mood?

342
00:37:55,078 --> 00:37:56,443  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So so.

343
00:38:04,788 --> 00:38:06,050  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thanks.

344
00:38:06,389 --> 00:38:07,321  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're welcome.

345
00:39:00,243 --> 00:39:01,938  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who cut your hair?

346
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,211  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My room-mate.

347
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,980  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Since when do you have a room-mate?

348
00:39:13,723 --> 00:39:15,190  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Since the clinic.

349
00:39:15,558 --> 00:39:17,423  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do you fuck? - No.

350
00:39:17,794 --> 00:39:20,160  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do you? - No.

351
00:39:22,966 --> 00:39:24,331  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Is she nice?

352
00:39:29,706 --> 00:39:31,469  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She could use ajob.

353
00:39:47,223 --> 00:39:49,054  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hi, I'm Sibel.

00:39:51,461 --> 00:39:54,589  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're Cahit's room-mate, right? - Yes.

355
00:39:55,999 --> 00:39:59,298  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You need ajob? - Yes, I cut hair really well.

356
00:40:00,436 --> 00:40:01,528  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Well then...

357
00:40:01,905 --> 00:40:05,705  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hello. I have an appointment at eleven. - Then have a seat.

00:40:07,777 --> 00:40:09,506  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Want to? - Yes.

359
00:40:12,248 --> 00:40:15,740  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do you mind if she does it? - Sure, no problem.

360
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:18,144  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thanks. How do you want it?

361
00:40:18,655 --> 00:40:21,180  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Just trim the ends, please. - Alright.

362
00:40:21,691 --> 00:40:25,627  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Should l wash it foryou?
- No, I just did it. It's still damp.

363
00:40:52,555 --> 00:40:55,490  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It looks fucking great! - Yeah, babe, yeah!

364
00:40:55,992 --> 00:40:59,120  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Next, I'm gonna get a tattoo! This big!

365
00:40:59,495 --> 00:41:00,427  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yeah!

366
00:41:03,633 --> 00:41:05,726  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Maren is really cool! - Yeah!

367
00:41:06,069 --> 00:41:09,368  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She's got a great ass! - Yeah, I think so, too!

368
00:41:09,739 --> 00:41:12,264  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She's got a great ass!

369
00:41:19,148 --> 00:41:20,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Does my piercing look good? - Yeah!

370
00:41:21,417 --> 00:41:23,817  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's great! Really fucking great!

371
00:41:24,187 --> 00:41:27,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I want to show it off. Let's go dancing.
- Naw. Don't want to.

372
00:41:28,057 --> 00:41:29,854  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Please. Let's go out.

373
00:41:30,193 --> 00:41:33,856  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I want to showyou off, too.
- If I can choose the place. Okay?

374
00:41:34,397 --> 00:41:35,728  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Okay! - Yeah!

375
00:41:36,099 --> 00:41:39,762  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Punk is not dead!

376
00:42:47,937 --> 00:42:49,700  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Cahit, I'm gonna get laid!

377
00:42:51,374 --> 00:42:53,171  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Did you see the guy?

378
00:46:07,136 --> 00:46:10,105  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How many heads did you wash to pay for this thing?

379
00:46:10,473 --> 00:46:13,271  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yilmaz got it cheaperthrough his connections
at the workshop.

380
00:46:14,877 --> 00:46:17,175  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do I really have to come?

381
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,843  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We've been married 6 months and haven't been there yet!

382
00:46:21,384 --> 00:46:24,987  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I hate all this Turkish crap! - Oh, please, Cahit!

383
00:46:24,987 --> 00:46:25,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Fuck your ''Oh, please!''

384
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:30,520  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Your Turkish is really improving!

385
00:46:35,164 --> 00:46:37,394  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Whose turn is it? Come on!

386
00:46:38,034 --> 00:46:40,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Play one or draw one, man!

387
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:44,697  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How could you give your little sister to this guy?

388
00:46:45,041 --> 00:46:48,844  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't interfere in our family affairs. - Hey, guys!

389
00:46:48,844 --> 00:46:52,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I was in ''Pascha'' last week.
There were lots of new chicks there.

390
00:46:53,049 --> 00:46:55,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Scandinavian, African...

391
00:46:55,685 --> 00:46:58,415  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Any Turkish ones? - I got enough of them at home.

392
00:47:00,756 --> 00:47:02,747  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Play! Your turn, man.

393
00:47:03,125 --> 00:47:05,787  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, brother-in-law, you should come with us some time.

394
00:47:07,496 --> 00:47:08,690  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where to?

395
00:47:09,031 --> 00:47:10,055  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The brothel.

396
00:47:11,601 --> 00:47:14,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What would l want there? - What a question!

397
00:47:16,105 --> 00:47:17,970  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's Michael Jackson's brother called?

398
00:47:19,508 --> 00:47:22,170  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Siki Ceksin! (l'm gonna fuck!) - Good one!

399
00:47:25,348 --> 00:47:28,112  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why don't you fuck your own wives?

400
00:47:36,492 --> 00:47:37,891  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What did you say?

401
00:47:40,997 --> 00:47:45,434  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why don't you fuck your own wives? It's your turn.

402
00:47:49,205 --> 00:47:53,972  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't ever use the word ''fuck'' in connection with our wives!

403
00:47:54,176 --> 00:47:56,440  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You understand me? - What?

404
00:47:56,812 --> 00:48:00,407  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do you understand me? - Calm down.

405
00:48:01,517 --> 00:48:05,044  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My chairfell over. - Galatasaray will win.

406
00:48:05,421 --> 00:48:09,824  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They're gonna lose, you know?
- Four top players gone. No way.

407
00:48:19,669 --> 00:48:23,002  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What did you say before? I'll fucking smack your face in!

408
00:48:23,539 --> 00:48:25,302  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll smash your face in! - Sit down!

409
00:48:29,945 --> 00:48:30,934  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So...

410
00:48:31,314 --> 00:48:32,941  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
how is your husband?

411
00:48:33,582 --> 00:48:34,879  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Very loving.

412
00:48:35,318 --> 00:48:36,649  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And in bed?

413
00:48:38,354 --> 00:48:39,321  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Fine.

414
00:48:40,056 --> 00:48:41,683  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Does he lick?

415
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:45,891  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Like a cat.

416
00:48:46,395 --> 00:48:49,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're lucky! Mine licks like an ox,

417
00:48:49,565 --> 00:48:52,125  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and moos like one while he's doing it!

418
00:49:00,376 --> 00:49:02,936  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, hold on a second.

419
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:11,451  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're not the manager, you just...

420
00:49:13,155 --> 00:49:14,452  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
collect empties.

421
00:49:15,191 --> 00:49:17,091  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why did you lie to us?

422
00:49:19,428 --> 00:49:22,022  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Put yourself in my shoes.

423
00:49:22,998 --> 00:49:24,966  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You pick up empty glasses for a living.

424
00:49:27,837 --> 00:49:30,101  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Would you have given your sisterto me?

425
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:35,709  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You love her?

426
00:49:38,748 --> 00:49:39,680  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes.

427
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:42,647  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I love her.

428
00:49:53,629 --> 00:49:54,527  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thanks.

429
00:49:57,933 --> 00:50:00,197  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I was looking at him... Can I get another beer?

430
00:50:00,569 --> 00:50:04,373  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Make it two! A buddy of mine's there and he says,

431
00:50:04,373 --> 00:50:05,374  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
''Don't look at me like that!''l say
''What's up with your eyebrows?''

432
00:50:05,374 --> 00:50:06,375  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They were all burned.''What's with you, man?'' I say. He says,

433
00:50:06,375 --> 00:50:07,342  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
''I'm lovesick.'' And I said,''But that doesn't explain it...''

434
00:50:19,588 --> 00:50:22,455  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You want another drink? - No, I'm all right.

435
00:50:29,432 --> 00:50:32,333  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I can give you a couple of things to listen to.

436
00:50:32,835 --> 00:50:35,030  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yeah? - Yeah. - l'd like that.

437
00:50:35,404 --> 00:50:39,033  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I got a couple of demos at home. - Yeah? - So if you want...

438
00:50:39,575 --> 00:50:43,511  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You live around here? - Around the corner. - Aha.

439
00:50:53,556 --> 00:50:54,454  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey!

440
00:50:55,257 --> 00:50:56,189  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hello?

441
00:50:57,259 --> 00:50:58,191  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey!

442
00:51:26,088 --> 00:51:29,182  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I don't believe it! Another double!

443
00:51:29,692 --> 00:51:31,387  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're feeling good, aren't you?

444
00:51:33,963 --> 00:51:35,863  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What makes you think so?

445
00:51:36,365 --> 00:51:38,094  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You fuck better.

446
00:53:15,264 --> 00:53:17,494  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Marrying you wasn't such a bad idea.

447
00:53:19,134 --> 00:53:21,034  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I learned it from my mother.

448
00:53:30,379 --> 00:53:33,815  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Speaking of which... my mother asked about children today.

449
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:43,490  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let's make some.

450
00:53:46,261 --> 00:53:49,526  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
If she keeps prying, I'll tell her you're impotent.

451
00:53:50,766 --> 00:53:52,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's a good reason for a divorce, too.

452
00:53:56,639 --> 00:54:02,669  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You want to go to ''Taksim'' tonight?

453
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:42,682  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hello.

454
00:54:45,854 --> 00:54:47,719  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A spritzer, please.

455
00:54:59,435 --> 00:55:00,959  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's that?

456
00:55:04,773 --> 00:55:05,705  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thanks.

457
00:55:15,684 --> 00:55:18,778  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Have you seen her? - Who?

458
00:55:19,154 --> 00:55:20,314  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My wife.

459
00:55:22,825 --> 00:55:25,555  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She's your wife? - So what?

460
00:55:28,897 --> 00:55:30,125  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What are you staring at?

461
00:55:30,766 --> 00:55:32,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I thought you two didn't fuck.

462
00:55:34,536 --> 00:55:36,128  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We don't fuck.

463
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:44,435  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why not if you're man and wife?

464
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:13,968  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where you going? - I want to go in.

465
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:18,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sorry, no unaccompanied men.
- It's funny, but my wife's inside.

466
00:56:19,414 --> 00:56:22,212  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's funny, but I don't give a shit! - Yeah? - Right.

467
00:56:22,551 --> 00:56:25,987  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Fuck you, man! - Hey, stay cool, man. - What?

468
00:56:26,321 --> 00:56:28,619  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Stop! That's my husband!

469
00:56:29,158 --> 00:56:31,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Okay, he's your husband. But you calm down.

470
00:56:32,094 --> 00:56:34,187  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Cool it. Nice and easy, okay?

471
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:37,255  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No trouble in there, okay? - Yes.

472
00:56:38,267 --> 00:56:40,394  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Alright. It's okay, boys.

473
00:56:40,769 --> 00:56:41,701  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Peace!

474
00:56:50,412 --> 00:56:51,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sibel!

475
00:56:57,052 --> 00:57:00,852  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm sorry I ran off before. I apologize.

476
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:03,853  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's okay.

477
00:57:04,226 --> 00:57:06,091  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm just a mental case, y'know?

478
00:57:07,062 --> 00:57:08,529  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Aren't we all?

479
00:57:41,663 --> 00:57:45,793  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, babe, what's up? - What d'you want?
- You. Can't you tell?

480
00:57:46,168 --> 00:57:48,329  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Piss off! - Stay cool, girl.

481
00:57:48,837 --> 00:57:51,897  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, that's mywife. - What? - Cahit!

482
00:57:52,441 --> 00:57:54,602  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Cahit? What's going on?

483
00:58:13,795 --> 00:58:16,093  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Your face isn't too bad.

484
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,768  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I do what I can to keep my good looks.

485
00:58:35,384 --> 00:58:36,681  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Fucking Turks.

486
00:58:37,786 --> 00:58:39,981  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What? You're one ofthem.

487
00:58:53,268 --> 00:58:55,168  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I know so little about you.

488
00:59:07,950 --> 00:59:09,850  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Then get to know me.

489
01:00:45,814 --> 01:00:47,179  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Stop!

490
01:00:47,516 --> 01:00:49,950  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Stop! Stop! Stop it!

491
01:00:51,553 --> 01:00:54,420  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I can't! I can't!

492
01:00:55,724 --> 01:00:59,251  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
If we do it, then I'm your wife and you're my husband.

493
01:01:00,862 --> 01:01:01,920  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Understand?

494
01:01:10,138 --> 01:01:11,696  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm in love!

495
01:01:14,309 --> 01:01:15,241  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
In love!

496
01:01:16,111 --> 01:01:17,510  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She's bewitched me!

497
01:01:18,013 --> 01:01:19,378  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Stop it, boy!

498
01:01:19,915 --> 01:01:21,644  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Stop it! You've cut yourself!

499
01:01:21,883 --> 01:01:26,752  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Fuck your ''In love,''Take a look at yourself!

500
01:01:26,922 --> 01:01:28,890  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do you even know what love is?

501
01:01:29,891 --> 01:01:31,654  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Love is a merry-go-round.

502
01:01:31,993 --> 01:01:34,518  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Put your money in and it starts to spin.

503
01:01:34,896 --> 01:01:39,162  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But it only goes in circles,
and the horse you're on is made of wood.

504
01:01:40,936 --> 01:01:43,404  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You don't understand me!

505
01:01:43,905 --> 01:01:45,736  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You don't understand anything!

506
01:02:43,899 --> 01:02:45,696  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She was called Katharina.

507
01:02:46,234 --> 01:02:48,099  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She was such a happy person.

508
01:02:50,038 --> 01:02:51,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Like a child. Really funny.

509
01:02:53,575 --> 01:02:55,065  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She laughed a lot.

510
01:02:57,045 --> 01:02:58,706  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Everyone liked her.

511
01:03:00,715 --> 01:03:02,842  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I really liked her a lot.

512
01:03:04,486 --> 01:03:06,852  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What did she do? - She was a painter.

513
01:03:09,291 --> 01:03:10,588  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Did Cahit love her?

514
01:03:16,531 --> 01:03:17,828  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Very much.

515
01:03:22,737 --> 01:03:24,864  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's going on between you two, anyway?

516
01:03:28,343 --> 01:03:30,470  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He's my husband, I'm his wife.

517
01:03:33,248 --> 01:03:35,079  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do you love each other?

518
01:03:35,817 --> 01:03:37,580  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You wouldn't understand.

519
01:03:40,055 --> 01:03:41,989  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yeah, I'm probably too stupid.

520
01:03:44,826 --> 01:03:47,056  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I don't understand it myself.

521
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,332  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Cahit and I fuck sometimes.

522
01:04:06,848 --> 01:04:08,645  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sibel! - Shit!

523
01:04:11,052 --> 01:04:12,815  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey! - What are you doing here?

524
01:04:15,123 --> 01:04:16,852  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I wanted to see you. - Why?

525
01:04:18,226 --> 01:04:22,128  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Niko, listen. We screwed.
I wanted to know howyou were in bed.

526
01:04:22,597 --> 01:04:25,896  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Now l know.
You steer clear of me and I'll steer clear of you.

527
01:04:26,234 --> 01:04:28,759  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What? - Leave me alone. I'm a married Turkish woman.

528
01:04:29,104 --> 01:04:32,403  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Try anything and my husband will kill you!

529
01:04:51,526 --> 01:04:53,391  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who's she married to?

530
01:05:51,419 --> 01:05:53,683  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What kind of fucked up husband are you?

531
01:05:57,759 --> 01:06:01,092  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Your wife whores around all over and you don't give a shit.

532
01:06:04,099 --> 01:06:05,930  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do you even fuck her?

533
01:06:08,036 --> 01:06:09,663  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Oh, I get it!

534
01:06:10,038 --> 01:06:11,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're her pimp, right?

535
01:06:12,974 --> 01:06:15,943  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Fuck you! - Niko, you talk too much.

536
01:06:16,978 --> 01:06:18,843  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Does her cunt bring in good money?

537
01:06:22,717 --> 01:06:24,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tell me...

538
01:06:25,687 --> 01:06:28,554  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What does it cost if I want to fuck her in the ass?

539
01:06:32,093 --> 01:06:33,856  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Is 50 Euros enough?

540
01:06:39,834 --> 01:06:42,200  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I want to fuck your Turk the Greekway!

541
01:06:48,243 --> 01:06:49,175  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Niko!

542
01:06:50,879 --> 01:06:51,811  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Niko!

543
01:06:55,984 --> 01:06:57,576  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Call a doctor!

544
01:08:50,198 --> 01:08:52,962  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
JEALOUSY KILLING IN ST. PAULI

545
01:10:26,327 --> 01:10:28,921  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Listen, you can't stay here.

546
01:10:29,297 --> 01:10:31,891  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You have to leave in the morning so nobody sees you.

547
01:10:32,233 --> 01:10:34,133  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Or I'll get thrown out of here.

548
01:10:38,339 --> 01:10:40,239  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do you understand?

549
01:10:41,676 --> 01:10:42,608  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes.

550
01:10:44,545 --> 01:10:47,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't you have anyone to go to? Answer me!

551
01:10:48,416 --> 01:10:49,610  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No.

552
01:10:52,353 --> 01:10:54,378  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
God in Heaven!

553
01:10:57,692 --> 01:10:59,592  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And what are you going to do now?

554
01:11:03,297 --> 01:11:05,527  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They'll kill me. - Who?

555
01:11:07,168 --> 01:11:08,226  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My family.

556
01:11:10,938 --> 01:11:12,306  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Your family!

557
01:11:12,306 --> 01:11:18,142  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What do you expect?
You fuck everything up and then cry, ''My family!''...

558
01:11:18,446 --> 01:11:20,846  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't you have anyone in Turkey?

559
01:11:22,583 --> 01:11:24,551  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes. - Then go there.

560
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:26,814  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What about Cahit?

561
01:11:27,321 --> 01:11:29,755  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What do you care about Cahit?

562
01:11:30,291 --> 01:11:32,759  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Can't you see what you've done to him?

563
01:11:33,294 --> 01:11:35,129  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You've ruined his life!

564
01:11:35,129 --> 01:11:36,096  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
''What about Cahit?''...

565
01:11:45,173 --> 01:11:46,731  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Listen up.

566
01:11:49,010 --> 01:11:51,376  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do you really love Cahit?

567
01:11:54,449 --> 01:11:55,381  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes.

568
01:11:56,484 --> 01:11:59,112  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Then do him a favor.

569
01:12:00,321 --> 01:12:01,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Leave!

570
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:27,208  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My raven-haired beauty

571
01:12:27,749 --> 01:12:30,081  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why do you cry?

572
01:12:31,119 --> 01:12:42,087  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Everything that comes to pass Will pass again one day

573
01:12:42,463 --> 01:12:44,260  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Cry not...

574
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:51,029  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Even if your lament Reaches up to Heaven above

575
01:12:51,372 --> 01:12:55,604  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Everything that comes to pass Will pass again one day

576
01:12:55,943 --> 01:12:57,672  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Cry not...

577
01:13:13,494 --> 01:13:15,394  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Whatever comes to pass

578
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:19,525  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Winterwill be followed by Spring.

579
01:13:20,668 --> 01:13:23,364  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Everything that comes to pass

580
01:13:25,606 --> 01:13:39,452  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Will also go again one day Cry not...

581
01:13:42,256 --> 01:13:45,623  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No exchanging any objects, no looking at any papers,

582
01:13:45,993 --> 01:13:48,655  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and do not discuss the trial.

583
01:13:48,996 --> 01:13:51,260  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Please close the door behind you.

584
01:14:33,007 --> 01:14:34,804  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll wait for you.

585
01:16:08,803 --> 01:16:10,703  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Fasten your seat belt, Sibel.

586
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:17,675  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Your hair looks good.

587
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:21,475  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You hungry?

588
01:16:22,216 --> 01:16:23,148  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No.

589
01:16:28,422 --> 01:16:30,754  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What are you plans?

590
01:16:31,959 --> 01:16:33,688  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Can you get me ajob?

591
01:16:34,228 --> 01:16:35,661  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
As a hair dresser?

592
01:16:38,299 --> 01:16:39,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't care.

593
01:16:41,769 --> 01:16:43,464  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We'll see...

594
01:16:43,804 --> 01:16:45,032  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come on, smile!

595
01:17:02,023 --> 01:17:04,651  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How's it going? - Good.

596
01:17:07,561 --> 01:17:11,520  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sibel, don't worry. It'sjust for a little while.

597
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,431  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The hairdresser's supposed to call.

598
01:17:14,935 --> 01:17:18,336  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
As soon as something comes up, he'll hire you.

599
01:17:21,842 --> 01:17:22,774  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hello.

600
01:17:24,478 --> 01:17:26,969  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Take care... I'm on my way.

601
01:17:31,085 --> 01:17:32,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do you like the hotel?

602
01:17:36,557 --> 01:17:37,489  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sibel!

603
01:17:38,325 --> 01:17:40,225  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Should I tell you something?

604
01:17:41,162 --> 01:17:45,189  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll be responsible for everything you see here one day.

605
01:17:45,733 --> 01:17:48,793  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll be manager in a couple of years.

606
01:17:50,504 --> 01:17:53,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Then you can work where you want! How do you like that?

607
01:17:57,144 --> 01:17:59,612  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You only have to believe in yourself.

608
01:18:06,554 --> 01:18:08,419  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Can I have a Raki?

609
01:18:20,101 --> 01:18:21,568  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do you miss Cahit?

610
01:18:50,898 --> 01:18:52,024  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come on, Sibel!

611
01:19:22,096 --> 01:19:23,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
STAFF ENTRANCE

612
01:19:58,332 --> 01:20:02,098  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So I go to the meeting and get in the elevator.

613
01:20:02,469 --> 01:20:07,168  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It was, like, an old building with elevators from the 80's.

614
01:20:08,676 --> 01:20:12,544  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You get all the way to the top and
you can't get the door open.

615
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:15,371  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And there's this wall...

616
01:20:30,598 --> 01:20:32,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're not from around here, are you?

617
01:20:35,035 --> 01:20:38,334  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How can you tell? - I just can.

618
01:20:41,775 --> 01:20:43,367  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Listen guys...

619
01:20:46,146 --> 01:20:48,011  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where can I get some drugs?

620
01:20:49,783 --> 01:20:51,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Are you out ofyour mind?

621
01:21:13,307 --> 01:21:15,207  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where've you been? - Out.

622
01:21:15,709 --> 01:21:18,041  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where? - None of your business.

623
01:21:18,545 --> 01:21:19,534  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sibel!

624
01:21:32,026 --> 01:21:33,323  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My beloved husband,

625
01:21:33,661 --> 01:21:35,925  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I've been here a couple ofweeks now.

626
01:21:36,297 --> 01:21:38,993  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Istanbul is a colorful city, full of life.

627
01:21:39,366 --> 01:21:41,129  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm the only one not really living here.

628
01:21:41,969 --> 01:21:43,994  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All I do is survive.

629
01:21:44,505 --> 01:21:46,735  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'd like to discover it all with you.

630
01:21:47,641 --> 01:21:50,667  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But God is putting us to the test. God?

631
01:21:51,178 --> 01:21:55,012  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I don't know what I'm supposed
to believe in after all of this.

632
01:21:55,349 --> 01:21:58,807  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You pulled the short straw, but jail is the onlything.

633
01:21:59,186 --> 01:22:02,121  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I can compare my life to here.

634
01:22:02,456 --> 01:22:06,222  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I clean rooms at the Marmara Hotel. Selma got me the job.

635
01:22:07,061 --> 01:22:09,586  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Selma, whom I used to admire so much.

636
01:22:09,963 --> 01:22:12,830  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Now I can only despise her.

637
01:22:13,334 --> 01:22:16,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I hope you are doing well. I kiss you, Sibel.

638
01:22:47,568 --> 01:22:49,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Looking for someone?

639
01:22:51,305 --> 01:22:52,670  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm looking to score.

640
01:22:58,746 --> 01:22:59,940  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Score what?

641
01:23:01,615 --> 01:23:02,843  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Anything.

642
01:23:28,609 --> 01:23:30,304  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's that?

643
01:23:30,677 --> 01:23:31,609  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Opium.

644
01:23:35,816 --> 01:23:37,249  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Wanna try?

645
01:23:40,187 --> 01:23:41,484  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Give it here.

646
01:23:45,392 --> 01:23:46,324  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Draw.

647
01:23:47,628 --> 01:23:48,560  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Draw.

648
01:24:03,010 --> 01:24:04,910  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come and workfor me.

649
01:24:08,549 --> 01:24:11,382  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You can move in here, too, if you want.

650
01:24:22,095 --> 01:24:24,290  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where to? - I'm moving.

651
01:24:24,798 --> 01:24:28,825  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where are you going? - I made some friends.

652
01:24:29,203 --> 01:24:32,798  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What kind of friends? - Friends...

653
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:34,572  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sibel!

654
01:24:35,409 --> 01:24:36,467  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't go!

655
01:24:36,844 --> 01:24:39,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So I can be like you? Work, sleep, work!

656
01:24:40,347 --> 01:24:43,908  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's why your husband divorced you!

657
01:26:08,635 --> 01:26:09,533  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sibel.

658
01:26:12,839 --> 01:26:13,771  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sibel!

659
01:26:16,743 --> 01:26:17,675  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes.

660
01:26:19,479 --> 01:26:20,377  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get out!

661
01:26:43,370 --> 01:26:44,962  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, baby!

662
01:26:45,305 --> 01:26:48,138  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What are you doing out so late?

663
01:26:48,475 --> 01:26:50,136  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Have you lost your way?

664
01:26:50,677 --> 01:26:52,736  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You need a man?

665
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:55,105  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Wait up!

666
01:26:57,517 --> 01:26:59,985  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why don't you go fuckyour mothers?

667
01:27:01,421 --> 01:27:02,820  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Stop laughing!

668
01:27:09,296 --> 01:27:10,786  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Fucking slut!

669
01:27:19,039 --> 01:27:21,269  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's enough! That's enough!

670
01:27:34,988 --> 01:27:36,182  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You sons-of-bitches!

671
01:27:36,690 --> 01:27:38,590  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Is the best you can do?

672
01:27:38,925 --> 01:27:42,759  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Watch your mouth, girl! - I'm gonna fuck her up now.

673
01:27:45,666 --> 01:27:47,759  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who're you gonna fuck up?

674
01:27:49,436 --> 01:27:52,303  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Is that enough now? Have you had enough now?

675
01:28:17,998 --> 01:28:22,094  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Fuck you and your families! - What the fuck did you say?

676
01:28:23,437 --> 01:28:24,734  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You faggots!

677
01:28:26,973 --> 01:28:28,463  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sons-of-bitches!

678
01:28:29,443 --> 01:28:30,671  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come back!

679
01:28:38,385 --> 01:28:39,784  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Holy shit!

680
01:28:41,988 --> 01:28:44,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I think we've killed her!

681
01:28:45,258 --> 01:28:46,691  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Shit! God damn it!

682
01:28:47,427 --> 01:28:49,691  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Is that what you wanted? ls it?

683
01:28:50,063 --> 01:28:51,655  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Is it?

684
01:28:51,998 --> 01:28:53,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Run, brothers!

685
01:28:54,735 --> 01:28:55,861  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get out of here!

686
01:28:57,604 --> 01:28:58,764  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get out of here!

687
01:30:18,685 --> 01:30:20,050  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do you like it?

688
01:30:20,420 --> 01:30:23,685  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's good. Very good. - lsn't it?

689
01:30:24,024 --> 01:30:27,482  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They have good kebabs here. That's why I always come here.

690
01:30:28,762 --> 01:30:29,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Cheers!

691
01:30:31,398 --> 01:30:32,888  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

692
01:30:44,010 --> 01:30:45,910  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What are you planning on doing?

693
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:48,347  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm going to lstanbul.

694
01:30:50,350 --> 01:30:51,647  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
To Sibel?

695
01:30:53,019 --> 01:30:53,951  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes.

696
01:30:56,957 --> 01:30:58,720  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Didn't you learn anything?

697
01:30:59,726 --> 01:31:02,559  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Didn't Sibel do you enough harm?

698
01:31:03,997 --> 01:31:05,965  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Without her

699
01:31:06,967 --> 01:31:09,868  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'd never have made it.

700
01:31:10,237 --> 01:31:12,102  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Made what?

701
01:31:15,742 --> 01:31:17,710  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'd never have made it through.

702
01:31:29,122 --> 01:31:30,054  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Alright.

703
01:31:34,094 --> 01:31:35,083  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Take this.

704
01:31:36,997 --> 01:31:39,227  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What is it? - Take it.

705
01:31:45,839 --> 01:31:50,139  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I saved it up for you. Take it and fly to Turkey.

706
01:31:52,545 --> 01:31:54,843  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I can't. - Go on! Take it!

707
01:31:55,482 --> 01:31:58,713  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, I can't. I'm sorry.

708
01:31:59,085 --> 01:32:03,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
For fuck's sake! I am your uncle after all.

709
01:32:04,524 --> 01:32:06,082  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Or have you forgotten?

710
01:32:11,364 --> 01:32:13,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come on. Take it and fly to Turkey.

711
01:32:22,342 --> 01:32:23,331  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thanks.

712
01:32:37,824 --> 01:32:39,052  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Brother-in-law?

713
01:32:42,896 --> 01:32:44,454  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where is your sister?

714
01:32:47,133 --> 01:32:48,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I have no sister now.

715
01:32:50,704 --> 01:32:52,501  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You have the same mother.

716
01:32:56,876 --> 01:32:58,537  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What does your mother think?

717
01:33:00,580 --> 01:33:02,480  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We had to save our honor.

718
01:33:03,016 --> 01:33:04,381  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't you see?

719
01:33:05,418 --> 01:33:06,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And?

720
01:33:07,354 --> 01:33:09,379  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Did you save it, your honor?

721
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:41,951  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where to?

722
01:33:43,056 --> 01:33:44,455  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I don't know.

723
01:33:44,824 --> 01:33:49,420  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
If you don't know, how should l? - Just drive straight on.

724
01:33:50,563 --> 01:33:51,495  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Okay.

725
01:33:53,466 --> 01:33:56,765  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where are you from? - Hamburg.

726
01:33:57,137 --> 01:34:00,197  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hamburg? You're from Hamburg?

727
01:34:01,908 --> 01:34:05,571  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes. - Hey, dude! I'm from Munich!
- Oh God, you're Bavarian?

728
01:34:05,945 --> 01:34:08,971  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
In my last life I was Bavarian, but now l'm here.

729
01:34:09,482 --> 01:34:11,211  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Bastards threw me out.

730
01:34:11,551 --> 01:34:15,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Threw me out, see? Like the baby with the bathwater.

731
01:34:16,356 --> 01:34:18,984  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why'd they do it? - Drugs.

732
01:34:19,926 --> 01:34:21,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Aha...

733
01:34:22,896 --> 01:34:24,659  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We can't go straight much further.

734
01:34:25,031 --> 01:34:27,829  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I have to turn. Left or right. Say something.

735
01:34:28,201 --> 01:34:30,692  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Take me to a cheap hotel, yeah?

736
01:34:31,404 --> 01:34:34,464  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There's... there's the... I know!

737
01:34:34,641 --> 01:34:42,776  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I have just the thing for you,
the''Grand Hotel London.'' - Looks cosy.

738
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:50,083  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Just between you and me... the place is haunted.

739
01:35:16,416 --> 01:35:18,384  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I like howthey use the logo.

740
01:35:18,751 --> 01:35:20,742  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They had it at the top and large.

741
01:35:21,287 --> 01:35:24,381  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But in this mock-up, it's too small.

742
01:35:24,724 --> 01:35:26,658  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'd like to have it big.

743
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:29,424  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I don't like this font.

744
01:35:29,963 --> 01:35:32,295  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We have to choose one ofthese.

745
01:35:32,832 --> 01:35:34,629  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do you have other samples?

746
01:35:35,001 --> 01:35:37,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There's someone here to see you. - Who?

747
01:35:43,610 --> 01:35:46,738  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Could we continue this later? - Certainly.

748
01:35:58,124 --> 01:35:59,250  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hello, Selma.

749
01:36:01,294 --> 01:36:02,454  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Welcome.

750
01:36:03,129 --> 01:36:04,426  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thankyou.

751
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:06,724  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Have a seat.

752
01:36:07,367 --> 01:36:08,698  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thankyou.

753
01:36:16,643 --> 01:36:20,101  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I hope you made it through alright. - Thanks.

754
01:36:22,682 --> 01:36:24,013  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How are you?

755
01:36:25,785 --> 01:36:26,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Fine.

756
01:36:27,620 --> 01:36:28,985  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And yourself?

757
01:36:29,856 --> 01:36:31,346  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
As you can see...

758
01:36:31,691 --> 01:36:34,159  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm still single...

759
01:36:40,934 --> 01:36:44,165  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Could l have a glass ofwater? - I apologize.

760
01:36:44,537 --> 01:36:49,531  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Bring the gentleman a glass ofwater,
and a red wine for me, please.

761
01:36:55,481 --> 01:36:58,211  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This is for you. - You shouldn't have.

762
01:36:58,585 --> 01:37:02,622  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't mention it. - Thank you. Where are you staying?

763
01:37:02,622 --> 01:37:05,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
At the ''Grand Hotel London.''

764
01:37:05,892 --> 01:37:08,884  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A nice hotel. - lt's not bad.

765
01:37:14,067 --> 01:37:15,056  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thank you.

766
01:37:21,341 --> 01:37:22,706  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where is Sibel?

767
01:37:25,245 --> 01:37:27,042  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She's here in Istanbul.

768
01:37:31,251 --> 01:37:33,014  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Take me to her, please.

769
01:37:34,787 --> 01:37:36,778  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I can't. - Why not?

770
01:37:37,657 --> 01:37:39,818  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She has a new life. She's happy.

771
01:37:40,193 --> 01:37:44,289  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She has a boyfriend. She has a daughter.
She doesn't need you.

772
01:38:44,857 --> 01:38:47,883  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'd lost myself.

773
01:39:19,592 --> 01:39:21,253  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do you understand that?

774
01:39:51,691 --> 01:39:52,623  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No.

775
01:39:55,328 --> 01:39:56,693  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm not.

776
01:40:57,623 --> 01:40:58,555  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hello?

777
01:41:01,093 --> 01:41:01,991  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hello?

778
01:41:02,929 --> 01:41:03,861  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Cahit?

779
01:41:10,203 --> 01:41:11,135  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sibel?

780
01:41:13,806 --> 01:41:16,934  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Cahit, I can't talk now. How long are you here?

781
01:41:17,477 --> 01:41:19,809  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
As long as it takes to see you.

782
01:41:23,683 --> 01:41:24,615  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hello?

783
01:42:18,471 --> 01:42:20,302  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There's a call for you.

784
01:42:26,679 --> 01:42:29,239  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Cem has gone to Zonguldakfortwo days.

785
01:42:33,119 --> 01:42:34,814  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I won't be coming home tonight.

786
01:42:43,930 --> 01:42:45,693  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Can you look after Pamuk?

787
01:42:46,065 --> 01:42:48,226  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sweetie, you gonna stay with me tonight?

788
01:42:56,509 --> 01:42:58,739  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I might not be back tomorrow, either.

789
01:43:00,613 --> 01:43:03,104  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But you'll be back sometime, won't you?

790
01:43:15,795 --> 01:43:18,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I hope you knowwhat you're doing.

791
01:43:20,733 --> 01:43:22,530  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, I don't.

792
01:43:24,236 --> 01:43:25,567  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Oh, Sibel!

793
01:43:26,072 --> 01:43:27,539  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I wish you all the best.

794
01:44:25,064 --> 01:44:26,691  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What are your plans?

795
01:44:28,834 --> 01:44:33,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do you want to stay in Istanbul?
- Stay in Istanbul? Definitely not, no.

796
01:44:35,141 --> 01:44:38,372  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm going to Mersin, where I was born.

797
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:43,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm not worried.

798
01:44:44,417 --> 01:44:45,850  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's nice.

799
01:45:06,238 --> 01:45:08,968  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Will you come with me?

800
01:45:30,429 --> 01:45:32,124  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let's go back inside.

801
01:46:31,490 --> 01:46:32,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's me.

802
01:46:33,559 --> 01:46:34,491  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Fine.

803
01:46:36,529 --> 01:46:38,087  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's Pamuk doing?

804
01:46:39,532 --> 01:46:41,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let me speakto her, please.

805
01:46:52,511 --> 01:46:54,138  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How should we do it?

806
01:46:57,583 --> 01:47:00,051  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We meet at the bus station tomorrow

807
01:47:02,354 --> 01:47:04,948  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and take the bus to Mersin from there.

808
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:08,858  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You,

809
01:47:09,929 --> 01:47:11,829  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
your daughter and me.

810
01:47:49,268 --> 01:47:54,934  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What time? - At twelve.

811
01:49:55,961 --> 01:49:59,795  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Overthere on the mountain

812
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:04,800  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A beacon is burning

813
01:50:18,183 --> 01:50:22,950  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Falcons fly over its shimmering light...

814
01:50:34,666 --> 01:50:39,365  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Have all those who love And who have lost their lovers

815
01:50:39,872 --> 01:50:42,705  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Lost their senses like me?

816
01:50:57,389 --> 01:51:01,189  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l am infinitely sad...

817
01:51:05,998 --> 01:51:09,798  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
May my enemies go blind...

818
01:51:14,606 --> 01:51:17,473  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l lost my mind...

819
01:51:27,319 --> 01:51:31,153  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Maythe mountains rejoice in my stead.
