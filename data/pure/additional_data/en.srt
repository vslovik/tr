00:00:02,006 --> 00:00:30,006
Kikina presents

2
00:01:14,047 --> 00:01:18,199
Prep. Nikonov S.

3
00:04:09,087 --> 00:04:10,679
You'll catch your death
of pneumonia, mister.

4
00:04:18,527 --> 00:04:21,121
Please... let's see some ID.

5
00:04:33,247 --> 00:04:34,282
I must've...

6
00:04:35,687 --> 00:04:37,200
I must've let it in...

7
00:04:50,607 --> 00:04:51,802
Pneumonia for sure, mister.

8
00:05:08,887 --> 00:05:10,036
You'll be warmer.

9
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:15,723
How long am I to stay in this shithouse?

10
00:05:16,087 --> 00:05:17,042
Relax.

11
00:05:17,807 --> 00:05:19,001
The Inspector's been told.

12
00:05:19,847 --> 00:05:20,962
He's on his way.

13
00:05:21,327 --> 00:05:23,045
At least you're dry.

14
00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:25,940
You must be joking!

15
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:31,004
It's like a cheap American film.
When do you read me my rights?

16
00:05:33,287 --> 00:05:35,482
You can take off your shoes if you want.

17
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,962
I wet myself.

18
00:05:50,847 --> 00:05:52,519
It happens sometimes.

19
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:54,522
When you're old.

20
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:58,756
Isn't that so?

21
00:06:19,327 --> 00:06:21,124
I have to make a call.
Where's the phone?

22
00:06:22,087 --> 00:06:23,805
Sorry, that's not possible.

23
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,280
What d'you mean
- not possible?

24
00:06:26,647 --> 00:06:29,241
It's my right! I have to
tell them I'll be late.

25
00:06:29,447 --> 00:06:31,244
Drop it, it's not possible.

26
00:06:31,447 --> 00:06:33,438
Ask the Inspector when he gets here.

27
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:36,556
Whoever you are,

28
00:06:36,807 --> 00:06:38,843
I'll also tell him

29
00:06:39,047 --> 00:06:40,844
how you treated me. You're in trouble.

30
00:06:41,047 --> 00:06:42,560
I'm not some nobody!

31
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:44,917
I don't have the honor of knowing you.

32
00:06:45,127 --> 00:06:48,437
But whoever you are, you'll see
we don't play favorites here!

33
00:06:48,647 --> 00:06:50,399
Get that through your head!

34
00:06:51,207 --> 00:06:53,198
Tell the Inspector anything you like.

35
00:07:19,287 --> 00:07:21,801
Can you tell me the time or
do I have to wait for Bogart?

36
00:07:25,367 --> 00:07:26,739
It's 9:15.

37
00:07:29,087 --> 00:07:31,645
9:15. Shit. Oh, shit!

38
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:54,602
Shut up!

39
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,879
- Out that whistling! It drives me nuts!
- Sit down!...

40
00:07:58,087 --> 00:07:59,122
And keep quiet!

41
00:08:03,847 --> 00:08:04,836
Sorry...

42
00:08:05,447 --> 00:08:06,436
I apologize.

43
00:08:07,127 --> 00:08:08,719
It's just that I'm expected.

44
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:11,079
I have a very important meeting.

45
00:08:11,447 --> 00:08:12,323
Very important.

46
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:17,646
With the Minister of Culture.

47
00:08:20,287 --> 00:08:21,356
I have to prepare myself...

48
00:08:22,007 --> 00:08:23,156
I can't go like...

49
00:08:23,367 --> 00:08:25,403
The Inspector's on his way.

50
00:08:36,887 --> 00:08:38,081
Got a cigarette?

51
00:08:39,087 --> 00:08:40,520
Find him a cigarette.

52
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:42,720
But, captain, I don't smoke.

53
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:44,077
Me neither.

54
00:08:47,367 --> 00:08:48,925
The Inspector smokes, I hope.

55
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,120
An Inspector always smokes.

56
00:08:52,487 --> 00:08:53,920
An Inspector smokes a pipe...

57
00:08:54,327 --> 00:08:56,238
An Inspector chomps on a cigar...

58
00:08:58,527 --> 00:09:00,006
Drink this, It'll do you good.

59
00:09:02,527 --> 00:09:03,482
Take it.

60
00:09:06,127 --> 00:09:07,003
Drink.

61
00:09:08,087 --> 00:09:09,645
It'll warm you. Drink.

62
00:09:12,487 --> 00:09:14,318
- Is it milk?
- Yes, warm milk.

63
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:17,884
It'll do you good. Go on.

64
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:20,602
Drink.

65
00:09:22,767 --> 00:09:23,722
Drink.

66
00:09:36,527 --> 00:09:37,960
You son of a bitch!

67
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:39,282
Bastard!

68
00:09:44,727 --> 00:09:46,080
Bastard!

69
00:10:25,127 --> 00:10:26,765
A nasty business.

70
00:10:27,287 --> 00:10:29,357
We really needed this.

71
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:31,444
With this rain, I was

72
00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:32,636
better off in bed.

73
00:10:33,327 --> 00:10:34,442
He's coming around.

74
00:10:37,047 --> 00:10:38,526
Try to sit up.

75
00:10:40,687 --> 00:10:42,166
Give him a hand.

76
00:10:42,687 --> 00:10:45,804
I'll manage, leave me alone.

77
00:11:06,727 --> 00:11:08,683
I assume you're the Inspector.

78
00:11:12,847 --> 00:11:14,485
Excellent assumption.

79
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:18,686
Well, then you owe
me a few explanations.

80
00:11:21,367 --> 00:11:23,562
By what right are you holding me here?

81
00:11:23,887 --> 00:11:27,118
Why wouldn't your men
let me contact my family?

82
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:30,439
Who authorized them to
beat me like an animal?

83
00:11:33,447 --> 00:11:34,516
Answer me.

84
00:11:36,407 --> 00:11:38,637
I asked you three simple questions.

85
00:11:39,007 --> 00:11:41,282
Ordinarily I'm the
one who asks questions.

86
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:45,244
From what I hear, you
brought this on yourself.

87
00:11:45,447 --> 00:11:47,244
Nonetheless, I'm sorry I'm late.

88
00:11:48,487 --> 00:11:51,321
- As a rule, I'm quite punctual...
- I don't care how punctual you are!

89
00:11:54,767 --> 00:11:56,439
I have no desire to know it.

90
00:11:56,567 --> 00:11:59,206
I just want to know what I'm doing here.

91
00:12:02,127 --> 00:12:04,721
I'll try to satisfy your curiosity.

92
00:12:08,647 --> 00:12:11,002
But first I'd like to
know who I'm dealing with.

93
00:12:12,087 --> 00:12:13,839
Seeing as you were out walking

94
00:12:14,047 --> 00:12:17,164
miles from anywhere in a
downpour, with no raincoat

95
00:12:17,367 --> 00:12:19,756
no... umbrella, nothing in your pockets,

96
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,601
not even any ID...

97
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:24,321
It's neither a felony nor a
misdemeanor to be without ID.

98
00:12:25,847 --> 00:12:29,044
It must be in my wallet on my desk...

99
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,240
- Naturally.
- ...or in another jacket.

100
00:12:32,487 --> 00:12:33,806
But first,

101
00:12:34,407 --> 00:12:36,841
I'd like to know who
it is I'm talking to.

102
00:12:37,527 --> 00:12:40,883
A trucker? A boxer, a
dentist, an astrologer?

103
00:12:41,847 --> 00:12:44,077
Maybe a judge, since you are such
an expert on felony and misdemeanor,

104
00:12:44,287 --> 00:12:46,084
crimes?

105
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:49,561
Once people knew who I was
before I even said hello.

106
00:12:49,887 --> 00:12:51,320
But I don't want to...

107
00:12:52,127 --> 00:12:53,924
take advantage of my celebrity.

108
00:12:56,687 --> 00:12:57,597
No...

109
00:13:00,007 --> 00:13:01,520
My name is Onoff.

110
00:13:02,447 --> 00:13:04,403
And mine is Leonardo Da Vinci.

111
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,521
You don't believe me?

112
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:12,595
That's your right.

113
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,483
What's perhaps less your right

114
00:13:17,767 --> 00:13:19,644
is arresting people simply for

115
00:13:19,847 --> 00:13:20,916
walking in the rain.

116
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,356
Does rain bother you so much

117
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:27,365
mister Leonardo Da Vinci?

118
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:33,325
I am Onoff.

119
00:13:33,807 --> 00:13:37,482
If you doubt me, go get my
ID or send your henchmen,

120
00:13:37,687 --> 00:13:38,563
It's your work.

121
00:13:39,247 --> 00:13:42,398
I own the farmhouse on the
River Choron. I must've left it

122
00:13:42,607 --> 00:13:44,086
on the kitchen table

123
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:46,484
or in a shirt pocket or on my bed.

124
00:13:46,687 --> 00:13:48,917
"Even now I sometimes doubt I ever...

125
00:13:49,207 --> 00:13:50,196
lived those days,

126
00:13:52,727 --> 00:13:54,683
ever made fast that friendship,

127
00:13:55,687 --> 00:13:58,838
ever knew this man whose body
has just fallen before my eyes.

128
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:02,082
This body gasped for breath,

129
00:14:03,087 --> 00:14:04,440
and I wrote these pages.

130
00:14:07,607 --> 00:14:09,723
Those vacant eyes cried
out for expression,

131
00:14:10,087 --> 00:14:12,442
those lips pleaded for a final whimper,

132
00:14:12,807 --> 00:14:15,401
this dream was missing
a kind of dreamer..."

133
00:14:16,767 --> 00:14:20,077
Charming little speech.
And very well-said.

134
00:14:20,607 --> 00:14:23,883
But it leaves me cold. I don't
understand it, Mr. Da Vinci.

135
00:14:24,087 --> 00:14:26,123
What you call my little speech

136
00:14:26,327 --> 00:14:29,842
is quite simply a quote from a
great novel by a writer named Onoff!

137
00:14:31,087 --> 00:14:32,042
Onoff...

138
00:14:33,447 --> 00:14:35,642
You really have no luck, do you?

139
00:14:36,047 --> 00:14:37,196
No luck at all!

140
00:14:37,447 --> 00:14:40,837
Because in a place like this
where nothing ever happens,

141
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,605
you have plenty of time to read.

142
00:14:43,087 --> 00:14:44,679
And I read a lot,

143
00:14:45,207 --> 00:14:47,675
days on end, weeks on end,

144
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,720
book after book, book after book...

145
00:14:50,927 --> 00:14:53,805
You can't imagine the
number of books I read,

146
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:56,635
even re-read the ones I like best:

147
00:14:56,967 --> 00:14:59,765
"The Palace of Nine
Frontiers", "Degrees",

148
00:15:00,087 --> 00:15:01,076
"Hatred",

149
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,036
"Geometry",

150
00:15:04,007 --> 00:15:05,360
"A Treatise on Pleasure",

151
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:07,319
"Nero", "The Two Torches"...

152
00:15:08,087 --> 00:15:09,805
All books by Onoff.

153
00:15:10,007 --> 00:15:11,599
He's my favorite writer.

154
00:15:12,207 --> 00:15:14,243
In my humble opinion, he's a genius.

155
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:17,516
You couldn’t have made a worse choice.

156
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:18,957
Onoff...

157
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:21,437
I know his biography
like the back of my hand.

158
00:15:23,207 --> 00:15:24,526
You see, old man,

159
00:15:24,727 --> 00:15:27,764
walking in the rain at night
isn't too serious by itself.

160
00:15:28,287 --> 00:15:32,326
Leaving your ID at home in a
jacket pocket is merely stupid.

161
00:15:32,847 --> 00:15:34,883
Attempting to escape police custody,

162
00:15:35,607 --> 00:15:38,917
even the most inept, by
assaulting officers of the law

163
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:40,722
is a bit riskier.

164
00:15:41,287 --> 00:15:44,040
But doing it all in the
space of a few hours,

165
00:15:44,647 --> 00:15:46,763
then giving a false identity,

166
00:15:48,487 --> 00:15:50,921
that's... very, very risky.

167
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,763
Andre!

168
00:16:08,487 --> 00:16:10,638
I'm ready, sir!

169
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,764
It may not be necessary, I doubt
it'll take long. Who is winning?

170
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:25,399
Me, but he has the Mikado. The Mikado doesn't
beat a steady hand. Fix me a cup of coffee.

171
00:16:32,407 --> 00:16:33,317
Stand up.

172
00:17:04,367 --> 00:17:05,686
What's your name?

173
00:17:20,087 --> 00:17:22,043
Let's not waste time. Your name?

174
00:17:24,807 --> 00:17:26,240
What's your name?

175
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:30,116
What's your name? Shit!

176
00:17:31,727 --> 00:17:33,524
"He was standing by the armoire

177
00:17:34,247 --> 00:17:35,805
when Mrs. d'Oneiras' car

178
00:17:36,007 --> 00:17:37,326
drove into the courtyard.

179
00:17:39,247 --> 00:17:41,363
The maid hurried out.

180
00:17:43,127 --> 00:17:44,685
She held the door open,

181
00:17:45,527 --> 00:17:46,676
curtseyed,

182
00:17:47,527 --> 00:17:49,245
then ushered her in.

183
00:17:51,007 --> 00:17:54,283
Mrs. d'Oneiras slowly climbed
the semicircular staircase.

184
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,001
She was beautiful.

185
00:17:57,767 --> 00:18:00,998
She took a morsel of cooked
fish from the pocket of her skirt

186
00:18:01,367 --> 00:18:02,880
and proceeded to eat it.

187
00:18:06,527 --> 00:18:08,597
As she ate, she stared straight ahead,

188
00:18:09,127 --> 00:18:10,446
seeing nothing...

189
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:12,716
When she came in,

190
00:18:13,847 --> 00:18:15,485
he moved away from the armoire

191
00:18:15,807 --> 00:18:18,719
and went toward her, but
she didn’t look at him.

192
00:18:19,087 --> 00:18:22,284
She passed by him,
barely a centimeter away,

193
00:18:22,807 --> 00:18:24,286
as if he didn't exist."

194
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:29,524
That Mrs. d'Oneiras...

195
00:18:30,087 --> 00:18:32,760
The bit of herring
in the skirt pocket...

196
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,400
That's from "Degrees".

197
00:18:39,407 --> 00:18:42,683
It's when Mrs. d'Oneiras
breaks off with him.

198
00:18:44,247 --> 00:18:45,839
The middle of the book.

199
00:18:46,247 --> 00:18:47,441
Not "Degrees".

200
00:18:49,047 --> 00:18:51,083
"Stairways", Inspector.

201
00:18:51,767 --> 00:18:52,836
"Stairways",

202
00:18:53,327 --> 00:18:54,885
chapter three,

203
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,646
"The return of the Druze".

204
00:18:56,967 --> 00:19:01,277
Giving a false identity is very
risky, Leonardo Da Vinci, old prick!

205
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:17,442
Prince Cosimo's speech,
before laying the tiles?

206
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:22,997
"That's why I followed you here,

207
00:19:23,527 --> 00:19:24,437
and that's why

208
00:19:24,647 --> 00:19:26,638
this park if full of kneeling men..."

209
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,360
"...and derelict dancers..."

210
00:19:28,887 --> 00:19:30,797
"And that's why

211
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,199
in this frescoed corner,
where these two walls meet..."

212
00:19:33,767 --> 00:19:35,998
"...you see squatting figures,
defecating in the shadows."

213
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:38,602
Correct?

214
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:42,922
You say you know my biography
like the back if your hand.

215
00:19:44,247 --> 00:19:45,680
I am 48 years old.

216
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:49,085
I've written novels,
articles, songs, plays.

217
00:19:50,287 --> 00:19:52,324
I myself directed, very
badly, my last play, "Nero".

218
00:19:52,887 --> 00:19:53,876
I've published nothing

219
00:19:54,087 --> 00:19:55,122
for 6 years.

220
00:19:55,887 --> 00:19:58,240
Is that enough?

221
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,722
Onoff!

222
00:20:06,287 --> 00:20:08,357
The great Onoff, here!

223
00:20:10,687 --> 00:20:12,757
How could I not have
recognized you right away?

224
00:20:13,527 --> 00:20:14,961
It's... I... What can
I say to apologize?

225
00:20:15,327 --> 00:20:17,124
Allow me to shake your hand.

226
00:20:21,407 --> 00:20:23,284
I am sorry about

227
00:20:23,487 --> 00:20:26,047
the shabby welcome we gave you.

228
00:20:26,247 --> 00:20:28,238
Never mind. Not a big deal.

229
00:20:28,447 --> 00:20:30,085
You're soaking wet!

230
00:20:30,287 --> 00:20:32,084
Towels, quickly, and dry clothes!

231
00:20:32,967 --> 00:20:34,559
And shoes, too.

232
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:35,916
Would you like coffee?

233
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:37,402
Another coffee!

234
00:20:37,607 --> 00:20:39,040
Just a moment, Mr. Inspector.

235
00:20:39,247 --> 00:20:42,637
May I make a call?

236
00:20:45,207 --> 00:20:46,322
Well, of course, but...

237
00:20:54,047 --> 00:20:55,480
The lines are busy.

238
00:20:56,327 --> 00:20:58,204
How... how...

239
00:20:58,407 --> 00:21:00,875
How could I possibly have
failed to recognize you?

240
00:21:01,847 --> 00:21:04,361
I must have seen your
face hundreds of times.

241
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:08,157
You know, flash bulbs,
news, shots, TV...

242
00:21:08,607 --> 00:21:11,804
- They conceal more than reveal.
- Of course, but...

243
00:21:12,447 --> 00:21:13,357
What is someone like you

244
00:21:13,927 --> 00:21:15,838
doing here in the middle of nowhere?

245
00:21:16,047 --> 00:21:19,323
- I owe a house in the mountain, where sometimes...
- Women!

246
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:22,719
If it pleases you to think so...

247
00:21:23,687 --> 00:21:26,804
I shouldn't pry into
what doesn't concern me.

248
00:21:27,007 --> 00:21:28,998
I'm seldom here, unfortunately.

249
00:21:29,807 --> 00:21:32,480
I go there to work. It
helps me concentrate.

250
00:21:33,487 --> 00:21:34,715
A new book?

251
00:21:35,607 --> 00:21:37,757
You are writing a new book,
er! I've guessed, have I?

252
00:21:39,327 --> 00:21:41,966
Bravo, you've guessed.

253
00:21:42,847 --> 00:21:45,202
And... have you been here long?

254
00:21:46,047 --> 00:21:47,446
Three or four days.

255
00:21:47,647 --> 00:21:50,400
I got there Thursday, today's
Sunday. That makes four.

256
00:21:53,847 --> 00:21:54,757
The beard!

257
00:21:54,967 --> 00:21:56,116
That's it!

258
00:21:57,047 --> 00:21:58,924
You always had a beard,

259
00:21:59,127 --> 00:22:00,799
that's why I didn't recognize you!

260
00:22:12,807 --> 00:22:14,240
Coffee, Mr. Inspector.

261
00:23:20,647 --> 00:23:23,844
I brought you shoes.
Can you open the door?

262
00:23:23,967 --> 00:23:26,036
Yes, I am going.

263
00:23:26,647 --> 00:23:27,602
I am going.

264
00:23:44,327 --> 00:23:45,885
The gardener's boots.

265
00:23:46,087 --> 00:23:48,555
A bit too big, but at least they're dry.

266
00:23:48,767 --> 00:23:51,076
Doesn't matter. Thanks. Thanks.

267
00:23:51,287 --> 00:23:54,597
Sorry about what happened
earlier. How is your hand?

268
00:23:56,767 --> 00:23:58,120
Don't worry.

269
00:23:58,487 --> 00:23:59,636
I'll survive.

270
00:24:00,247 --> 00:24:01,521
Thanks for the boots.

271
00:26:03,647 --> 00:26:05,797
Well, Inspector, nothing
left but to thank you

272
00:26:06,007 --> 00:26:07,884
for your kind words about my work.

273
00:26:08,087 --> 00:26:10,725
No, I'm the one to thank you.

274
00:26:11,447 --> 00:26:12,438
You don't know

275
00:26:12,647 --> 00:26:14,319
how happy I am to have met you,

276
00:26:14,527 --> 00:26:17,166
to have shaken the hand
that creates the world

277
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,119
where I so enjoyed living.

278
00:26:18,407 --> 00:26:21,716
I wouldn't like to abuse
your hospitality but,

279
00:26:22,127 --> 00:26:24,163
if you could have me driven home...

280
00:26:25,727 --> 00:26:27,080
Yes, of course.

281
00:26:27,327 --> 00:26:30,238
That way, I can return
the clothes and the boots.

282
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:32,326
Of course.

283
00:26:32,847 --> 00:26:36,123
Of course, but... this is very
awkward... how to tell you...

284
00:26:36,327 --> 00:26:38,602
My ID? I'll send that back, too.

285
00:26:39,927 --> 00:26:41,440
No, it's not that.

286
00:26:41,807 --> 00:26:43,206
What is it, then?

287
00:26:44,007 --> 00:26:46,123
Nothing serious, I assure you...

288
00:26:46,687 --> 00:26:47,563
But...

289
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:52,762
You'll have to stay a while longer.

290
00:27:01,167 --> 00:27:03,842
- All right, if you think it's necessary...
- As I said,

291
00:27:05,047 --> 00:27:07,925
nothing major. A few
questions. Just a formality.

292
00:27:12,407 --> 00:27:14,716
It won't take long.

293
00:27:15,247 --> 00:27:17,807
I'd appreciate that, I'm very tired.

294
00:27:18,167 --> 00:27:21,123
You wanted to make a phone call.

295
00:27:23,647 --> 00:27:25,638
Give me a number, I'll
have it put through.

296
00:27:26,927 --> 00:27:28,406
9363...

297
00:27:28,607 --> 00:27:30,757
3396.

298
00:27:31,727 --> 00:27:33,877
93633396.

299
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:35,920
Easy to remember.

300
00:27:37,727 --> 00:27:38,876
Is it your number?

301
00:27:40,007 --> 00:27:40,757
No...

302
00:27:41,447 --> 00:27:43,005
A lady friend of mine.

303
00:27:47,487 --> 00:27:48,124
Andre...

304
00:27:51,887 --> 00:27:54,526
Put this number through
to my direct line, 93...

305
00:27:54,727 --> 00:27:55,921
63...

306
00:27:56,247 --> 00:27:57,362
3396.

307
00:27:58,527 --> 00:27:59,437
93...

308
00:27:59,647 --> 00:28:01,638
633396.

309
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:08,079
What's the subject of your new book?

310
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:11,080
Is this an interview?

311
00:28:11,287 --> 00:28:13,323
Since you know me so well,

312
00:28:13,527 --> 00:28:14,960
you know I quit giving them years ago.

313
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:17,758
Yes, of course.

314
00:28:17,967 --> 00:28:19,798
Though I never understood why.

315
00:28:20,007 --> 00:28:21,235
Interviews

316
00:28:21,447 --> 00:28:22,402
are pointless.

317
00:28:23,127 --> 00:28:25,960
Someone visits you to make you say,

318
00:28:26,167 --> 00:28:29,045
what he already knows, for the
pleasure of hearing you repeat it.

319
00:28:29,247 --> 00:28:30,965
In a way, yes.

320
00:28:31,327 --> 00:28:32,760
But it's different with me.

321
00:28:33,687 --> 00:28:36,599
I want you to tell me
everything you did today.

322
00:28:38,687 --> 00:28:39,802
Today, Sunday.

323
00:28:40,287 --> 00:28:42,198
And that, I assure you,
is something I don't know.

324
00:28:42,199 --> 00:28:44,486
So it's not an interview.

325
00:28:45,287 --> 00:28:46,481
It's an interrogation.

326
00:28:47,447 --> 00:28:51,076
Call it what you like... But
I ask you to bear with me.

327
00:28:51,807 --> 00:28:54,321
It's not easy to put these questions

328
00:28:54,527 --> 00:28:56,882
to a man I admire so much.
- Then don't do it.

329
00:28:57,127 --> 00:28:58,719
I must, Mr. Onoff.

330
00:28:59,327 --> 00:29:00,476
I must.

331
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:02,996
It's your own interest.

332
00:29:03,207 --> 00:29:05,038
As you see, we are alone,

333
00:29:05,247 --> 00:29:06,965
noting you say will be taken down.

334
00:29:07,407 --> 00:29:09,967
Tell me how you spent your day,

335
00:29:10,567 --> 00:29:13,798
and when you are finished,
I give you my word,

336
00:29:14,327 --> 00:29:15,521
we'll leave you in peace.

337
00:29:19,447 --> 00:29:20,482
Got a cigarette?

338
00:29:21,527 --> 00:29:23,836
I am sorry, nobody here smokes...

339
00:29:24,047 --> 00:29:27,119
All right, never mind. Forget it.

340
00:29:28,247 --> 00:29:29,999
You smoke a lot?

341
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,247
Three packs a day. A bit more lately.

342
00:29:35,447 --> 00:29:36,163
And today?

343
00:29:36,727 --> 00:29:38,604
Today I broke all records.

344
00:29:42,727 --> 00:29:44,287
What time did you wake up this morning?

345
00:29:44,687 --> 00:29:45,915
3:30.

346
00:29:48,567 --> 00:29:51,365
I always wake up in 3:30 in the morning.

347
00:29:51,567 --> 00:29:53,125
How can you be so precise?

348
00:29:53,687 --> 00:29:54,802
I don't sleep much.

349
00:29:56,007 --> 00:29:58,396
An hour, an hour and a
half... Never more than two.

350
00:29:58,767 --> 00:30:02,237
Every day for the last ten years I've
woken up at exactly 3:30 in the morning.

351
00:30:02,447 --> 00:30:04,597
Just like Shannon in "Geometry".

352
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:07,196
Right, like the hero of "Geometry".

353
00:30:07,887 --> 00:30:10,117
- It's an obsession with you.
- I guess it is.

354
00:30:11,007 --> 00:30:13,237
I must say I was surprised

355
00:30:13,447 --> 00:30:15,836
when you didn't recognize my quote:

356
00:30:16,567 --> 00:30:18,478
"Those lips pleaded for a final
whimper". It's magnificent...

357
00:30:18,687 --> 00:30:21,076
Do you remember the
names of all you suspects?

358
00:30:21,727 --> 00:30:24,241
Everyone you arrested,
questioned, sent to jail?

359
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:26,483
You remember their faces, their hair,

360
00:30:27,167 --> 00:30:28,725
every word they said?

361
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:30,326
Frankly, I doubt it.

362
00:30:30,527 --> 00:30:32,245
No one can remember everything.

363
00:30:32,807 --> 00:30:35,844
That passage you quoted, might be from

364
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,805
"The Palace...", maybe...

365
00:30:38,247 --> 00:30:40,203
That's it, that's it!

366
00:30:40,927 --> 00:30:42,963
Beginning of the last
chapter! It is magnificent!

367
00:30:43,527 --> 00:30:46,360
We were discussing insomnia.

368
00:30:46,607 --> 00:30:50,202
Yes. I had insomnia, too. For years.

369
00:30:51,007 --> 00:30:54,317
I tried everything, every
remedy possible or imaginable...

370
00:30:54,527 --> 00:30:57,803
Sleeping pills by truckload.

371
00:30:58,607 --> 00:30:59,801
Nothing helped.

372
00:31:00,007 --> 00:31:02,237
Then, a few years ago,

373
00:31:02,767 --> 00:31:03,964
all at once it stopped,

374
00:31:05,047 --> 00:31:05,957
like that. Overnight.

375
00:31:08,687 --> 00:31:11,281
Don't lose hope. Maybe
it'll happen to you.

376
00:31:11,487 --> 00:31:13,842
I don't want my insomnia cured.

377
00:31:14,207 --> 00:31:16,323
It suits me fine,

378
00:31:16,527 --> 00:31:20,042
it's my number-one collaborator. It
means I can write while others sleep.

379
00:31:20,807 --> 00:31:22,604
Did you also work last night?

380
00:31:23,167 --> 00:31:25,362
- Less than usual.
- Did you went back to sleep?

381
00:31:25,607 --> 00:31:26,005
No...

382
00:31:26,207 --> 00:31:27,402
No? Then, what did you do?

383
00:31:27,687 --> 00:31:29,643
I stared for ages at the ceiling.

384
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:31,838
And the ceiling stared for ages at me.

385
00:31:34,687 --> 00:31:35,597
Alone?

386
00:31:36,367 --> 00:31:38,278
I mean, you were alone in bed?

387
00:31:38,847 --> 00:31:41,759
You, Inspector, are a
man of boundless tact.

388
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:42,956
Yes, I was alone.

389
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:45,680
You were alone. And then?

390
00:31:45,681 --> 00:31:47,119
Then I got up

391
00:31:47,327 --> 00:31:48,396
before cock-crow.

392
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:51,725
I put on my robe

393
00:31:51,927 --> 00:31:53,440
and my slippers, one by one.

394
00:31:54,647 --> 00:31:56,046
I went down to the kitchen.

395
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:58,761
I drank a cup of coffee
accompanied by a spoonful of sugar.

396
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,759
I took a huge crap.

397
00:32:01,727 --> 00:32:03,206
I scratched my head.

398
00:32:03,407 --> 00:32:04,556
I washed myself,

399
00:32:05,047 --> 00:32:05,843
dressed.

400
00:32:06,807 --> 00:32:08,126
Made a phone call,

401
00:32:09,287 --> 00:32:11,723
tore up everything
I'd written yesterday,

402
00:32:13,007 --> 00:32:13,962
and made notes

403
00:32:14,167 --> 00:32:15,600
on what I'd write tomorrow.

404
00:32:16,207 --> 00:32:17,242
And then

405
00:32:17,447 --> 00:32:18,482
I went for a walk.

406
00:32:19,607 --> 00:32:21,643
After that I came back home

407
00:32:21,847 --> 00:32:23,917
and reorganized the attic.

408
00:32:25,927 --> 00:32:26,882
And then?

409
00:32:29,487 --> 00:32:30,237
Then,

410
00:32:31,007 --> 00:32:33,441
I drove to the train
station to pick up my agent.

411
00:32:35,407 --> 00:32:36,726
What's your agent's name?

412
00:32:36,847 --> 00:32:38,758
- Danielle.
- Danielle what?

413
00:32:41,087 --> 00:32:42,122
Danielle February.

414
00:32:43,567 --> 00:32:47,037
You drove to the train station
to pick up Danielle February?

415
00:32:47,247 --> 00:32:48,202
- Yes.
- Then?

416
00:32:48,447 --> 00:32:49,197
We had lunch,

417
00:32:49,407 --> 00:32:51,079
we talked about work...

418
00:32:51,767 --> 00:32:53,120
Later on I took her back.

419
00:32:53,327 --> 00:32:54,282
- Where?
- To the station.

420
00:32:54,487 --> 00:32:55,237
What time?

421
00:32:57,367 --> 00:32:59,358
Between 5 and 6 in the evening.

422
00:32:59,567 --> 00:33:01,000
She left and I went home.

423
00:33:01,327 --> 00:33:02,282
What time?

424
00:33:03,487 --> 00:33:04,681
About 7.

425
00:33:05,367 --> 00:33:06,163
And then?

426
00:33:07,367 --> 00:33:08,322
Then...

427
00:33:08,727 --> 00:33:10,285
- Then?
- Then...

428
00:33:10,487 --> 00:33:11,476
Then?

429
00:33:26,287 --> 00:33:26,766
I don't remember very well.

430
00:33:27,727 --> 00:33:30,195
You don't remember very well?

431
00:33:31,367 --> 00:33:33,085
No, I don't remember.

432
00:33:34,607 --> 00:33:36,245
You don't remember?

433
00:33:36,927 --> 00:33:38,086
But...

434
00:33:38,087 --> 00:33:39,759
You went back home,

435
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,126
after the station,

436
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:43,766
in 7 in the evening... And then?

437
00:33:45,047 --> 00:33:46,685
I can't remember...

438
00:33:47,127 --> 00:33:49,083
I've forgotten, I've...

439
00:33:49,287 --> 00:33:51,039
It's ridiculous!

440
00:33:51,247 --> 00:33:54,125
You don't remember what you
did just a few hours ago?

441
00:33:54,607 --> 00:33:55,960
You think that's normal?

442
00:33:57,567 --> 00:33:58,046
Is it a crime to forget?

443
00:33:59,487 --> 00:34:00,443
You are bullshitting me, Mr. Onoff!

444
00:34:01,487 --> 00:34:02,476
Bullshitting me!

445
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:04,126
Up my ass, Inspector!

446
00:34:04,407 --> 00:34:05,080
What do you think I
did? Why does it matter?

447
00:34:07,847 --> 00:34:09,838
- What do you care?
- OK, let's begin again.

448
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:11,116
From the top.

449
00:34:11,567 --> 00:34:13,205
This changes everything, Mr. Genius.

450
00:34:13,967 --> 00:34:15,878
I sincerely wanted to help you,

451
00:34:16,447 --> 00:34:18,597
I have the greatest
respect for what you do,

452
00:34:19,167 --> 00:34:20,441
for you work...

453
00:34:21,327 --> 00:34:22,203
But until

454
00:34:23,407 --> 00:34:24,318
you and your memory make contact,

455
00:34:24,527 --> 00:34:26,040
you are not leaving here.

456
00:34:26,247 --> 00:34:29,683
Help me? I don't need
help. What do you suspect

457
00:34:29,887 --> 00:34:31,605
in your hidebound
little hick-cop brain?

458
00:34:32,367 --> 00:34:33,243
Let's start.

459
00:34:33,887 --> 00:34:34,797
Name?

460
00:34:36,087 --> 00:34:37,076
What's your name?

461
00:34:38,887 --> 00:34:41,321
It's a simple question, dammit!

462
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:45,205
I won't answer until
I've made a phone call.

463
00:34:45,407 --> 00:34:47,682
You can't call and you won't call.

464
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:50,639
You can't call.

465
00:34:51,247 --> 00:34:53,681
I have the right to call my lawyer!

466
00:34:54,447 --> 00:34:57,120
I won't answer your stupid
questions without my lawyer!

467
00:35:02,007 --> 00:35:02,996
Look here...

468
00:35:03,887 --> 00:35:05,923
- I know your rights.
- No!

469
00:35:06,367 --> 00:35:08,756
You've refused me
everything from the start!

470
00:35:08,967 --> 00:35:10,720
First your guardian
angels: "Ask the Inspector,

471
00:35:12,927 --> 00:35:14,043
wait for the Inspector". Then you...

472
00:35:14,247 --> 00:35:16,886
"Give me the number, I'll
get it on my direct line".

473
00:35:17,087 --> 00:35:19,317
Why can't I call from
this jerkwater dump?

474
00:35:20,847 --> 00:35:22,565
The lines are out of order.

475
00:35:22,927 --> 00:35:24,155
Good enough?

476
00:35:24,447 --> 00:35:25,846
Well, Inspector,

477
00:35:26,047 --> 00:35:28,722
in all my career as a writer I never
indulged in such exuberant flights of fancy.

478
00:35:30,047 --> 00:35:31,002
Hats off!

479
00:35:31,207 --> 00:35:32,562
It's true, Mr. Onoff.
whenever there is a storm,

480
00:35:32,767 --> 00:35:35,486
the first thing to go is the phone.

481
00:35:36,247 --> 00:35:36,997
In fact,

482
00:35:37,607 --> 00:35:40,563
it's a wonder we still have power.

483
00:35:40,767 --> 00:35:41,837
- You should've said before.
- I give my word,

484
00:35:42,047 --> 00:35:44,641
once the lines are fixed,
you'll be the first to call.

485
00:35:46,847 --> 00:35:47,383
Go on. Your name?

486
00:35:47,384 --> 00:35:47,919
- Why?
- Why what?

487
00:35:48,127 --> 00:35:49,037
These questions.

488
00:35:49,487 --> 00:35:50,715
Please, your name.

489
00:35:51,407 --> 00:35:53,602
Why this interrogation, Inspector?

490
00:35:59,447 --> 00:36:03,042
Someone was murdered tonight
not far from your house.

491
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:08,241
Sit down.

492
00:36:09,927 --> 00:36:13,078
Congratulations, Inspector,
you've already got your killer.

493
00:36:13,287 --> 00:36:15,755
I don't think for a second
that you are a killer.

494
00:36:16,447 --> 00:36:18,836
But if you keep trying
me to make me believe

495
00:36:19,167 --> 00:36:21,204
that you don't remember a thing
you did after 7 in the evening,

496
00:36:22,407 --> 00:36:23,920
I’ll be forced to think you are.

497
00:36:25,047 --> 00:36:27,197
So, your name, if you please.

498
00:36:27,967 --> 00:36:28,922
My name is Onoff.

499
00:36:31,447 --> 00:36:32,596
Place and date of birth.

500
00:36:32,887 --> 00:36:35,560
February 3, 1946, in Vercere.

501
00:36:35,767 --> 00:36:37,200
- Profession.
- Writer.

502
00:36:37,407 --> 00:36:39,125
- Married?
- Twice married.

503
00:36:39,327 --> 00:36:40,362
Meaning...

504
00:36:40,767 --> 00:36:41,961
My first wife

505
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:44,317
died not long after our wedding.

506
00:36:45,407 --> 00:36:46,920
In what circumstances?

507
00:36:47,527 --> 00:36:48,437
Cancer.

508
00:36:49,927 --> 00:36:51,121
You remarried?

509
00:36:51,327 --> 00:36:52,840
I divorced nine years ago.

510
00:36:53,487 --> 00:36:54,203
Children?

511
00:36:54,447 --> 00:36:55,323
None.

512
00:36:55,527 --> 00:36:56,357
Prior offences?

513
00:36:56,567 --> 00:36:58,445
Like what? How many times
I ripped off a supermarket?

514
00:37:01,207 --> 00:37:03,118
How many people I killed before tonight?

515
00:37:04,087 --> 00:37:05,964
Denies any prior offences.

516
00:37:06,367 --> 00:37:07,243
What brought you

517
00:37:07,447 --> 00:37:08,641
to this wasteland?

518
00:37:08,847 --> 00:37:10,405
I've already told you twice.

519
00:37:11,087 --> 00:37:12,122
I came

520
00:37:12,327 --> 00:37:13,726
to my farmhouse

521
00:37:13,927 --> 00:37:14,882
to concentrate.

522
00:37:16,847 --> 00:37:17,757
Away from everything.

523
00:37:21,087 --> 00:37:22,759
Away from police inspectors.

524
00:37:23,807 --> 00:37:25,081
Were you alone?

525
00:37:25,727 --> 00:37:27,206
Just a second, sir.

526
00:37:27,407 --> 00:37:30,638
- Were you alone when you came to the house?
- No.

527
00:37:30,927 --> 00:37:31,837
Who was with you?

528
00:37:32,047 --> 00:37:33,275
My wife.

529
00:37:38,567 --> 00:37:40,683
You married a third time?

530
00:37:42,887 --> 00:37:44,320
No, I mean

531
00:37:44,527 --> 00:37:46,597
my second wife. My former
second wife, if you prefer.

532
00:37:46,807 --> 00:37:48,718
- You reconciled?

533
00:37:48,927 --> 00:37:51,122
No, no. We see each other regularly.

534
00:37:51,327 --> 00:37:54,478
You might say we've become
friends. Well... almost friends.

535
00:37:54,727 --> 00:37:57,195
How many bedrooms is
there in your farmhouse?

536
00:37:57,607 --> 00:38:00,804
When we are together we sleep
together if that's the question.

537
00:38:01,087 --> 00:38:04,477
So, when you woke at 3:30 in the
morning to contemplate the ceiling,

538
00:38:04,687 --> 00:38:05,676
you weren't alone?

539
00:38:10,167 --> 00:38:11,520
Obviously not.

540
00:38:11,927 --> 00:38:13,599
Why did you tell me you were?

541
00:38:13,807 --> 00:38:16,037
I didn't say that. Read the transcript.

542
00:38:16,367 --> 00:38:19,325
Not now! Before you said you woke up

543
00:38:20,087 --> 00:38:21,315
just before cock-crow

544
00:38:22,087 --> 00:38:23,122
and you were alone.

545
00:38:23,327 --> 00:38:24,680
I made a mistake!

546
00:38:25,327 --> 00:38:27,045
Anyway, we are always alone.

547
00:38:30,087 --> 00:38:31,805
How long have you been here?

548
00:38:32,807 --> 00:38:34,240
About nine days.

549
00:38:34,487 --> 00:38:35,886
How can you be sure?

550
00:38:36,087 --> 00:38:37,486
How can I be sure?

551
00:38:37,687 --> 00:38:39,598
If I say nine days, it's nine days!

552
00:38:39,807 --> 00:38:42,526
- Why did you tell me four?
- I didn't say four!

553
00:38:42,727 --> 00:38:44,080
You did, you said four days.

554
00:38:44,607 --> 00:38:45,756
So, I counted wrong.

555
00:38:46,687 --> 00:38:49,759
I loose all track of time
when I work Besides...

556
00:38:50,367 --> 00:38:52,676
That's why we work:
to lose consciousness.

557
00:38:55,607 --> 00:38:58,246
Listen to me, Mr. Onoff.

558
00:38:58,807 --> 00:39:01,844
If you contradict yourself
in your novels or your poems,

559
00:39:02,047 --> 00:39:02,923
that's fine.

560
00:39:03,127 --> 00:39:06,756
But if you keep contradicting
yourself in a murder investigation,

561
00:39:07,127 --> 00:39:07,843
then that's...

562
00:39:13,167 --> 00:39:15,044
Any more and we'll all drawn!

563
00:39:15,647 --> 00:39:16,523
Shit.

564
00:39:17,767 --> 00:39:20,076
We'll take care of it, Mr. Inspector.

565
00:39:21,327 --> 00:39:23,966
How can you live in a place like that?

566
00:39:25,287 --> 00:39:27,642
How can we live in a place like this!

567
00:39:28,647 --> 00:39:31,207
How can we live in a place like this!

568
00:39:32,767 --> 00:39:34,803
We are ready, Mr. Inspector.

569
00:40:04,247 --> 00:40:05,236
Excuse me!

570
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:09,846
Yes?

571
00:40:09,847 --> 00:40:11,439
A while back, I noticed...

572
00:40:12,167 --> 00:40:14,158
Bottles. I think it was wine.

573
00:40:14,367 --> 00:40:15,766
Could I have some?

574
00:40:21,727 --> 00:40:22,876
It's a good wine.

575
00:40:29,367 --> 00:40:30,766
Best in the region.

576
00:40:37,327 --> 00:40:39,124
- Here.
- Thanks.

577
00:40:39,887 --> 00:40:40,797
Thanks.

578
00:40:44,967 --> 00:40:46,923
- Good, eh?
- I'll say!

579
00:40:47,527 --> 00:40:48,960
Have some more.

580
00:40:49,527 --> 00:40:50,755
To bring you luck.

581
00:40:50,967 --> 00:40:54,801
It's February 3rd. You birthday, right?

582
00:40:57,607 --> 00:40:58,722
So it is.

583
00:40:59,927 --> 00:41:01,076
Yes, indeed.

584
00:41:05,327 --> 00:41:06,919
Can I ask you a question?

585
00:41:07,487 --> 00:41:08,681
What else do you do here?

586
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:13,919
When I whistled that tune
before, you got mad, remember?

587
00:41:14,207 --> 00:41:15,845
It wasn't you I was mad at.

588
00:41:16,327 --> 00:41:17,999
I am sorry. I apologize.

589
00:41:18,727 --> 00:41:20,285
Let's give them a hand.

590
00:41:36,007 --> 00:41:39,124
No, it's because... I know
I whistle off key but...

591
00:41:39,327 --> 00:41:41,558
- You recognized the tune?
- I recognized it.

592
00:41:48,687 --> 00:41:51,565
I guess everyone in the
world had told you that.

593
00:41:53,527 --> 00:41:55,961
But... To me that song
is a big part of my life.

594
00:42:36,047 --> 00:42:37,958
Here we go! What'd I tell you!

595
00:42:38,167 --> 00:42:39,236
Come sit down please.

596
00:42:51,727 --> 00:42:54,400
Andre, I don't know
where the candles are.

597
00:42:55,407 --> 00:42:57,125
Look around, they are over there!

598
00:42:57,767 --> 00:42:58,722
Hurry up!

599
00:43:07,967 --> 00:43:11,482
Mister! Mister! I'll pour you
some more wine. Where's your glass?

600
00:44:23,807 --> 00:44:27,320
Andre, open up! What's going
on? Break down the door!

601
00:46:14,007 --> 00:46:15,838
- Your name?
- Onoff.

602
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,679
Date and place of birth.

603
00:46:19,487 --> 00:46:22,160
February 3, in Vercere.
Saint Blaise's day.

604
00:46:23,527 --> 00:46:25,995
- Year?
- 1946.

605
00:46:26,807 --> 00:46:28,763
- Profession?
- Writer.

606
00:46:29,047 --> 00:46:30,719
- Married?
- Twice.

607
00:46:31,527 --> 00:46:33,040
- Children?
- None.

608
00:46:33,687 --> 00:46:37,077
How many days ago did you
come to your country house?

609
00:46:37,847 --> 00:46:38,882
Four.

610
00:46:40,407 --> 00:46:43,080
First you said four, then nine.

611
00:46:43,327 --> 00:46:44,919
Now it is four again?

612
00:46:45,407 --> 00:46:46,362
Four.

613
00:46:48,087 --> 00:46:49,520
Who did you come with?

614
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:53,444
My ex-second wife.

615
00:46:55,087 --> 00:46:58,159
- What's your ex-second
wife name? - Danielle.

616
00:47:00,807 --> 00:47:02,365
Danielle February.

617
00:47:02,807 --> 00:47:04,240
Isn't that your agent?

618
00:47:04,927 --> 00:47:05,996
The same thing.

619
00:47:06,807 --> 00:47:08,081
What does that mean?

620
00:47:09,047 --> 00:47:12,164
It means my ex-second wife is my agent.

621
00:47:14,567 --> 00:47:17,081
So she is the one you
took to the train station?

622
00:47:18,287 --> 00:47:19,003
Yes.

623
00:47:20,567 --> 00:47:21,682
What time?

624
00:47:22,127 --> 00:47:23,560
Before dusk.

625
00:47:25,567 --> 00:47:27,205
What did you do then?

626
00:47:27,567 --> 00:47:29,125
I stayed home.

627
00:47:29,927 --> 00:47:32,805
You stayed home? Or you went home?

628
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:36,486
I stayed home all day long.

629
00:47:38,727 --> 00:47:39,955
All day long...

630
00:47:42,247 --> 00:47:43,680
Can I have some wine?

631
00:47:49,607 --> 00:47:50,960
If you didn't leave home

632
00:47:51,167 --> 00:47:52,486
all day long,

633
00:47:52,767 --> 00:47:55,645
how could you take

634
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:58,163
Danielle February to the station?

635
00:47:58,527 --> 00:47:59,846
I didn't take her.

636
00:48:00,527 --> 00:48:02,040
She went by herself.

637
00:48:02,607 --> 00:48:05,201
After she left, who came to see you?

638
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,842
Nobody.

639
00:48:07,887 --> 00:48:09,115
Are you sure?

640
00:48:09,687 --> 00:48:10,836
I am sure.

641
00:48:12,527 --> 00:48:14,438
I didn't go out all evening.

642
00:48:15,127 --> 00:48:16,765
Please believe me.

643
00:48:20,687 --> 00:48:23,804
What did you do after
your ex-second wife left?

644
00:49:04,607 --> 00:49:07,724
Answer. What did you do?

645
00:49:08,767 --> 00:49:11,076
I don't remember what I did next.

646
00:49:12,047 --> 00:49:14,515
But you say you didn't go out all day.

647
00:49:14,727 --> 00:49:15,603
Yes.

648
00:49:16,767 --> 00:49:19,282
How do you know, if you
don't remember what you did?

649
00:49:21,007 --> 00:49:22,804
Don't remember...

650
00:49:24,167 --> 00:49:27,603
Could we say you didn't go out
during the time you remember?

651
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,523
Yes.

652
00:49:28,887 --> 00:49:32,516
So it's possible you
went out... afterward.

653
00:49:34,567 --> 00:49:36,398
I don't remember.

654
00:49:38,087 --> 00:49:40,078
I no longer ask you to remember.

655
00:49:41,207 --> 00:49:44,597
Merely to admit you've
been talking a load of crap!

656
00:49:46,327 --> 00:49:48,682
First you claimed you came here alone,

657
00:49:48,887 --> 00:49:52,357
your agent came to visit, and
you took her to the station.

658
00:49:52,567 --> 00:49:54,398
Somewhere between 5 and 5:30.

659
00:49:55,167 --> 00:49:57,397
Then thinking it over, you came

660
00:49:57,607 --> 00:50:00,485
with your wife. Your ex-wife.

661
00:50:01,167 --> 00:50:04,443
Your ex-second wife,
who's also your agent.

662
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:06,758
Only you didn't take her to
the station, she took herself

663
00:50:06,967 --> 00:50:08,197
to the station.

664
00:50:09,207 --> 00:50:10,322
Mr. Onoff...

665
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,195
At that station...

666
00:50:15,047 --> 00:50:17,925
At that station, not so
much as one lousy train

667
00:50:18,167 --> 00:50:20,556
has stopped for one lousy minute

668
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:22,883
since you came to your farmhouse.

669
00:50:24,247 --> 00:50:26,715
For the simple reason that
there's never been a station here!

670
00:50:29,167 --> 00:50:30,202
Never!

671
00:50:38,847 --> 00:50:41,805
You are not worthy of
the books you've written.

672
00:50:42,927 --> 00:50:45,521
Your novels, your poems, your plays,

673
00:50:46,047 --> 00:50:48,515
your songs are a better
bargain then you are.

674
00:50:48,727 --> 00:50:49,876
I hope so.

675
00:50:53,087 --> 00:50:54,645
Now let's say the truth.

676
00:50:55,807 --> 00:50:56,842
Confess!

677
00:50:57,687 --> 00:51:00,804
You are making the biggest
mistake of your career,

678
00:51:01,007 --> 00:51:03,077
which I would guess is
not particularly brilliant.

679
00:51:03,607 --> 00:51:06,997
Then why did you try
to run off like a thief?

680
00:51:07,207 --> 00:51:09,437
Why don't you prove your innocence?

681
00:51:09,647 --> 00:51:11,956
Why not put an end to my suspicions?

682
00:51:12,727 --> 00:51:14,160
I'll tell you why.

683
00:51:16,727 --> 00:51:19,116
Because tonight you committed murder.

684
00:51:19,407 --> 00:51:21,079
I don't know if anyone was murdered.

685
00:51:21,287 --> 00:51:23,926
If someone was murdered,
I don't know where.

686
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:27,717
If somewhere someone actually
was murdered, I don't know who.

687
00:51:27,927 --> 00:51:31,363
A little old lady, a
child, a goat, a scarecrow!

688
00:51:33,327 --> 00:51:35,557
You don't know a thing, yet it's you

689
00:51:35,767 --> 00:51:37,200
who'll tell us who the victim is.

690
00:51:37,407 --> 00:51:40,479
You accuse me of murder and
I'm supposed to name the victim?

691
00:51:40,687 --> 00:51:43,201
You are supposed to tell me who it is!

692
00:51:43,447 --> 00:51:46,120
What kind of cop are you? A retard,

693
00:51:46,327 --> 00:51:47,282
a madman?

694
00:51:48,807 --> 00:51:51,037
I was never an ace detective

695
00:51:51,247 --> 00:51:52,839
and maybe I never will be.

696
00:51:53,327 --> 00:51:56,478
But during my not
particularly brilliant career

697
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:58,997
I've handled a lot of homicides.

698
00:51:59,567 --> 00:52:02,161
Some I never solved. In others

699
00:52:02,367 --> 00:52:05,677
I made some fancy deductions
which turned out to be all wrong.

700
00:52:08,407 --> 00:52:10,796
Once in a while I was lucky enough

701
00:52:11,007 --> 00:52:13,680
to stumble on the
right trail and discover

702
00:52:13,887 --> 00:52:16,196
a few little keys which worked

703
00:52:16,407 --> 00:52:17,760
very nicely in a few little locks.

704
00:52:18,407 --> 00:52:22,241
Very rarely I broke the case
using my own intelligence.

705
00:52:23,207 --> 00:52:26,244
But this is the first
homicide I've dealt with

706
00:52:26,607 --> 00:52:29,360
where the only mystery left to solve

707
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:31,558
is the identity of the corpse.

708
00:52:31,927 --> 00:52:34,361
Unfortunately, I can't do it.

709
00:52:34,887 --> 00:52:38,118
The victim's face is horribly mutilated

710
00:52:38,607 --> 00:52:42,202
and we can't start identification
proceedings until tomorrow.

711
00:52:44,447 --> 00:52:45,960
Know what I think?

712
00:52:47,967 --> 00:52:48,763
No.

713
00:52:49,447 --> 00:52:51,403
I think you are the murderer.

714
00:52:52,967 --> 00:52:54,639
You killed the guy,

715
00:52:54,847 --> 00:52:57,281
and the ideal scapegoat came
along just at the right time!

716
00:52:59,447 --> 00:53:01,358
How do you know it's a man?

717
00:53:01,967 --> 00:53:04,401
- What man?
- You said: "Know what I think?

718
00:53:04,607 --> 00:53:06,996
You are the murderer.
You killed the guy."

719
00:53:07,327 --> 00:53:08,521
You're twisting my words!

720
00:53:10,007 --> 00:53:12,567
But you do know it's a man!

721
00:53:12,807 --> 00:53:15,640
I don't know anything! You
are trying to confuse me.

722
00:53:16,167 --> 00:53:18,965
You know very well whether
it's a man or a woman.

723
00:53:19,527 --> 00:53:22,041
Either way, you have
no evidence against me.

724
00:53:22,247 --> 00:53:25,159
A trivial lapse of memory
doesn't prove a thing.

725
00:53:25,367 --> 00:53:26,880
"Trivial lapse of memory"...

726
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:41,599
"So as not to die of
anguish or of shame,

727
00:53:42,247 --> 00:53:44,807
men are eternally condemned to forget

728
00:53:45,007 --> 00:53:47,043
the unpleasant moments of their lives.

729
00:53:47,327 --> 00:53:50,478
And the more unpleasant they are,
the faster they are forgotten."

730
00:53:50,767 --> 00:53:51,597
This...

731
00:53:54,687 --> 00:53:57,121
That's by you, my dear Onoff.

732
00:53:58,447 --> 00:54:01,166
The man who has written this

733
00:54:01,367 --> 00:54:03,676
must have done something
very unpleasant indeed

734
00:54:03,887 --> 00:54:07,197
to make him forget this
actions of just a few hours ago.

735
00:54:07,407 --> 00:54:10,638
If writers knew whose mouths
end up spewing out their works,

736
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:12,200
they'd cut off their hands.

737
00:54:12,487 --> 00:54:14,045
And it would be a pity.

738
00:54:15,167 --> 00:54:16,282
You believe in God?

739
00:54:17,047 --> 00:54:18,878
After all, He is the Great Writer.

740
00:54:19,607 --> 00:54:22,804
If He'd had to allow for the morons
who'd later lay claim to His works,

741
00:54:23,807 --> 00:54:25,638
to give up too many plans.

742
00:54:25,847 --> 00:54:27,758
It's not hard to believe in God.

743
00:54:29,007 --> 00:54:30,679
I believed in Him many times.

744
00:54:30,887 --> 00:54:33,606
But I must say I was
often ashamed for Him.

745
00:54:34,367 --> 00:54:37,404
He would've been an
excellent writer, if only

746
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:38,926
He'd stuck to describing scenery.

747
00:54:39,407 --> 00:54:40,920
Excuse me, Mr. Inspector.

748
00:54:41,807 --> 00:54:43,081
I didn't quite get that.

749
00:54:43,327 --> 00:54:46,956
Mr. Onoff, here present, claims God is a second
- rate writer.

750
00:54:53,127 --> 00:54:55,766
Why do you get so annoyed
when I quote your books?

751
00:54:57,047 --> 00:55:00,596
My job is to write. Hearing about
my works doesn't interest me.

752
00:55:02,367 --> 00:55:05,165
Language no longer has any
purpose in today's world.

753
00:55:06,167 --> 00:55:08,806
It's only good for
police interrogations.

754
00:55:10,687 --> 00:55:13,520
I see why you haven't
published in six years.

755
00:55:15,127 --> 00:55:17,925
I thought it was another
of your creative breakdowns.

756
00:55:18,847 --> 00:55:20,166
What are you talking about?

757
00:55:20,487 --> 00:55:24,446
Three years of silence preceding
"The Palace of Nine Frontiers".

758
00:55:25,127 --> 00:55:26,640
It's a long time ago, but...

759
00:55:27,447 --> 00:55:29,836
I recall the press
went on about breakdown.

760
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,399
Breakdown,

761
00:55:32,087 --> 00:55:35,159
an endless terror of
the blank page, right?

762
00:55:37,287 --> 00:55:38,163
Bravo!

763
00:55:39,647 --> 00:55:41,842
You know more about me than

764
00:55:42,327 --> 00:55:43,555
I remember

765
00:55:43,767 --> 00:55:44,677
myself.

766
00:55:45,047 --> 00:55:46,685
That's for sure!

767
00:55:48,047 --> 00:55:48,923
Disappointed?

768
00:55:50,127 --> 00:55:51,446
Frankly, yes.

769
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:55,367
We should never come face
to face with our own idols.

770
00:55:57,287 --> 00:55:59,517
Seen close up, they
turn out to have pimples.

771
00:56:00,207 --> 00:56:03,597
We may find out that the great
works which inspired our dreams

772
00:56:03,807 --> 00:56:06,480
were thought up while
sitting on the john,

773
00:56:07,927 --> 00:56:09,042
during a bout of diarrhea!

774
00:56:11,287 --> 00:56:13,278
Aside from me, do you have many enemies?

775
00:56:14,327 --> 00:56:15,316
Oh, yes!

776
00:56:16,327 --> 00:56:20,081
One made a face at me just today and
I don't know why, but I killed him.

777
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:24,165
Have you ever owned a gun?

778
00:56:25,847 --> 00:56:26,723
No.

779
00:56:26,927 --> 00:56:27,882
Sure?

780
00:56:28,287 --> 00:56:30,437
I've never owned a weapon of any kind.

781
00:56:30,687 --> 00:56:33,155
I don't know how to
shoot, I've never shot.

782
00:56:34,527 --> 00:56:37,166
You are going in circles,
Inspector. You'd better to question

783
00:56:37,367 --> 00:56:39,005
the body you hid down below.

784
00:56:40,047 --> 00:56:41,958
What makes you think it's a body?

785
00:56:42,487 --> 00:56:45,047
I saw it myself when you
took it out of the van.

786
00:56:46,007 --> 00:56:48,043
Look, all you can accuse me of

787
00:56:48,247 --> 00:56:50,203
is manhandling a couple of cops.

788
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:53,638
The rest is hocus-pocus!
You have no solid evidence!

789
00:56:53,847 --> 00:56:55,883
No grounds to hold me for murder!

790
00:56:56,087 --> 00:56:58,203
You don't even know the victim's name!

791
00:56:58,527 --> 00:57:01,041
Tomorrow I have a meeting
with the Minister of Culture!

792
00:57:01,247 --> 00:57:03,283
You'd better release me, or else...

793
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:05,478
You're about to commit another crime!

794
00:57:13,927 --> 00:57:15,485
I advise you to keep quiet.

795
00:57:18,607 --> 00:57:19,403
Sit.

796
00:57:29,007 --> 00:57:31,726
I'll take your advise and keep quiet.

797
00:57:48,447 --> 00:57:49,357
My dear Onoff,

798
00:57:49,767 --> 00:57:50,836
I don't rule out

799
00:57:51,047 --> 00:57:53,925
the possibility that I'll
fail to prove your guilt.

800
00:57:54,567 --> 00:57:55,400
No.

801
00:57:55,767 --> 00:57:57,758
In a way, I hope that's the case.

802
00:57:58,447 --> 00:58:00,005
But you won't have any meeting

803
00:58:00,207 --> 00:58:01,720
with any Minister.

804
00:58:03,007 --> 00:58:06,238
You won't have any
meeting with any Minister,

805
00:58:07,247 --> 00:58:08,760
till you tell me what you did

806
00:58:08,967 --> 00:58:10,036
after dusk.

807
00:58:10,247 --> 00:58:11,999
Even at the risk of hearing

808
00:58:12,207 --> 00:58:13,435
you spent the whole time

809
00:58:13,647 --> 00:58:16,719
parked on the john with a
monumental bout of diarrhea!

810
00:58:19,967 --> 00:58:22,162
D'you want me to move
the desk, Mr. Inspector?

811
00:58:24,007 --> 00:58:25,599
It'll keep us awake.

812
00:58:26,807 --> 00:58:28,559
We're in for a long night.

813
00:58:28,967 --> 00:58:30,320
Right, get on with it.

814
00:58:30,847 --> 00:58:33,281
Does your ex-second wife remarry?

815
00:58:35,487 --> 00:58:36,966
Does she live with someone?

816
00:58:38,487 --> 00:58:39,602
Does she have a lover?

817
00:58:41,847 --> 00:58:44,441
I'll take your advise and keep quiet.

818
00:58:50,967 --> 00:58:54,277
Improbable as it seems,
let's suppose neither you

819
00:58:54,487 --> 00:58:56,239
nor your ex-second wife

820
00:58:56,447 --> 00:58:57,766
knew the area.

821
00:58:58,407 --> 00:59:00,967
So she didn't go to the "station",

822
00:59:01,167 --> 00:59:03,283
but went to "look for a station".

823
00:59:03,567 --> 00:59:06,639
To look for a station
nearby, in order to leave.

824
00:59:11,207 --> 00:59:12,560
But in this case

825
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:14,166
how would you get the car back?

826
00:59:14,927 --> 00:59:17,077
I'll take your advise

827
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:18,515
and keep quiet.

828
00:59:20,487 --> 00:59:21,317
Maybe...

829
00:59:21,527 --> 00:59:24,519
She went to look for a
station with someone else.

830
00:59:25,247 --> 00:59:28,284
Someone who afterward
went back to your place.

831
00:59:29,087 --> 00:59:29,803
Who?

832
00:59:33,287 --> 00:59:35,403
I'll take your advise and keep quiet.

833
00:59:37,367 --> 00:59:39,562
Or simpler still, she never left.

834
00:59:40,167 --> 00:59:42,761
Maybe she stayed with
you to keep your company?

835
00:59:44,527 --> 00:59:45,755
But in this case,

836
00:59:46,287 --> 00:59:49,563
where was she when my men arrested you?

837
00:59:50,607 --> 00:59:53,838
Why were you running so out
of breath you couldn't talk?

838
00:59:54,247 --> 00:59:56,283
I'll take your advise and keep quiet.

839
00:59:57,767 --> 01:00:01,203
93633396,

840
01:00:03,407 --> 01:00:04,398
is that your ex-second wife's number?

841
01:00:04,727 --> 01:00:07,116
I'll take your advise and keep quiet.

842
01:00:08,207 --> 01:00:10,846
You expressly asked to call that number!

843
01:00:11,207 --> 01:00:14,722
Then you implied the victim
could be a man! To cover your ass.

844
01:00:15,327 --> 01:00:18,046
To throw us off course.
Is the victim the woman

845
01:00:18,247 --> 01:00:20,522
whose number is 93633396?

846
01:00:24,767 --> 01:00:26,041
If it's not her,

847
01:00:26,407 --> 01:00:29,285
how many potential
victims does a man have,

848
01:00:29,687 --> 01:00:33,441
a man of renown, a recluse, whom
no one has seen for several years?

849
01:00:33,887 --> 01:00:37,163
How many know you well enough
to know where to find you,

850
01:00:37,727 --> 01:00:41,640
here, in the middle of nowhere,
where even you say you seldom come?

851
01:00:42,167 --> 01:00:43,646
The list can't be enormous.

852
01:00:44,647 --> 01:00:45,557
A friend?

853
01:00:47,367 --> 01:00:48,595
A mistress?

854
01:00:50,887 --> 01:00:51,876
A relative?

855
01:00:53,287 --> 01:00:54,879
The chauffeur? The secretary?

856
01:00:56,887 --> 01:00:59,203
Your doctor? Your lawyer?

857
01:00:59,204 --> 01:01:01,520
One of your collaborators?

858
01:01:02,767 --> 01:01:03,995
A journalist?

859
01:01:06,247 --> 01:01:08,158
A photographer, chasing a scoop?

860
01:01:08,367 --> 01:01:12,406
A student who's pestered you for
years with a series of inane questions?

861
01:01:13,967 --> 01:01:15,036
Your editor?

862
01:01:17,887 --> 01:01:21,004
Which one came to see
you yesterday afternoon?

863
01:01:31,487 --> 01:01:33,876
I'll take your advise and keep quiet.

864
01:01:34,287 --> 01:01:36,005
You come from a military family.

865
01:01:36,287 --> 01:01:38,517
Your father was a hero in the war.

866
01:01:38,847 --> 01:01:40,405
You yourself were an officer.

867
01:01:40,406 --> 01:01:42,276
And I'm to believe

868
01:01:42,487 --> 01:01:44,079
you've never held a gun?

869
01:01:45,687 --> 01:01:47,962
Go on, take my advice and keep quiet!

870
01:02:22,727 --> 01:02:24,445
That's enough, Onoff!

871
01:03:23,727 --> 01:03:25,080
Stop it, stop it.

872
01:03:36,927 --> 01:03:38,883
We've changed the tune, Onoff.

873
01:03:40,007 --> 01:03:41,520
Nobody plays games with me.

874
01:04:14,647 --> 01:04:18,196
As your biography is
world-famous, I know it by heart.

875
01:04:25,407 --> 01:04:26,282
He was born in a ditch,

876
01:04:26,347 --> 01:04:27,566
at the edge of a field.

877
01:04:28,407 --> 01:04:32,116
She who borne him severed
the cord with her teeth,

878
01:04:32,567 --> 01:04:33,556
tied it off

879
01:04:34,167 --> 01:04:35,361
and left.

880
01:04:36,847 --> 01:04:39,315
They baptized him Blaise February,

881
01:04:40,567 --> 01:04:44,276
because he was found on a
freezing night in February,

882
01:04:46,487 --> 01:04:48,205
and because it was the feast day

883
01:04:48,807 --> 01:04:50,399
of Saint Blaise.

884
01:04:55,047 --> 01:04:57,038
I am Blaise February!

885
01:05:00,247 --> 01:05:02,124
My biography is a lie,

886
01:05:02,847 --> 01:05:05,486
from beginning to
end. I wrote it myself.

887
01:05:08,567 --> 01:05:12,037
An old man made up a new name
for me, worthy of a writer.

888
01:05:13,087 --> 01:05:14,725
The name Onoff.

889
01:05:17,287 --> 01:05:18,959
He was called Faubin.

890
01:05:20,327 --> 01:05:21,999
He was my best friend.

891
01:05:23,447 --> 01:05:26,120
It's thanks to him that I became great.

892
01:05:29,447 --> 01:05:32,007
I was never in the army,

893
01:05:32,527 --> 01:05:34,085
never fired a gun.

894
01:05:37,847 --> 01:05:39,121
I grew up

895
01:05:46,407 --> 01:05:48,125
in an orphanage.

896
01:05:51,567 --> 01:05:53,319
They gave us milk...

897
01:05:53,687 --> 01:05:57,521
every day warm milk,
morning and evening.

898
01:06:00,167 --> 01:06:02,920
I detest warm milk.

899
01:06:20,007 --> 01:06:22,919
Paula, get me a cup of coffee,

900
01:06:23,887 --> 01:06:25,115
would you?

901
01:06:26,407 --> 01:06:28,045
I've had a nightmare...

902
01:06:28,647 --> 01:06:31,002
a terrifying nightmare.

903
01:06:32,567 --> 01:06:34,558
I dreamt I killed my editor,

904
01:06:36,167 --> 01:06:38,158
and took back my manuscript.

905
01:06:38,367 --> 01:06:40,483
I ran and ran and ran to your place.

906
01:06:41,367 --> 01:06:43,358
But your house had turned into

907
01:06:43,607 --> 01:06:44,960
a police station

908
01:06:45,687 --> 01:06:48,440
with a strange inspector...

909
01:06:49,807 --> 01:06:52,082
He recited all my books by heart.

910
01:06:53,727 --> 01:06:56,366
Paula, get me some paper,

911
01:06:56,567 --> 01:06:58,000
I have to write all this down.

912
01:07:00,007 --> 01:07:01,076
Paula...

913
01:07:51,887 --> 01:07:54,162
It's a mess...

914
01:07:54,367 --> 01:07:55,925
I've never seen the inspector like this.

915
01:07:56,127 --> 01:07:59,403
If you ask me, he's stumped. It's a
funny situation. Proof, he needs proof.

916
01:07:59,607 --> 01:08:02,360
- The captain says not.
- That asshole.

917
01:08:02,567 --> 01:08:04,080
Ignore him. He's basically OK.

918
01:08:04,287 --> 01:08:05,720
They're all nice here...

919
01:08:05,927 --> 01:08:09,397
I still have to get used to it,
I need time. I never thought...

920
01:08:19,807 --> 01:08:21,160
What time is it?

921
01:08:21,807 --> 01:08:23,320
3:30 in the morning.

922
01:08:23,527 --> 01:08:25,040
You slept an hour.

923
01:08:25,967 --> 01:08:28,162
Cold; want to warm yourself?

924
01:08:30,087 --> 01:08:32,601
Can I have some paper? I
want to make some notes.

925
01:08:37,207 --> 01:08:38,162
Well... sure.

926
01:08:40,327 --> 01:08:42,919
Give him some hot wine.

927
01:08:49,007 --> 01:08:51,840
- An idea for a new book?
- You don't write because you have an idea,

928
01:08:53,047 --> 01:08:55,481
but because you can't do anything else.

929
01:09:26,847 --> 01:09:27,757
Shit!

930
01:09:36,247 --> 01:09:37,257
Shit!

931
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:40,200
- Really, that...
- Shut up.

932
01:09:42,927 --> 01:09:43,916
Just shut up.

933
01:10:09,927 --> 01:10:12,680
When I tell people this,
nobody'll believe me.

934
01:10:13,647 --> 01:10:16,161
How can a place as absurd
as this possibly exist?

935
01:10:16,367 --> 01:10:18,437
True.

936
01:10:18,647 --> 01:10:21,002
It's no place for a
world traveler like you.

937
01:10:21,967 --> 01:10:23,525
We don't have anything.

938
01:10:24,047 --> 01:10:25,082
It's not a big city.

939
01:10:25,447 --> 01:10:26,562
Nothing here but the forest.

940
01:10:27,847 --> 01:10:29,042
I've had my job here for fifteen years.

941
01:10:29,447 --> 01:10:30,806
I've always liked it fine.

942
01:10:30,807 --> 01:10:34,002
Wouldn't catch me in
a city, not even dead.

943
01:10:40,967 --> 01:10:43,197
The typewriter. Could I

944
01:10:43,407 --> 01:10:44,681
use the typewriter?

945
01:10:45,367 --> 01:10:47,562
It's logical, it's logical, but...

946
01:10:47,767 --> 01:10:50,361
- Yes, come on.
- ...but you have to ask the Inspector.

947
01:10:50,607 --> 01:10:51,562
No...

948
01:11:14,007 --> 01:11:15,804
Is it possible to kill

949
01:11:18,367 --> 01:11:20,959
and not remember?

950
01:11:45,967 --> 01:11:48,276
Remember, to remember...

951
01:11:48,687 --> 01:11:51,155
It's so easy to look back,
old memories trapped in amber,

952
01:11:51,367 --> 01:11:53,722
pain and sorrow tingled with black,

953
01:11:53,967 --> 01:11:56,435
everything in amber,
everything in amber.

954
01:11:56,647 --> 01:11:59,207
We must learn how to forget,

955
01:11:59,407 --> 01:12:01,967
A much harder thing to do,

956
01:12:02,167 --> 01:12:04,522
we must go on without regret,

957
01:12:04,727 --> 01:12:07,036
Wipe clean the slate

958
01:12:17,927 --> 01:12:20,441
and start anew.

959
01:12:20,687 --> 01:12:23,281
Erase the past and look ahead...

960
01:12:28,867 --> 01:12:31,939
Ever seen this man, Mr. February?

961
01:12:56,387 --> 01:12:58,264
Seems to me I know him.

962
01:12:58,467 --> 01:12:59,502
Who is he?

963
01:13:03,747 --> 01:13:06,466
My math teacher, when
I was in high school.

964
01:13:07,627 --> 01:13:08,616
What else?

965
01:13:09,547 --> 01:13:12,141
It's to him I owe my passion to numbers,

966
01:13:12,387 --> 01:13:13,615
for symmetry,

967
01:13:14,347 --> 01:13:16,178
geometric reasoning.

968
01:13:18,667 --> 01:13:20,658
Professor Trivarchi...

969
01:13:21,987 --> 01:13:24,455
He set forth theorems
as if they were fables.

970
01:13:25,187 --> 01:13:27,143
His words didn't go through our ears,

971
01:13:27,427 --> 01:13:29,895
they went directly to our minds.

972
01:13:32,467 --> 01:13:34,901
His lessons were sincere and pleasant.

973
01:13:38,987 --> 01:13:42,218
"Two parallel lines can never meet.

974
01:13:44,387 --> 01:13:45,297
Nonetheless,

975
01:13:46,427 --> 01:13:49,737
it is possible to imagine
the existence of a point

976
01:13:50,107 --> 01:13:52,257
so far out of space,

977
01:13:52,627 --> 01:13:53,582
so far

978
01:13:53,787 --> 01:13:57,097
into infinity,

979
01:13:57,347 --> 01:13:59,178
that we can admit

980
01:13:59,747 --> 01:14:00,463
and acknowledge, that our two lines

981
01:14:00,667 --> 01:14:02,419
do in fact meet there.

982
01:14:03,267 --> 01:14:04,222
So it is.

983
01:14:05,987 --> 01:14:07,898
We shall call this point

984
01:14:09,507 --> 01:14:10,337
the ideal

985
01:14:11,107 --> 01:14:12,142
point".

986
01:14:23,547 --> 01:14:26,345
- Never saw her before.
- Are you sure?

987
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:46,983
Well?

988
01:14:48,387 --> 01:14:49,456
Yes...

989
01:14:51,027 --> 01:14:52,460
Yes, I know her.

990
01:14:52,787 --> 01:14:53,697
And..?

991
01:14:56,387 --> 01:14:58,537
She's a girl I once loved.

992
01:15:00,307 --> 01:15:03,140
Can you tell me when you saw her last?

993
01:15:03,947 --> 01:15:06,620
One morning I left her
sleeping at the hotel.

994
01:15:07,867 --> 01:15:09,539
I went to the airport.

995
01:15:10,787 --> 01:15:12,618
I didn't even say goodbye.

996
01:15:13,987 --> 01:15:15,340
That was twenty years ago.

997
01:15:18,507 --> 01:15:20,543
Where did you find these pictures?

998
01:15:23,187 --> 01:15:25,098
Figure it out for yourself!

999
01:15:25,747 --> 01:15:27,738
I've been looking for
them for so long...

1000
01:15:29,227 --> 01:15:31,297
Were you looking last night, too?

1001
01:15:42,027 --> 01:15:42,459
Yes...

1002
01:15:42,987 --> 01:15:44,705
Last night, too.

1003
01:15:46,947 --> 01:15:49,381
I've been looking high
and low for ages and ages,

1004
01:15:49,707 --> 01:15:51,026
and never found them.

1005
01:15:51,947 --> 01:15:53,585
Not just these two.

1006
01:15:54,267 --> 01:15:55,859
There were a whole lot of them...

1007
01:15:58,307 --> 01:15:59,786
A mountain of pictures.

1008
01:15:59,987 --> 01:16:02,455
Why are they so important?

1009
01:16:03,227 --> 01:16:04,546
I don't know.

1010
01:16:05,187 --> 01:16:07,337
They are relics of a
strange habit of mine,

1011
01:16:07,547 --> 01:16:10,186
or, if you prefer, a vice I
practiced almost all my life.

1012
01:16:11,347 --> 01:16:13,577
I always used to carry a small camera.

1013
01:16:13,787 --> 01:16:16,426
I collected the faces of
everyone I met, everywhere I went.

1014
01:16:16,867 --> 01:16:18,427
Sort of an unorthodox way

1015
01:16:18,627 --> 01:16:21,026
of keeping a diary.

1016
01:16:23,067 --> 01:16:26,537
A game I gave up, the
very day I made up my mind

1017
01:16:27,107 --> 01:16:29,143
to retire from public life.

1018
01:16:31,867 --> 01:16:32,697
After that

1019
01:16:35,787 --> 01:16:37,379
I mislaid them.

1020
01:16:41,907 --> 01:16:44,580
All my friends and all my
enemies are in those pictures.

1021
01:16:45,547 --> 01:16:47,583
The people I love and used to love,

1022
01:16:48,627 --> 01:16:51,699
those I didn't know how
to or didn't want to love.

1023
01:16:55,987 --> 01:16:58,376
Those who shook my hand and smiled,

1024
01:17:02,107 --> 01:17:03,256
and those

1025
01:17:03,667 --> 01:17:05,066
who looked at me

1026
01:17:07,187 --> 01:17:08,256
just looked

1027
01:17:08,947 --> 01:17:10,266
without saying anything.

1028
01:17:10,627 --> 01:17:11,946
Thousands and thousands

1029
01:17:12,147 --> 01:17:13,705
and thousands of faces.

1030
01:17:15,387 --> 01:17:16,979
Where did you get them?

1031
01:17:17,427 --> 01:17:20,305
We simply searched your farmhouse.

1032
01:17:25,987 --> 01:17:28,057
You obviously didn't look very heartily.

1033
01:18:06,507 --> 01:18:08,225
All these faces...

1034
01:19:14,347 --> 01:19:15,336
Who is he?

1035
01:19:19,067 --> 01:19:20,136
Faubin.

1036
01:19:22,267 --> 01:19:23,097
Faubin?

1037
01:19:26,947 --> 01:19:29,620
The man who made up the name of Onoff.

1038
01:19:34,147 --> 01:19:35,296
A bum!

1039
01:19:36,067 --> 01:19:36,863
Yes...

1040
01:19:38,427 --> 01:19:39,621
A bum.

1041
01:19:45,867 --> 01:19:49,576
Is he the one who's... the
one you met yesterday evening?

1042
01:19:50,267 --> 01:19:51,416
How could I have!

1043
01:19:53,667 --> 01:19:55,498
It's to his memory that
I dedicated "The palace..."

1044
01:19:55,827 --> 01:19:57,306
Dedicated?

1045
01:20:01,627 --> 01:20:03,140
You should know that.

1046
01:20:03,347 --> 01:20:06,020
You never dedicated a book to anyone.

1047
01:20:06,627 --> 01:20:08,106
Everyone knows that.

1048
01:20:12,547 --> 01:20:13,980
That... That's impossible.

1049
01:20:14,707 --> 01:20:15,776
Impossible?

1050
01:20:30,427 --> 01:20:32,224
Please don't stain it.

1051
01:20:47,187 --> 01:20:48,302
It...

1052
01:20:49,147 --> 01:20:50,546
It's impossible!

1053
01:21:06,547 --> 01:21:07,946
Maybe you dedicated to him

1054
01:21:08,147 --> 01:21:09,057
a book that...

1055
01:21:09,267 --> 01:21:12,577
a book that was never
published? An unsubmitted book?

1056
01:21:14,227 --> 01:21:15,023
No...

1057
01:21:17,427 --> 01:21:19,463
It could only be this one.

1058
01:21:21,867 --> 01:21:23,016
Why?

1059
01:21:23,347 --> 01:21:25,815
Why this one particularly?

1060
01:21:28,267 --> 01:21:30,258
Faubin vas a vagrant.

1061
01:21:30,587 --> 01:21:33,863
The most intelligent man I ever met.

1062
01:21:34,667 --> 01:21:36,305
I never managed to learn

1063
01:21:36,507 --> 01:21:38,259
anything about his past.

1064
01:21:38,507 --> 01:21:40,259
He refused to talk about it.

1065
01:21:41,787 --> 01:21:45,496
But I always believed he'd
been someone really important.

1066
01:21:48,427 --> 01:21:52,136
When my books began to sell, I
offered to help him, but he wouldn't

1067
01:21:52,347 --> 01:21:54,178
give up his hideaways under the bridges.

1068
01:21:54,507 --> 01:21:56,259
He was a bit crazy.

1069
01:21:56,827 --> 01:22:00,103
He spent his time writing
on the backs of old calendars

1070
01:22:01,187 --> 01:22:04,384
or in notebooks, whatever he
could find in garbage cans.

1071
01:22:04,587 --> 01:22:07,977
He wrote floods and floods and
floods of words that made no sense.

1072
01:22:13,547 --> 01:22:14,866
Then one day,

1073
01:22:15,667 --> 01:22:17,658
I got a letter from him.

1074
01:22:21,147 --> 01:22:22,626
I opened it.

1075
01:22:23,867 --> 01:22:25,778
I saw that for the first time,

1076
01:22:25,987 --> 01:22:28,182
he'd written something intelligible,

1077
01:22:29,187 --> 01:22:30,905
more than intelligible.

1078
01:22:31,107 --> 01:22:32,301
Each...

1079
01:22:32,747 --> 01:22:35,307
each... each phrase reflected the most

1080
01:22:35,507 --> 01:22:37,702
subtle rules of grammar.

1081
01:22:43,627 --> 01:22:45,379
I understood that he was dead.

1082
01:22:47,147 --> 01:22:48,296
Yes, but...

1083
01:22:49,347 --> 01:22:52,862
why say you dedicated a book
to him if you didn't do it?

1084
01:22:55,227 --> 01:22:57,980
Some time later, I went
through a terrible dry spell.

1085
01:22:58,587 --> 01:23:00,259
I couldn't write.

1086
01:23:00,827 --> 01:23:02,419
I couldn't live.

1087
01:23:03,587 --> 01:23:05,305
For weeks on end

1088
01:23:05,867 --> 01:23:07,220
I sat at my desk

1089
01:23:07,747 --> 01:23:09,863
and found I have nothing to say.

1090
01:23:10,587 --> 01:23:13,738
I often thought about
that deluge of nonsense,

1091
01:23:13,947 --> 01:23:16,939
those thousands and thousands of
words which were Faubin's gift to me.

1092
01:23:18,387 --> 01:23:20,662
I began to red

1093
01:23:20,867 --> 01:23:21,936
and re-read it all.

1094
01:23:22,147 --> 01:23:24,980
- Looking for what?
- I couldn't believe that before he died

1095
01:23:25,187 --> 01:23:27,223
he wrote such a touching letter,

1096
01:23:27,587 --> 01:23:31,375
so perfect... while he'd spent his life
rummaging through humanity's garbage,

1097
01:23:32,187 --> 01:23:35,065
stringing words together
without rhyme nor reason.

1098
01:23:35,907 --> 01:23:39,866
For three years all I did was
work on this gargantuan puzzle.

1099
01:23:40,427 --> 01:23:43,260
Right, the press talked
about my silence, breakdown.

1100
01:23:43,587 --> 01:23:46,021
Writer's block, misantropia.

1101
01:23:46,507 --> 01:23:49,896
But I managed to channel my hunger

1102
01:23:50,987 --> 01:23:53,296
into a fever of excitement.

1103
01:23:57,147 --> 01:24:00,025
A thousand times I took
apart this ocean of words,

1104
01:24:00,227 --> 01:24:02,183
syllable by syllable.

1105
01:24:04,787 --> 01:24:08,223
And at last I found the
solution to the mystery.

1106
01:24:10,747 --> 01:24:13,341
It was unbelievably simple.

1107
01:24:14,147 --> 01:24:15,660
Faubin didn't write,

1108
01:24:16,507 --> 01:24:19,499
he merely copied what was

1109
01:24:19,707 --> 01:24:21,459
already written in his head.

1110
01:24:21,867 --> 01:24:25,462
He transcribed the words into 9
notebooks, all at the same time,

1111
01:24:25,667 --> 01:24:29,103
breaking down sentences the way

1112
01:24:29,307 --> 01:24:30,376
you break down a number.

1113
01:24:30,587 --> 01:24:33,784
It was rare to find two
words which made any sense,

1114
01:24:33,987 --> 01:24:36,740
next to each other, unless it was

1115
01:24:37,307 --> 01:24:38,626
by accident.

1116
01:24:39,747 --> 01:24:40,862
It was extraordinary!

1117
01:24:42,307 --> 01:24:44,696
When I'd finally reconstructed his work,

1118
01:24:44,907 --> 01:24:46,738
it was simply magnificent!

1119
01:24:46,947 --> 01:24:48,141
I never would've believed

1120
01:24:48,507 --> 01:24:50,543
anyone could write something

1121
01:24:51,107 --> 01:24:52,586
so pure,

1122
01:24:53,667 --> 01:24:54,577
so...

1123
01:24:56,387 --> 01:24:58,820
so unique.

1124
01:24:59,587 --> 01:25:01,225
I wish I could've read it.

1125
01:25:04,947 --> 01:25:06,426
You did.

1126
01:25:17,907 --> 01:25:19,977
I published it under the title
of "The Palace of Nine Frontiers".

1127
01:25:20,187 --> 01:25:22,018
"The Palace of Nine Frontiers",

1128
01:25:22,387 --> 01:25:23,900
signed by me.

1129
01:25:29,587 --> 01:25:31,896
It was a phenomenal success

1130
01:25:32,427 --> 01:25:34,179
after all those years of silence.

1131
01:25:35,507 --> 01:25:38,180
But I was finished, and only I new it.

1132
01:25:39,827 --> 01:25:43,297
Alcohol became my only joy,
and I needed joy every second.

1133
01:25:44,667 --> 01:25:48,182
I despise to my soul
everything I've written since.

1134
01:25:49,667 --> 01:25:51,862
I'll never reach such heights again.

1135
01:25:53,187 --> 01:25:56,179
But I'm condemned to write
despite everything, because

1136
01:25:56,667 --> 01:25:57,622
when I write,

1137
01:25:58,747 --> 01:26:01,465
it's as if I were drinking.

1138
01:26:03,987 --> 01:26:05,739
My art is no more than

1139
01:26:06,467 --> 01:26:08,185
a contemptible drug.

1140
01:26:09,427 --> 01:26:12,942
I hate the people who keep
pushing me to publish what I write.

1141
01:26:13,747 --> 01:26:15,100
What I write

1142
01:26:15,627 --> 01:26:17,299
solely to keep from drinking.

1143
01:26:18,107 --> 01:26:20,382
Who is pushing you to publish?

1144
01:26:20,907 --> 01:26:22,579
My editor, for one.

1145
01:26:23,067 --> 01:26:24,944
When was the last time you saw him?

1146
01:26:25,387 --> 01:26:27,184
I don't remember.

1147
01:26:27,667 --> 01:26:28,622
Yesterday?

1148
01:26:37,867 --> 01:26:39,425
You think I killed him?

1149
01:26:39,667 --> 01:26:42,022
Did he visit you at
your house on the Choron?

1150
01:26:47,867 --> 01:26:49,095
I don't remember.

1151
01:26:49,667 --> 01:26:51,498
What did you do yesterday, after

1152
01:26:52,027 --> 01:26:53,540
you looked

1153
01:26:53,747 --> 01:26:54,657
for the pictures?

1154
01:26:55,227 --> 01:26:56,262
I don't know.

1155
01:26:58,547 --> 01:27:00,219
I kept on looking...

1156
01:27:08,747 --> 01:27:09,497
Looking

1157
01:27:09,707 --> 01:27:10,617
for this?

1158
01:27:18,347 --> 01:27:20,063
Yes.

1159
01:27:27,307 --> 01:27:28,899
Where did you go after that?

1160
01:27:29,947 --> 01:27:31,016
After that...

1161
01:27:32,347 --> 01:27:34,781
I set down and stared...

1162
01:27:38,027 --> 01:27:38,985
Haven't you ever
stared out of the window

1163
01:27:39,587 --> 01:27:40,702
for hours

1164
01:27:41,187 --> 01:27:42,336
and hours,

1165
01:27:43,307 --> 01:27:44,740
without seeing anything?

1166
01:27:51,347 --> 01:27:52,302
Then?

1167
01:27:58,907 --> 01:28:00,340
Paula came.

1168
01:28:01,667 --> 01:28:02,656
Paula?

1169
01:28:04,227 --> 01:28:07,378
Up to now, you've said you
were with Danielle February!

1170
01:28:09,467 --> 01:28:12,061
Only Paula came to the farmhouse.

1171
01:28:13,027 --> 01:28:14,506
I never see Danielle.

1172
01:28:15,547 --> 01:28:16,536
Who's Paula?

1173
01:28:17,907 --> 01:28:19,056
Who's Paula?

1174
01:28:20,187 --> 01:28:21,540
Who's Paula?

1175
01:28:25,067 --> 01:28:26,295
She's everything...

1176
01:28:26,987 --> 01:28:29,455
Why wouldn't you talk about her before?

1177
01:28:31,627 --> 01:28:33,299
Because you always feel

1178
01:28:34,267 --> 01:28:35,746
great embarrassment

1179
01:28:36,507 --> 01:28:37,986
at being loved.

1180
01:28:43,107 --> 01:28:43,983
Paula.

1181
01:28:55,267 --> 01:28:56,382
So...

1182
01:28:56,907 --> 01:28:59,102
Paula came to the farmhouse with you.

1183
01:28:59,747 --> 01:29:01,578
She stayed a few days, then left.

1184
01:29:03,547 --> 01:29:05,026
Maybe even yesterday.

1185
01:29:07,147 --> 01:29:09,342
Then she came back, in the afternoon.

1186
01:29:10,187 --> 01:29:11,176
Right?

1187
01:29:11,587 --> 01:29:12,542
Yes.

1188
01:29:15,067 --> 01:29:16,978
Why'd she come back so soon?

1189
01:29:17,507 --> 01:29:18,860
What happened?

1190
01:29:21,227 --> 01:29:22,660
I don't want to go back home.

1191
01:29:25,427 --> 01:29:26,940
She wants to take you home?

1192
01:29:27,907 --> 01:29:30,341
Why does Paula to take you away?

1193
01:29:33,747 --> 01:29:34,941
I want to be alone.

1194
01:29:35,907 --> 01:29:37,306
Go with them.

1195
01:29:37,507 --> 01:29:39,303
Go with Stephane...

1196
01:29:40,067 --> 01:29:41,546
Who's with Paula?

1197
01:29:43,107 --> 01:29:44,062
Friends.

1198
01:29:44,867 --> 01:29:46,459
Insufferable friends.

1199
01:29:47,147 --> 01:29:48,262
Stephane?

1200
01:29:48,867 --> 01:29:51,540
Who's Stephane, your editor?

1201
01:29:53,027 --> 01:29:53,777
Go on.

1202
01:29:55,707 --> 01:29:57,777
Go, I'll join you tonight.

1203
01:30:00,267 --> 01:30:02,064
Why do you want to be alone?

1204
01:30:10,187 --> 01:30:11,415
You cut your hair?

1205
01:30:14,107 --> 01:30:14,744
Yes.

1206
01:30:14,947 --> 01:30:15,777
Why?

1207
01:30:16,867 --> 01:30:18,823
Why did you shave off your beard?

1208
01:30:22,427 --> 01:30:25,021
I want to look... to look at myself.

1209
01:30:25,907 --> 01:30:29,104
You want to see yourself as you
haven't seen yourself in years.

1210
01:30:29,467 --> 01:30:30,263
Then?

1211
01:30:31,187 --> 01:30:32,825
What happened then?

1212
01:30:37,107 --> 01:30:38,825
I can't find the words.

1213
01:30:40,027 --> 01:30:41,506
I don't know what to say.

1214
01:30:41,947 --> 01:30:44,097
You tried to write something?

1215
01:30:47,187 --> 01:30:48,700
You wrote this.

1216
01:31:15,027 --> 01:31:18,224
"I have nothing to say that can be said.

1217
01:31:18,667 --> 01:31:21,739
I would've preferred
silence, my faithful friend.

1218
01:31:22,267 --> 01:31:23,939
Elegant, flawless,

1219
01:31:24,587 --> 01:31:26,305
suitable for every occasion.

1220
01:31:27,547 --> 01:31:30,664
But for all that I've been
able to live in isolation

1221
01:31:31,547 --> 01:31:32,821
of the most absolute kind.

1222
01:31:33,787 --> 01:31:37,985
I now feel an absolute
desire to say thank you,

1223
01:31:39,027 --> 01:31:40,619
to apologize

1224
01:31:41,827 --> 01:31:44,466
and give some explanations,

1225
01:31:45,507 --> 01:31:46,701
a sign,

1226
01:31:47,347 --> 01:31:49,178
though I don't know what.

1227
01:31:52,547 --> 01:31:54,139
Forget me often.

1228
01:32:04,987 --> 01:32:06,102
Forget...

1229
01:32:07,147 --> 01:32:08,182
Onoff."

1230
01:34:32,267 --> 01:34:34,144
The only one you didn't recognize.

1231
01:34:35,827 --> 01:34:37,658
Faubin took it.

1232
01:34:38,387 --> 01:34:39,376
I think...

1233
01:34:39,827 --> 01:34:41,658
I think I was five.

1234
01:35:31,347 --> 01:35:33,099
I gave you my word.

1235
01:35:35,507 --> 01:35:37,498
If you still want to call...

1236
01:36:30,947 --> 01:36:31,902
Hello?

1237
01:36:32,747 --> 01:36:34,419
Paula, it's me.

1238
01:36:35,827 --> 01:36:39,536
It's me, Paula. Me,
Onoff. Do you hear me?

1239
01:36:41,947 --> 01:36:43,903
- There is nobody there
- I have to talk to you.

1240
01:36:44,147 --> 01:36:45,626
To tell you so many...

1241
01:36:46,387 --> 01:36:48,582
Listen, please listen to me!

1242
01:37:05,507 --> 01:37:06,383
Hello?

1243
01:37:07,147 --> 01:37:08,341
It's me, Onoff.

1244
01:37:09,347 --> 01:37:12,066
I have to tell you something
important, you hear?

1245
01:37:12,267 --> 01:37:13,416
- You hear?
- Hello?

1246
01:37:13,667 --> 01:37:14,895
Forgive me, Paula.

1247
01:37:16,587 --> 01:37:19,226
- Anybody there?
- I am sorry, I've done something...

1248
01:37:19,667 --> 01:37:21,339
something terrible.

1249
01:37:23,707 --> 01:37:25,618
Why can't you hear me!

1250
01:37:26,187 --> 01:37:27,825
A stupid joke.

1251
01:37:38,347 --> 01:37:41,100
Tell the Minister not to expect me.

1252
01:39:23,227 --> 01:39:25,218
Drink this, it'll do you good.

1253
01:39:28,067 --> 01:39:28,943
Go on.

1254
01:39:31,187 --> 01:39:33,143
- Is it milk?
- Yes.

1255
01:39:33,547 --> 01:39:34,775
Warm milk.

1256
01:39:35,387 --> 01:39:36,217
Drink it.

1257
01:40:02,987 --> 01:40:04,215
He doesn't know yet?

1258
01:40:04,667 --> 01:40:06,259
You didn't know, either.

1259
01:40:06,747 --> 01:40:07,782
Neither did I,

1260
01:40:08,947 --> 01:40:10,016
They didn't either,

1261
01:40:11,107 --> 01:40:12,779
or the Inspector.

1262
01:40:13,547 --> 01:40:14,696
Nobody knows

1263
01:40:15,187 --> 01:40:16,540
when they first come here.

1264
01:41:22,547 --> 01:41:23,821
Going to be a nice day.

1265
01:41:26,907 --> 01:41:28,545
A good sign, Mr. Onoff.

1266
01:41:29,587 --> 01:41:31,498
Can I ask you something?

1267
01:41:31,987 --> 01:41:32,897
Of course.

1268
01:41:33,667 --> 01:41:35,783
Can I take my pictures with me?

1269
01:41:44,947 --> 01:41:46,858
Actually, we are not supposed to...

1270
01:41:47,227 --> 01:41:49,900
We don't have the right
to do this, because

1271
01:41:50,427 --> 01:41:52,624
whatever I take away must
be put back exactly as it was.

1272
01:41:54,427 --> 01:41:55,496
You understand?

1273
01:41:56,547 --> 01:41:59,186
But who's going to
miss a few photographs

1274
01:41:59,387 --> 01:42:00,945
you yourself mislaid?

1275
01:42:03,227 --> 01:42:04,501
In my office...

1276
01:42:07,107 --> 01:42:08,335
on the table...

1277
01:42:09,347 --> 01:42:11,781
- Above the left-hand
drawer... - Your manuscript?

1278
01:42:12,387 --> 01:42:14,343
The manuscript of my new novel.

1279
01:42:14,787 --> 01:42:15,776
Did you take it?

1280
01:42:17,027 --> 01:42:17,857
No.

1281
01:42:21,027 --> 01:42:22,221
Too bad...

1282
01:42:22,427 --> 01:42:23,621
But I read

1283
01:42:23,827 --> 01:42:25,306
a few pages. It's good,

1284
01:42:25,587 --> 01:42:28,818
It's sufficient just to have a
look to say it's extraordinary.

1285
01:42:31,947 --> 01:42:33,505
It's really very, very good,

1286
01:42:34,347 --> 01:42:35,257
superb.

1287
01:42:36,187 --> 01:42:39,418
I think it's your best work,
better than the others you wrote.

1288
01:42:39,907 --> 01:42:42,262
Better than the one you
didn't write, as well.

1289
01:42:44,107 --> 01:42:45,177
It's going to be a huge success.

1290
01:42:46,427 --> 01:42:48,303
Excellent...

1291
01:42:48,787 --> 01:42:49,822
Have a nice trip.

1292
01:42:51,067 --> 01:42:52,546
Have a nice trip, Mr. Onoff.

1293
01:42:54,827 --> 01:42:56,738
Thank you, Mr. Inspector.

1294
01:42:57,347 --> 01:42:59,338
By the way, what's your name?

1295
01:43:02,147 --> 01:43:04,162
Call me Leonardo Da Vinci.

1296
01:43:04,163 --> 01:43:06,177
Thanks, Mr. Leonardo Da Vinci.

1297
01:43:06,507 --> 01:43:08,906
You are in a good job.

1298
01:43:09,987 --> 01:43:11,545
Difficult, but...
