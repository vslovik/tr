1
It will take a bad pneumonia!
2
Favor your documents.
3
I have not got them.
4
They will leave you ...
5
Just a bad pneumonia.
6
So it will be colder.
7
Do I have to wait a long time in this slum? Do I need to muddle?
8
Quiet.
9
The commissioner has been warned.
10
It's on the street.
11
At least she's dry.
12
It hurts me as well!
13
Does it seem to be in an American movie when you read my rights?
14
If he wants, he can take off his shoes.
15
I got dressed.
16
It happens from time to time when it is old.
17
Is not it true?
18
I have to call!
19
I'm sorry, I can not.
20
How would not it be possible? I have to warn that she'll be late.
21
Now you can not, do not insist.
22
I will ask the Commissioner when he arrives.
23
Otherwise, if I ask the Commissioner! We can swear! I'll tell him how I was dealing with you. Will pass very serious trouble, I'm not a stranger I!
24
Anyone you know is not special treatments here.
25
If you put him in the head!
26
Tell the Commissioner what he wants.
27
But who will ever be! Can you tell me what time it is or should I wait for Humprey Bogart?
28
It's 21.15.
29
Oh shit! ÃƒÆ ... late!
30
Do you want to stop it with this unbearable litany? - Come on!
31
And be silent!
32
Sorry, sorry ...
33
I'll have an important appointment tomorrow morning. Very.
34
With the Minister of Culture.
35
I should prepare myself, I can not miss it.
36
The commissioner is coming.
37
- Can I have a cigarette? Find a cigarette.
38
- Captain, I've never smoked. - Not even!
39
The Commissioner smokes, I hope.
40
A commissar always smokes.
41
A commissioner smokes the pipe, chews a cigar.
42
Drink this, will do you good.
43
Come on!
44
Drink, it's hot.
45
- ÃƒÂ † latte. - Yeah, it's hot milk.
46
It's good for you.
47
Drink.
48
Drink!
49
Piece of shit!
50
But what he does! Marshal! Stop! Stop!
51
Bad deal.
52
He did not want it.
53
With a timing so I would have preferred to stay under the blankets.
54
You are waking up.
55
Try to get up.
56
- Give it a hand. - I'm alone, let me. Let.
57
I guess she is the commissar.
58
Excellent supposition.
59
You have many explanations, Commissioner.
60
By what authority have his agents practically confiscated me ... ... they have prevented me from communicating with my family ... ... and they have patted me like an animal?
61
She answers me.
62
I did three simple questions.
63
Usually I ask questions here.
64
I know he's in charge of the accident, but I'm sorry for the controversy.
65
- I'm usually punctual ... - I miss her punctuality!
66
I do not feel the desire to make her acquaintance.
67
I want to know why I'm here.
68
You will enjoy your curiosity.
69
Come on. But if you let me know who I'm dealing with ... ... since it goes out in the open countryside in the evening ... ... in the middle of the flood without waterproof and without documents! It does not seem to me a crime or a crime to be without documents.
70
- They'll leave them in the wallet or on the desk ... - I'm sure. - Or in another jacket. - Of course.
71
But who do I enjoy talking about?
72
With a truck driver, a boxer, a dentist, an astrologer ... ... or a magistrate as he knows how to distinguish a crime from a crime?
73
Once people recognized me before I opened my mouth to say hello ... ... but it's not my habit to make me celebrity shield. Anyway ... ... my name is Onoff.
74
And my name is Leonardo Da Vinci.
75
Do not you believe me, Commissioner?
76
It is her right.
77
But what maybe it is not his right to stop people ... ... just because he's in the rain.
78
Do you mind so much rain, Mr. Leonardo Da Vinci?
79
I'm Onoff.
80
If you do not believe me, look for my documents.
81
It's your job, is not it?
82
I live in the farmhouse, they will be at the studio or on the table in the kitchen ... ... or in my jacket or bed.
83
"It still happens to me to doubt that I have lived those days ..." "... to have held that friendship ..." "... to have known who had just fallen under my eyes."
84
"This body was breathing and I wrote these pages."
85
"In his empty eyes he needed a look ..." "... to his lips a last lament ..." "... to this dream needed a sleeper."
86
Congratulations, his rhino is very interesting and well-written ... ... but he does not enjoy me at all and I do not understand what that means.
87
What she calls rhymes is a quotation from a novel ... ... whose author is called Onoff.
88
You're just unlucky ... ... because when you live in a place where nothing happens ... ... you have a lot of time to read and I read a lot.
89
Whole days, whole weeks ... Books on books, books on books ...
90
You can not imagine how many and I happen to read more ... ... the ones I like the most.
91
"The Palace of the Nine Borders", "Steps," "Hate," "Geometry," "Treatments of Pleasures," "Nero," "The Three Torches" ... all of Onoff's works, my favorite writer ... ... in my humble opinion, the greatest.
92
I'm just worried that it has fallen badly.
93
I know Onoff's biography as my slippers.
94
Walking at night during a thunderstorm is not serious in sÃƒÂ ©.
95
Forget the identity card in another jacket is just stupid ... ... but trying to escape a lockout ... ... then attacking the agents is even more risky.
96
Doing all these things together within a few hours ... ... declaring a false identity ... ... it's very dangerous.
97
Bryan.
98
- When you want, Commissioner. - We will not have that much. - Who was winning? - It's 45 points ... ... but the guy took the shangai. The shangai is not worth a hand that I never tremble. Prepare me a coffee.
99
Get up.
100
What's your name?
101
Do not throw it for long, its name.
102
Tell me his name.
103
Tell me his name, for God!
104
"I was near the closet ..." "... when Mrs. Doneras's car went into the yard."
105
"The maid will rush to keep the door open." "The salut." "Then ran before her."
106
"The lady will slowly step up my bowl."
107
"She was beautiful."
108
"From the pocket of the skirt pull out a piece of cooked fish ..." "... and it will begin to eat it."
109
"She was eating in front of herself without seeing anything."
110
"When the lady arrives, he shuts away from the closet ..." "... and advances to her but the lady does not look at her."
111
"He passes by, one centimeter, as it did not exist."
112
The Lady...
113
A piece of herring in the skirt pocket.
114
These are the "Steps" ... ... when Mrs. Doneras wants to leave.
115
- It's halfway through the book. - Not the "steps".
116
"The Steps," Commissioner.
117
"The stairs", third chapter.
118
The return of Druso.
119
To declare a false identity is dangerous, Leonardo Da Vinci.
120
Prince Cosimo's speech before putting majolics down.
121
"That's why I've been here since ..." "... and that this park is populated with kneeling men ..." "and fallen dancers."
122
"And so that at the corners of frescoes and walls ..." "... we see crouching figures defecating in the shadows."
123
Is it right?
124
She tells me to know my biography in memory.
125
I'm 48, I wrote essays, novels, songs ... ... articles and plays.
126
The last one, "Nero", I have directed it badly.
127
Not more than six years old.
128
Just enough?
129
Onoff!
130
The Great Onoff!
131
The great Onoff here! How could I not recognize it?
132
I do not know how to pardon me. Let me shake her hand.
133
I'm appalled by the unworthy way in which we have welcomed it.
134
- It is not a case of a tragedy. - But she's all wet.
135
Soon, dry towels and clothes! And even shoes, quick!
136
Do you want a cafe?
137
- Another cafe.
138
- All right. - May I call, please? - Of course. Only ... we see ... The lines are busy.
139
But how could I not recognize it?
140
Yet his face will be seen at least a thousand times.
141
Photos, television deform everything.
142
- They hide their faces instead of showing them. - Very true!
143
What makes a character like you do here?
144
- I have a cottage in the mountains, near the river. - Women, huh?
145
- If you like to think it. - Forgive the indiscretion. - I did not want to intrude, excuse me. - Unfortunately I rarely get there.
146
Only to work in peace, just to concentrate.
147
Are you writing a new book?
148
- Tell me I guessed. - More or less guessed.
149
It's been here for a long time?
150
I arrived Thursday, today is Sunday ... four days!
151
The beard! How did I not understand it before?
152
She always brought her beard! That's why I did not recognize it!
153
The cafÃ¨, Commissioner.
154
I brought her shoes. - Can you open please? - Yeah, sure. Arrival.
155
They are the gardener's boots.
156
- They will go wide but they are dry. - No matter, thank you.
157
Forgive me a while ago. How's your hand going?
158
Do not take it, it will survive.
159
Thanks for the boots.
160
Thank you for your indulgence towards my work.
161
It is I who have to thank her.
162
I can not imagine how happy she was to meet her ... ... that she could shake her hand that created the worlds ... ... in which I loved living.
163
I would not abuse her courtesy but if she could accompany me ...
164
- Of course. - So she'll be able to give you back the uniform and boots.
165
Master, I'm very embarrassed, I do not know how to tell her.
166
Documents? They will also have them.
167
This is not the point.
168
- What else is there then? - Nothing serious, I assure you.
169
I would like to stay a little longer.
170
Okay, if you think it's necessary ... It's nothing serious, just a formality.
171
- I will not take too long. - I should be grateful, I'm tired.
172
But she has to call!
173
Give me the number, let me call you.
174
... 3396. Easy to repeat.
175
Is his house number?
176
No, my friend answers.
177
Pass this number on the direct ... ... 93633396.
178
Could I know what he's dealing with his new book?
179
You will not want to give me an interview, I hope.
180
If he knows me well as he says, I will never release it.
181
Of course, I know, even though I never understood why.
182
Interviews are always useless.
183
One comes to you to hear what he knows ... ... for the pleasure of hearing you repeat. Is not it ridiculous? - In a way, yes.
184
But it is not my case.
185
I want you to tell me everything he did on the day today ... ... and I assure you I do not know.
186
AlIora is not an interview, it's just an interrogation.
187
Call it as you please, but please help me.
188
It's not easy for me to ask certain things to a man I think. - Then do not ask me. - I have to do it, Mr. Onoff.
189
I have to do it in her interest.
190
As you can see we are alone, we will not get verbal drafts.
191
Tell me exactly how his day went. Eventually, they will accompany you and leave you in peace.
192
- Do not you have a cigarette? - No one here smokes.
193
Let it go, it does not do anything.
194
Smoke a lot?
195
Three packages a day, last time even more.
196
- And today? - Today I must have pulverized my record.
197
- What time did you wake up this morning? - Under 3.30.
198
- How is it so precise? - I wake up every day at 3:30. I do not sleep a lot. An hour, an hour and a half, never more than two. It will be ten years old that I always wake up at the same time.
199
- As the protagonist of "Geometry"! - As the protagonist of "Geometry".
200
- It's a craze! - It's true, I admit it.
201
I was surprised when he did not recognize my quote ...
202
... "His lips needed a last lament."
203
Do you remember all the names of the people you suspect ... ... who arrested, interrogated, beaten in jail?
204
Remember their faces, hair color? Did you keep the memory of their words? I do not believe!
205
You can not remember everything.
206
The fragment you mentioned earlier ... could be derived from "The Palace of the Ninth Frontier."
207
But that's right!
208
It is the beginning of the last chapter. - Great! - We talked about insomnia.
209
I too suffered insomnia for many years.
210
I've tried all the medicines, the treatments, and the possible remedies.
211
Sleepers do not end!
212
No way.
213
Then a few years ago, suddenly, I'm completely cured. So, suddenly!
214
Do not despair, maybe it will happen to her.
215
I do not need sleeping or nursing.
216
I was in good health with insomnia. He is my best co-worker. It's just thanks to her that I work when everyone else sleeps.
217
- She also worked last night. - Less than usual. - Are you sleepy again? - No.
218
So what did he do?
219
I looked long at the ceiling and the ceiling looked long at me.
220
Alone.
221
Was he alone in bed?
222
She is an investigator of infinite delicacy.
223
- Yeah, I was alone. - Just ... continue.
224
I got up before she roared the cock.
225
I wore the dressing gown and slipped my slippers.
226
Then I went to the kitchen.
227
I caught a coffee in the company of a teaspoon of sugar.
228
Then I did the shit.
229
I scratched my head, washed it ... ... I dressed, I phoned ... ... then rewrote what I wrote yesterday ... ... and I took notes on what I'm going to write tomorrow .
230
So I took a walk.
231
After I got back home and I put in order the junk.
232
And then?
233
And then I went to the station to take my agent.
234
- How is your agent called? - Daniela. - Daniela come?
235
Daniela February.
236
He went to the station to take Daniela February.
237
- And then? - We had lunch and talked about work.
238
- In the afternoon I returned to the station. - At what time?
239
Between 17 and 18.
240
- She's playing and I'm home. - At what time?
241
- You will be the 19th. - And then?
242
- And then ... - And then ...? And then?
243
I do not remember very well.
244
Do not you remember very well?
245
I can not remember anything.
246
Can not remember?
247
He just left the station ... ... he's back home, I'm 19 ...
248
I can not remember more. - I do not remember ... I do not remember. - But it's absurd!
249
Do not you remember what he did just four hours ago?
250
- Does this look normal to you? - Is it a crime not to remember?
251
Do you want to tease me?
252
- She wants to get around! - He tired me!
253
What do you want me to do? What importance can it have?
254
- Why should I get her around? - Re-start, force!
255
Things change, dear Onoff.
256
I had the desire to help her.
257
I admire her and her works ... ... but as long as she does not agree with her memory ...
258
... They will not come out of here. - I do not know what to do with his help. What do you suspect in his failed half-caste police headquarters?
259
Next, the name.
260
His name.
261
It's a very simple question, dear Onoff!
262
- I will not answer before he let me call. - Can not!
263
If you put it well in your head.
264
I can not deny the right to call my lawyer.
265
I will answer your questions only in the presence of my lawyer.
266
I know perfectly his rights.
267
But if you do nothing but deny it all!
268
First his guardian angels "I ask the Commissioner" ... ... then she "give me the number, let me call him on the direct."
269
Why can not I call from this police station?
270
The lines are broken, are you doing well so?
271
Throughout my life as a novelist ... - ... I have never breathed such an exuberance of imagination! - ÃƒÃ † la veritÃƒÂ.
272
When there is a thunderstorm, the phone lines always jump. Indeed, strange that the light has not gone yet.
273
- You could tell me before! - I'll give you my word.
274
When the lines are junctured, you will be the first to call.
275
- His name. - Why this interrogation? - His name, please! - Why this interrogation?
276
Tonight not far from his farmhouse was murdered.
277
Sit down, please.
278
In my opinion, the assassin has already found.
279
I do not even think I'm joking that she is a murderer ... ... but if you stubbornly say that she does not remember what she did tonight ... ... she will have to suspect that she is.
280
- His name! Respond! - My name is Onoff!
281
- Place and date of birth. - February 3, 1946, Auver-sur.
282
- Profession? - Writer. - is married? - Twice married.
283
- That means? - My first wife died shortly after our wedding.
284
- Under what circumstances? - Cancer.
285
- When did he get married? - I divorced nine years ago.
286
- Sons? - Nobody.
287
- Criminal record? - What do you want to know? How many times have I stolen at the supermarket? Or how many other murders I committed before tonight?
288
Denying to have criminal records.
289
- What did he come to do here? - I told you before.
290
I've reached my mountain cottage to concentrate, to work ... ... far from everyone ... ... far from the world, far from the police commissioners.
291
- Did she come to work alone? - Just a moment, Commissioner.
292
- Was she alone in her cottage? - No.
293
- And who was it with? - With my wife.
294
Is he married a third time?
295
I meant ex-wife, indeed with my ex-second wife.
296
- Have you reconciled? - No, we see you regularly.
297
Let's say we're good friends.
298
How many bedrooms are in his cottage?
299
My ex wife and I are sleeping together if that's what she wants to know.
300
When you looked at the ceiling at 3:30 it was not just!
301
- It seems obvious to me. - Why did he first say that he was alone?
302
I did not say that, check his record.
303
She said she woke up before she could sing the cock ... ... and she was alone. - I'll be wrong!
304
So you are always alone.
305
- How many days has he come to his farmhouse? - Nine days.
306
- How do you make sure? - If I say 9 days, it's 9 days!
307
- First he said 4 days. - Did I say 4 days? SÃƒÂ¬. I have not noticed.
308
I lose the notion of time when I work. You work to lose consciousness.
309
Dear Mr. Onoff ... ... as long as he is contradicted in his poems, in his novels, that's all right. But if you continue to contradict yourself when there is a murder ... ... it's okay!
310
Still a little and we all drown.
311
We do it now, Commissioner.
312
How do you live in a place like this?
313
How do we live in a place like this?
314
We are ready, Commissioner.
315
Excuse me, please.
316
Say.
317
First in the closet I saw wine bottles.
318
Could I have...?
319
This wine is very good.
320
From these parts they say it is miraculous.
321
- Please, drink. - Thank you.
322
Thank you.
323
- Good, huh? - It's just good.
324
- Good. - She's still drinking.
325
Worth as a wish: good birthday, master. Today is February 3rd.
326
Yeah, it's true. It's my birthday.
327
- Teacher, can I ask you a question? - Do not you know anything else here?
328
Before you get angry because I whistled that motive, remember?
329
I did not have it with her. Believe me, I'm sorry.
330
Strength, give him a hand.
331
I know I'm not intoned ... ... but did she recognize it? - Of course I recognized her.
332
It's a beautiful song. How many times will it be heard around the world! But that song is a piece of my life.
333
What did I say about light? When it rains...
334
Teacher, sit here and do not move.
335
Will they, where are the candles?
336
I'm from there, look for lÃƒÂ.
337
- Hurry up. - All right.
338
Master! Master, do not ... Do you like wine, huh? Where did the glass put it?
339
Help ... Mum ... Open, AndrÃ ©! Wake up! It's nothing!
340
- His name. - Onoff.
341
Place and date of birth.
342
Auver-sur, on February 3rd, San Biagio's day.
343
- Which year? - 1946.
344
- Profession? - Writer.
345
- Married? - Twice.
346
- Sons? - Zero.
347
How many days has he arrived at his mountain cottage?
348
Four.
349
Before he had said four, then nine, now four.
350
Four.
351
And with whom did he come?
352
With my ex-second wife.
353
- What's your second ex-wife's name? - Daniela.
354
Daniela February.
355
- Was not she your agent? - it's the same.
356
- What does it mean? - My ex-second wife is my agent.
357
- She's back at the station? - SÃƒÂ¬.
358
- At what time? - Before the dusk.
359
- Then what did he do? - I stayed home.
360
Has she stayed home or is she home?
361
I repeat, I stayed all day at home.
362
All day.
363
Can I have wine?
364
If she stayed all day at home ... ... how could she accompany Daniela February to the station?
365
I did not accompany her, she went alone.
366
After she left who came to visit her at home?
367
Nobody.
368
- Are you sure? - I remained alone.
369
I did not come out all night, please believe me.
370
What did he do after the departure of his agent? What did he do after the departure of his agent? Respond!
371
I do not remember what I did after that.
372
- He said he did not go out all day.
373
- SÃƒÂ¬ ...
374
How do you know if he says he does not remember what he did next?
375
What did I do next?
376
- Are you still at home until you keep a clear memory? - SÃƒÂ¬.
377
It can therefore be released later.
378
I do not remember.
379
She no longer has to remember.
380
By now he has to confess that he has told me a lot of bales!
381
First said she came to the farmhouse alone ... ... to have received her agent's visit ... ... and to have her escorted to the station between 17 and 18.
382
Then he thinks back to us: he has come with his wife ... ... in fact, his former wife, who is also the agent.
383
But he did not return to the station, he left alone.
384
Mr. Onoff ...
385
... at that station there is only one fucking train ... ... that has never stopped for a single fuckin 'minute ... ... since she came to her cottage ... ... for the simple reason that there has never been a station here.
386
Never.
387
She is not worthy of the works she has written.
388
His novels, his tales, his poems, his songs ... ... are worth more than her. - I hope so.
389
Tell the truth, confess! He is taking the biggest cantonage of his not brilliant career.
390
So why did he try to escape like a thief of hens, eh?
391
Why do not you prove his innocence and do not clear my suspicions?
392
I tell him why he does not. Because she has committed a murder for tonight.
393
I do not know if someone was killed and where he was killed.
394
And if someone was killed, I do not know if she's an old lady ... ... a kid, a goat, a scarecrow!
395
She does not know anything about it, but we will tell who the victim is.
396
He accuses me of being a murderer ... ... and pretends to know who the victim is from me!
397
What kind of policeman is he? A sick man! A fool!
398
I've never been a great cop and maybe they will never be ... ... but in my not brilliant career I've been involved in so many homicides.
399
Many have not been able to solve them ... ... for others I've built solutions that have turned out to be wrong. In some cases luck has given me the opportunity ... ... to take the exact reasoning and find some small key ... ... to work in some small lock.
400
A few times I hit the target because of my only intelligence.
401
But this is the first time I get caught in a murder ... ... whose only enigma to solve is the assassin's identity.
402
Unfortunately, I'm not in the condition to do so ... ... because her victim has a horribly disfigured face ... ... and he will not be able to identify before tomorrow.
403
Do you know what I think?
404
No.
405
That she murdered her.
406
And I'm a good scapegoat arrived at the right time.
407
- How do you know he's a man? - What a man? She said, "Do you know what I think?"
408
She wants to tell me things I did not say.
409
But I know it's a man!
410
I do not know anything, she's confusing the waters to make me contradict.
411
You know better than me if he is a man or a woman.
412
He has no evidence and he will not be a blanket of memory.
413
An empty memory banal!
414
Here it is.
415
"Not to die of anguish or shame ..." "... men are condemned to forget the unpleasant things."
416
"They are more unpleasant before they begin to forget about it."
417
It's a phrase, my dear Onoff!
418
The man who wrote this great truth ... ... must have done something very unpleasant tonight ... ... not to remember what he did a few hours ago. If the writers knew in what mouths they would end their writing ... ... they would cut their hand.
419
And it would be a pity!
420
Do you believe in God? After all, he is the top writer.
421
If he knew how mediocre those works would be, he would have to give up too many things. - It's not hard to believe in God.
422
It has happened to me hundreds of times ... ... but on many occasions I confess I felt ashamed of Him.
423
He would have been an excellent writer if he was limited to describing landscapes.
424
- Excuse me, Commissioner. - I'm confused.
425
He affirms that God is an author of irrelevant importance.
426
Because when I quote a book, do I feel so annoyed?
427
My job is to write, to hear about my books I do not care.
428
Language does not work much to nothing in this world.
429
It is used for police interrogations.
430
Now I understand why it does not publish anything more than six years.
431
I had thought of another creative crisis.
432
What does it refer to?
433
In the three years of silence that preceded the exit of "The Palace of the Nine Borders".
434
It has not been so long ... ... but I remember the newspapers talking about crises ... ... or the terror of the white page.
435
Bravo!
436
She knows me more than I do not remember myself. - Compliments! - We can bet.
437
Disappointed?
438
Sincerely, yes.
439
You should never meet your own myths.
440
Seeing close by you realize they have boobs.
441
Risks to discover that the great works that made you dream so much ... ... they thought you were sitting on the pussy ... ... waiting for a drain of diarrhea.
442
Do you think you have many enemies? - Of course!
443
One of them came to me today to get my tongues and I killed him.
444
Have you ever owned firearms?
445
- No. - Are you sure?
446
I never owned any kind of weapon.
447
I can not shoot and I have never fired.
448
Let the truth tell the corpse that he hid down. How does he say there is a corpse?
449
I saw him with my eyes as you pulled him out of the van. You can accuse me of abusing someone of his agents ... ... everything else is chatting, he has no evidence against me.
450
He has no motive to accuse me of murder!
451
She says she does not know who the victim is.
452
Tomorrow will have an appointment with the Minister of Culture.
453
- Let me go, otherwise ... - It's about to commit another crime.
454
I advise you to be silent.
455
Sit down.
456
I will follow his advice to keep silent.
457
Dear Onoff ... ... maybe I will not be able to prove his guilt. In a sense, I even wish him.
458
But know she will not go to any appointment with any minister ... ... until he tells me what he did last night after sunset ... ... at the cost of telling me that he was sitting all the time drink ... ... waiting for a diarrhea attack!
459
Commissioner, do you want me to move my desk?
460
PerchÃƒÂ ©? It'll be awake.
461
I have the impression that the night will be long.
462
Go on.
463
Has your former second wife resigned?
464
Do you live with someone?
465
Do you have a lover?
466
I will follow his advice to keep silent. As impressive as it may seem ... ... suppose none of you know the place well ... ... and that his former second wife did not go to the station ... ... but rather to look for a any station nearby to leave.
467
But then how did he think he was going to retrieve the car?
468
I will follow his advice to keep silent.
469
Maybe he went looking for the station accompanied by someone else ... ... someone who then came back to his cottage. Who?
470
I will follow his advice to keep silent.
471
Or just just does not play.
472
Perhaps her ex-wife was still holding her company ... ... but in this case where had she been stopped by my agents?
473
And why did he go so far as to not have more breath to talk?
474
I will follow his advice to keep silent.
475
Is 93633396 the number of his former second wife?
476
I will follow his advice to keep silent.
477
You specifically asked to call this number ... ... and he insinuated that the victim could be a man to protect himself ... ... to defeat.
478
Is the victim the 93633396 woman?
479
And if it's not her ... ... how many want it to be the victims of a lonely successful man ... ... that nobody has seen around for several years?
480
How many people do you know so well that you can get to him in a place ... ... where you say you go very rarely?
481
The circle can not be infinite.
482
A friend?
483
A lover?
484
A relative?
485
The driver? A secretary?
486
Your doctor? Your lawyer?
487
One of your collaborators?
488
A journalist?
489
A photographer looking for scoop?
490
A student who breaks her soul with a list of idiotic questions?
491
His publisher?
492
Who among these came to visit her yesterday afternoon?
493
I will follow his advice to keep silent.
494
She comes from a military family, her father was a war hero ... ... She was an officer ... ... and she wants me to drink that she has never had a gun between the hands?
495
Will it still follow my advice to keep silent?
496
Enough! Stop it, Onoff!
497
Basta cosÃ¬.
498
Now we change music, Onoff.
499
You do not mind me.
500
His biography is known all over the world, I know her by heart.
501
"He was born into a ditch on the edge of a field."
502
"With your teeth she cut the cord." "He made a knot and he left."
503
"They called him Biagio February ..." "... because he was found on a cold February night ..." "... and it was San Biagio's day."
504
Biagio February I am.
505
My biography is false.
506
From beginning to end I wrote it myself.
507
It was an old man who invented a name suitable for a writer ... ... the name of Onoff.
508
It was called Foben. My best friend.
509
It was he who made me great.
510
I've never been to the army.
511
I can not shoot.
512
I grew up ... ... in an orphanage.
513
They only gave us milk. Every day warm milk, morning and evening.
514
I hate hot milk.
515
Paola, do you make me a coffee please? Get me a coffee.
516
I had a dream ... ... a horrible dream.
517
I dreamed that I had killed my publisher. I recovered my manuscript and ran, ran, ran to you.
518
But your house was a police station ... ... and there was a terrible commissioner ... ... who recited my novels by memory.
519
Paola, get me a sheet before you forget everything.
520
Paola!
521
Ah!
522
I've never seen the commissar so worried.
523
- It's really in trouble. - It's a terrible situation. You will see that it will end there.
524
- The marshal says no. - I can not stand the Marshal.
525
Do as if there was not. Bottom is a good person.
526
- Everyone's good here. - I still have to get used to it. I need time.
527
- What time will it be?
528
She only slept for an hour.
529
Do you want to warm up a bit?
530
Could I have paper? I have to take notes.
531
If it is OK.
532
Give him some hot wine.
533
- Do you have an idea for a new book? - You do not write why you have an idea. It is written because you do not know anything else.
534
Shit!
535
Shit!
536
- I'm mortified ... - Keep silent at least.
537
Be silent.
538
When I tell him, I will not believe anyone.
539
How can such a place be absurd?
540
This is not the ideal place for one as she traveled so much.
541
Here we are not equipped with anything, we are not in a beautiful city. - Here we have only the woods. - I've been working here for 15 years.
542
I've always found myself well, I would not go back to the city even dead.
543
Could I Use Your Typewriter?
544
Logic would be logical, but it must ask the Commissioner. Ask him.
545
Can you kill ... ... and then forget it?
546
Remember, remember it's like a dip at the bottom of the sea. Remember, remember what is to be deleted. And forgetting, and forgetting ... is that you lose things. And forgetting, and forgetting ... will end rare joys. And forgetting, and forgetting ... is that you lose things.
547
Have you ever seen this man, Mr. February?
548
I seem to know it.
549
Who is it?
550
He was my high school math teacher.
551
And then?
552
I need him all my love for numbers, symmetries ... geometric reasoning.
553
Professor Trivarchi.
554
Demonstrate the theorems as they tell the fairy tales.
555
His words did not come to our ears ... ... they reached our brain directly.
556
I learned from her lessons a genuine enjoyment.
557
Two parallel lines never meet ... ... however you can imagine the existence of a point ... ... so far in space ... ... but so far in the infinite .. ... that you can believe and admit ... ... that the two faces meet you.
558
Here it is.
559
We will call that point "improper point".
560
Never seen. Are you sure?
561
- So then? - SÃƒÂ¬ ...
562
- Yeah, I know her. - Would you say that?
563
A girl I loved.
564
When did you last see it?
565
One morning I left her in the hotel while she slept ... ... and I went to the airport ... ... without even greeting her.
566
Twenty years ago.
567
How did you get these photos?
568
- Try to understand it alone. - I've been looking for you for so long.
569
Did you look for her even last night?
570
Yeah, I've been looking for you last night too.
571
For years I've been freaking everywhere and I do not find them ... ... but not just those two, there were so many. - A mountain of photographs.
572
- Why are they so important?
573
They are the testimony of a strange habit ... ... or if they prefer a pity I've had throughout my life.
574
I took a camera with me and collected the faces I met. A bizarre way to keep a diary!
575
A game that I abandoned the day I made the decision ... ... to withdraw from public life.
576
Later, I lost everything.
577
In those photos there are my friends and my opponents ... ... People I love and love ... ... and those I did not know and did not want to love.
578
People who held my hand and smiled at me. And those who just looked at me ... ... without saying anything. Thousands, thousands, thousands of faces.
579
- Where did she get it? - I searched for her cottage.
580
Evidently he did not look good.
581
Look look! All these faces ...
582
Who is it?
583
ÃƒÃ † Foben.
584
Foben?
585
He who invented the name Onoff.
586
A bitch?
587
SÃƒÂ¬.
588
A bitch.
589
He who met last night?
590
And how could I have?
591
In his memory I dedicated "The Palace of the Nine Borders."
592
Dedicated?
593
You should know, she has never dedicated a book to anyone.
594
Everybody knows.
595
It is impossible.
596
Impossible?
597
Do not dirty it, please.
598
It's not ... it's not possible!
599
Perhaps he will dedicate to Foben his unpublished book.
600
No...
601
It could only be that.
602
Why this one?
603
Foben was a vagrant.
604
He was the most intelligent man I've ever met.
605
I never got to know her past.
606
He did not want to talk about it.
607
I've always believed it was an important personality.
608
After the success of my first books I offered him to change life ... ... but he never wanted to abandon his den under a bridge.
609
He was an out of head.
610
She spent time writing on the back of old calendars or notebooks ... ... or whatever she found in the dustbin.
611
And he wrote rivers, rivers, and rivers of words. Nonsense words.
612
One day a letter was delivered to me. I opened it ... ... and I noticed for the first time that he had written something legible ... ... more readable. Each sentence respected the most subtle grammatical rules.
613
I knew he was dead.
614
Why does he say he has dedicated a book if he did not?
615
After a while I went through a very painful period.
616
I could not write and I could not live.
617
I spent whole weeks sitting at the desk ... ... without finding anything in me to say.
618
I often thought of that unreadable stream of words on words ... ... that Foben left me in gift.
619
- I filled the days by reading that stuff. - What did he hope to find? It was not possible for a moment before death to write a letter ... ... so perfect after spending a lifetime chasing waste ... ... to align meaningless words.
620
For three years I was only concerned with that monstrous rebus.
621
The newspapers talked of my silence, impotence, aphasia, misanthropy ... ... but I was able to transform my hunger into an endless excitement.
622
Thousands of times I dismounted and resumed that indecipherable ocean ... ... after silvia ... ... and finally I discovered the mystery.
623
It was an incredible simplicity.
624
Foben did not write. He copied what was perfectly written in his mind.
625
He conveyed the words simultaneously on 9 notebooks ... ... breaking down the sentences in the same way that the numbers are disintegrating.
626
It was rare to find two terms that were meaningful next to each other ... ... if not accidentally.
627
It was extraordinary.
628
Finally, I could recomposure the story.
629
I could not even imagine you could write something ... ... so pure ... ... so authentic.
630
I would have liked to read it.
631
He did.
632
Let me print this novel: "The palace of the nine frontiers" ... ... under my signature.
633
Success was amazing ... ... after so many years of silence.
634
But I was a finished man and I knew only myself.
635
Alcohol became my only joy, I needed it every second.
636
I deeply disdain what I wrote later on.
637
They will not be able to reach that level.
638
I'm condemned to write the same thing because when I write ... ... it's like drinking.
639
My art is nothing but a miserable medicine.
640
I hate those who want me to publish what I write.
641
What I'm just writing about not drinking.
642
Who wants to persuade her to publish again?
643
My publisher, for example.
644
- When did you see him last time? - I can not remember it.
645
Was it yesterday?
646
- Do you think he killed him? - I came to see him at the farmhouse.
647
- I do not remember anything. - What did he do afternoon after ... ... after he was looking for photographs in the attic?
648
I do not know. I kept looking. Did you try this? SÃƒÂ¬.
649
After what time did he go?
650
After that I sat and looked. Has it ever been hours and hours to watch from a window? Hours and hours without seeing anything.
651
And then what did he do?
652
Paola is back.
653
Paola?
654
So far he had said he was in the company of Daniela February.
655
Only Paola was at the farmhouse.
656
- Daniela never see her. - Who's Paola?
657
Who is Paola?
658
Who is Paola?
659
ÃƒÂ † everything.
660
Why did not she want to talk about her before?
661
Because it is a great discomfort to be loved.
662
Paola.
663
So Paola came with her to the farmhouse.
664
After a few days she left.
665
Maybe last night.
666
Then in the afternoon she came back to her, so what?
667
SÃƒÂ¬.
668
Why is it coming back so soon? What happened?
669
I do not want to go back home.
670
Do you want to bring her home?
671
Why does Paola want to take her away?
672
I want to stay alone, go away with them.
673
Go away with Caesar.
674
Who is there with Paola?
675
Friends, unbearable friends.
676
Caesar.
677
Who is Caesar? His publisher?
678
I'll get you tonight, go away.
679
Why do you want to stay alone?
680
She cut her hair.
681
- SÃƒÂ¬. - Why?
682
Why did she shave her beard?
683
I want to look at myself.
684
He wanted to see his face as he did not see for so many years.
685
And after he did?
686
I do not find the words.
687
I do not know what to write.
688
She tried to write something.
689
He wrote this.
690
"I have nothing to say that can be said."
691
"I would have preferred silence, my most faithful friend ..." "... elegant, infallible, suitable for everything." "But as far as he has been able to live in isolation ..." "... the most complete ..." "... now abstain the absurd desire to thank, sorry ..." "... give an explanation. " "A sign, which I would not know ..." "Forget me often." "Forget ... Onoff!"
692
It is the only one who has not recognized it.
693
Foben had done it.
694
It's been five years in this photo.
695
I had given her my word, Master.
696
If you still want to call ...
697
Ready? Paola, it's me. - It's me, Paola! - Ready? - Can you hear me? - But who is it? - I have to talk to you, tell you many things. - Ready? - Please listen to me! - Ready? - Ready? - It's me, Onoff! I must tell you something very important. - Ready? - Forgive me, Paola! - What I did is terrible ... - I do not feel anything, ready! Ready? Ready? Why do not you hear me, Paola?
698
Tell the Minister I do not expect more.
699
Drink, it's good for you.
700
Drink.
701
- ÃƒÃ † latte? - SÃƒÂ¬.
702
Warm milk. It will do you good.
703
Do not know anything yet? You did not even know that either. Not even them, not even the commissar. Nobody knows when he comes here.
704
Nice day.
705
Good sign, dear Onoff.
706
- There is something I would like to ask. - Please.
707
Could I take my photographs with me?
708
In fact we would not have the right to do it because ... ... everything I pick up has to be put in place.
709
But who will notice the disappearance of his lost photos?
710
In the study ... ... there was a desk ... - A manuscript? Did he even pick up the manuscript of my last book?
711
No.
712
- Sin. - But I've read a few pages ... ... just enough to realize that it's magnificent. Unparalleled. Sublime.
713
In my opinion his most beautiful book ... ... the best among the things he wrote among those he did not write.
714
It will be a huge success.
715
And now a good trip.
716
Good trip, master.
717
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
718
I do not know his name.
719
Call me Leonardo Da Vinci too.
720
Thank you, Mr. Leonardo Da Vinci.
721
She does a good job ... ... difficult but ...
722
